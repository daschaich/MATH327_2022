1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,700
All right, we'll start getting under way.  Welcome back to the

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,060
second half of the first part of this week and I'll

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:20,850
remember to put up the six-digit number first this time. It is eight seven two

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,360
six five seven.

5
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:34,170
That can sit there for the rest of the hour and we can pick

6
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,940
up pretty much where we left off yesterday, which

7
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,050
was essentially the end of the non-relativistic

8
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,580
fermion gas at low temperatures, where we came up

9
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,770
with, essentially, the equation of states.  And I

10
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,610
can check if there are questions lingering from

11
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,170
last time about what we got to,

12
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:02,640
or anything different.

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,920
But now this result here in this gap is indeed

14
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,460
the equation of state for this non relativistic

15
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,180
fermion gas at low temperature. So it's the usual

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,430
target we've been going after with all these

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,540
quantum gases into the classical ideal gas before

18
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,160
that written in a few different ways, relieving

19
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,450
the pressure either to the energy density, the

20
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,810
density times, the chemical potential new or.

21
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,690
Fighting in the relation between that number of

22
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,480
density and chemical potential for the low

23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,500
temperature for gas, just in terms of the

24
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,550
intensity of the number of particles per unit

25
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,400
volume raised to the five thirds power, and what

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,660
is unusual about this result compared to the

27
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,820
equation of states that we derive from the

28
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,320
classical ideal gas PV equals A.. Which also

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,540
persisted with just a minor change in numerical

30
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,470
constants for photon gas is that there is no

31
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,320
dependence on the temperature at all in any of

32
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,850
these relations. The energy and density are

33
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,950
independent of temperature, at least for a

34
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,210
sufficiently low temperatures, leaving this

35
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,180
constant temperature, independent pressure or

36
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,830
equation state that we can plot here as the low

37
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,650
temperature limit on the more general expression

38
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,610
in some python code will produce notes and

39
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,270
interpolate between this low temperature, constant

40
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,540
equation of state and the classical ideal gas law

41
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,530
at high temperatures where the pressure becomes

42
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,650
linear and the temperature with that.

43
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,810
Proportionality just be the number that's

44
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:09,500
available, so. Having. Reached the equation of

45
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,970
state for the non relativistic, at least at low

46
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:21,050
temperatures, we can see this at work. In physics

47
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,510
of a certain type of supernova explosion of stars

48
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,550
and maybe before going on to that, I should also

49
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:34,310
reiterate the overall physical picture that led to

50
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,850
the equations that we found where we had the idea

51
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,240
of all the particles in this gas filling up energy

52
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,600
levels one after the next until they reach the

53
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,200
maximum energy level at which all the particles

54
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,260
are accounted for that corresponds to that Fermi

55
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,890
energy. So that is a very useful picture of what's

56
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:59,720
going on behind the mathematics to explain both

57
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,710
why the energy and pressure are independent of

58
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,660
temperature and low temperatures, as well as why

59
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,600
that chemical potential has to be positive in that

60
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
regime with only a single microstates

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,990
corresponding to that organization, of all the

62
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,860
particles filling all of the energy levels with a

63
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,490
low energy up to that maximum very energy.

64
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,650
And that sort of physical picture is essentially

65
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,140
what's realized in certain types of stars and

66
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,840
particular.

67
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,390
Very dense stars known as Whitehorse that are

68
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,780
related to these type of a supernova explosions of

69
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:52,430
stars and as a prelude to seeing how that operates,

70
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,800
just mentioned that the.

71
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,550
The question here is, how low does a temperature

72
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,010
have to be at practice in order for this low

73
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,950
temperature equation states to be valid? So that

74
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,420
constant pressure that we derived yesterday is

75
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:16,040
known as the university pressure and. The

76
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,190
terminology here is not exactly perfect, it's

77
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,830
something you inherited from the past, so the

78
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,930
degeneracy is unrelated to the multiple energy

79
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,440
levels that we all have the same value of the

80
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,740
energy. The idea is that at these low temperatures,

81
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,660
all the particles in this gas want to be at the

82
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,330
lowest possible energy, which is to say that the

83
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,600
very direct distribution exponentially suppresses

84
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,630
the occupation probability for energy levels with

85
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:53,480
higher values of the energy. And as close to equal

86
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,880
energies as these fermions can get is the system

87
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,390
where all the energy levels are are filled up. So

88
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,980
they're trying to be degenerate, but can't quite

89
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,420
make it due to the point exclusion principle. And

90
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,350
in order to.

91
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,150
Have this non-zero degeneracy pressure in order to

92
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,980
realize this physical picture where all of the

93
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,690
particles are trying to fill the low energy energy

94
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,230
levels due to the low temperature that.

95
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,490
Temperature has to be low relative to that Fermoy

96
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,410
energy. The highest energy level that is filled in

97
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,080
the limit of zero temperature and the place where

98
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,140
any additional Hermione's being added to the gas

99
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:52,210
would have to enter the first energy levels

100
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,840
available for them to fill up so long as the

101
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,310
temperature is small compared to the energy we can.

102
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:09,610
Rely on having a. Nonzero generosity, pressure and

103
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,780
the zero temperature limit. And just from the

104
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,140
definition of the energy that we had. We looked at

105
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,480
yesterday, which may as well write down, so we

106
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,210
have here.

107
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:33,260
That up at the top of the page from the energy was

108
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:40,560
squared. Over to the three PI squared and then the

109
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,280
average particle density arrays to the two thirds

110
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,840
power. So we can see that this dependence on that

111
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,490
density of two thirds is increasing the energy as

112
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,420
the density increases, which becomes particularly

113
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,570
relevant for stars, where the gravitational

114
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,210
attraction of an enormous amount of matter is

115
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,210
introducing very high densities and

116
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,240
correspondingly high ferme energies. So that's

117
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,990
even ordinary temperatures that we would consider

118
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,050
every day. Levels not particularly low turn out to

119
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,710
be very small compared to the energy. So just to

120
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,280
give some illustrations matter, like this table

121
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,940
tends to have roughly an Avogadro's number worth

122
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,860
of particles in a cubic centimeter of changing.

123
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,210
Units to adults per cubic meter, we have something

124
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:45,670
like 10 to be twenty three times two to convert

125
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,600
from centimeter commuter times, a cube to get from

126
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,120
all three dimensions of space takes us up to ten

127
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,780
to twenty nine atoms per cubic meter. And this

128
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,110
I'll just tell you, if you plug in the conversion

129
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,040
factor between the topic units, energies and

130
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,880
temperatures corresponds to a fairly energy of

131
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,970
about ten thousand Kelvin. So that even the

132
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,160
temperature is two orders of magnitude lower that

133
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,580
we are working in right now, our low temperatures

134
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,720
compared to the very of everyday metals, for

135
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,720
instance, electrons moving around in the metal.

136
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,050
If we consider those white dwarf stars I mentioned

137
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,090
earlier, we have. Energies that are about a

138
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,620
hundred thousand times larger, which correspond to

139
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,850
densities that are then. One hundred thousand

140
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,900
times to the power, three halves larger, so things

141
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,110
like ten of the thirty six atoms per cubic meter,

142
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,780
which you can plug in the relation between

143
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,250
temperature and atomic mass units, is usually

144
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,290
talked about in terms of about one ton of mass per

145
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,340
cubic centimeter.

146
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,030
And this is. About a million times more dense than

147
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:22,490
our sun. So back to 10 of the six, that would be

148
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,670
what we got if we tried to cram all of the matter

149
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:30,500
in our son into a volume. About the size of the

150
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,350
earth, one hundred times smaller radius or one

151
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,250
hundred cubed is a million times smaller in volume.

152
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:43,070
So that is the context for the sorts of energy,

153
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,700
the temperatures, where we want to apply our low

154
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,690
temperature equation of state from yesterday. I'll

155
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,440
just say that the reason these wildfires are so

156
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,570
dense is because the nuclear fusion processes that

157
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:04,370
typically inject heat and energy into stars has

158
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,350
turned off and they have exhausted all of the

159
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,150
elements. So hydrogen, helium is what are fused

160
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,850
together at very high temperatures and pressures

161
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,210
to produce energy from nuclear fusion. But as you

162
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,430
know, hydrogen fuel, hydrogen and helium nuclei

163
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:30,590
fuse together to produce larger nuclei higher up

164
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,710
on the periodic table. Lithium really up to carbon

165
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:39,280
and oxygen. And once that. Nuclear fusion has

166
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,890
ceased all of that heat and the radiation pressure

167
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,990
coming from this nuclear fusion, which formerly

168
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,720
formerly counteracted the gravitational traction

169
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,000
in these stars, has entrances. And the only thing

170
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:01,360
that is left to balance the. The gravitational

171
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,330
attraction that's pulling all of this matter into

172
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,660
smaller and smaller volumes, making the denser,

173
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:13,320
denser. Is exactly that degeneracy pressure coming

174
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,470
from the Pauli exclusion principle rather than any

175
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:23,160
actual forces? And this is. The only source of

176
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,620
pressure left to counteract the gravitational

177
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,130
attraction and keep these white dwarfs from

178
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,520
collapsing into either denser objects and

179
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,030
eventually to black holes, once the. Maternity

180
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:42,250
services shoved into such a small region that. And

181
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,950
that's right, and forms in the framework of

182
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,880
general relativity.

183
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:53,000
So maybe the one. Remarkable aspect of this

184
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,100
physics. Worth commenting on is that. This is the

185
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,450
pressure we derived, this coming from a non

186
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:07,660
attractive ideal gas of quantum fermions and the

187
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,610
fact that we can accurately describe even these

188
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,550
extreme, very dense and very high energy

189
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:20,670
conditions as not interacting particles. Yusoff.

190
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,110
Part of the reason why it is so useful in an

191
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,560
application that the large numbers of particles

192
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,760
and the negative energy scales comparing the

193
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,930
temperature to the Fermi energy conspire to. Allow

194
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,270
even a good description of.

195
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,220
Matter in extreme environments from a fairly

196
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,940
simple physical principles, and here we are helped

197
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,210
by that very large ferme energy from the very high

198
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:59,340
pressure. So apparently energy around. A billion

199
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,390
kelvin.

200
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:06,380
It's crucial to keep the temperatures of these

201
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:12,140
blackhorse low because once that so I should say,

202
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,960
as the as time goes on, the white floors are no

203
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,220
longer burning any fuel in nuclear fusion. But of

204
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,320
course, when they formed, they formed at the end

205
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,120
of that nuclear fusion process. So at the time

206
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,840
when the hydrogen fuel run out, temperatures in

207
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,510
the interior of these Wetmore stars tend to be

208
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,140
about 10 degrees coming from that high temperature

209
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,580
nuclear fusion. And they only gradually cool by

210
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,510
admitting that thermal radiation over the course

211
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,790
of 12, they really have to be cool for trillions

212
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,150
of years until they reach some equilibrium with

213
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,060
the very low temperature, cosmic microwave

214
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,780
background

215
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,270
that has an order of about two Kelvin rather than

216
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:05,860
10 million Kelvin. So we're saved by the very

217
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,790
large Verm energy that allows even temperatures

218
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,920
that if they were in this room, we would consider

219
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,060
to be very high and still be considered very low

220
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,640
and effectively zero temperature to a very good

221
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,450
approximation.

222
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,810
And yes, I have said that. Left on their own,

223
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:30,310
white dwarfs will happily cool for trillions of

224
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,950
years is what it would take for those temperatures,

225
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,150
10 million Kelvin to eventually reach equilibrium.

226
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,200
With the low temperature cosmic microwave

227
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,930
background radiation, which is itself cooling off

228
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,120
as time goes by, it's currently about two point

229
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,220
seven Kelvin and dropping. By the by the day, very

230
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:51,730
slowly.

231
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,020
The way that this connects to supernovas is if we

232
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:02,430
consider a white dwarf star in what's called a

233
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:07,200
binary system where there are two stars orbiting

234
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,410
around each other, at least one of which is the

235
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:15,930
white door. So this is an artist's impression of

236
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,630
the sort of binary system where we have. On the

237
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,580
left. Some companion star to that white dwarf,

238
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,870
which is still burning its nuclear fuel, producing

239
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,310
energy radiation and emitting a steady stream of

240
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:40,320
particles, and by having this very dense. White

241
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,860
dwarf star nearby. The gravitational attraction of

242
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,420
that, that object pulls in all of the matter being

243
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,870
emitted by the companion star, that's gradually

244
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,900
over the course of millions of years and trillions

245
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:01,330
of years, piles up in the white dwarf, increasing

246
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:06,580
its particle number, increasing its density and

247
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,710
increasing its temperature by virtue of.

248
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,860
The larger amount, the larger densify, that's. Is

249
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,200
being brought into play. And a somewhat more

250
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,130
complicated calculation, bringing in relativistic

251
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,650
nuclear physics in addition to the statistical

252
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,870
physics that we are considering.

253
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,670
Identifies the critical density for the star at

254
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:43,060
which new and different types of fusion reactions

255
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,570
can start to occur, and in particular, the carbon

256
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,780
and oxygen that I mentioned earlier, that the

257
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:56,590
fence consists of become able to fuse themselves,

258
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,800
which requires larger density compared to hydrogen

259
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,940
and helium. And this happens when the overall mass

260
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,640
of the white dwarf. Is about 40 percent larger

261
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,790
than the massive or so one point four for about a

262
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,720
few percent uncertainty. This is a value of the

263
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,460
math known as the chandrasekar.

264
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,920
Something drives by to remind you chandrasekar in

265
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,200
the nineteen hundreds and.

266
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:35,110
As soon as the carbon and oxygen in the white talk

267
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:42,540
are able to start fusing and producing lots of. A

268
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,540
new source of thermal radiation and a new source

269
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:52,090
of energy and an increase in the temperature, this

270
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,800
fusion procedes quickly enough that it actually

271
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:00,730
undergoes what's called a runaway reaction. So as

272
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,790
the fusion recedes, the temperature of the white

273
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,540
dwarf is increased faster than its density can

274
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:12,160
adjust, as we would expect from equations, to seem

275
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,250
like the ideal gas law that we end up with a very

276
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,910
dense object and a very high pressure. That, in

277
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,000
turn, encourages more and more fusion, giving more

278
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,890
and more energy until.

279
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,080
A significant fraction of the total mass in the

280
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,250
star million times that of the Earth. It's all

281
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,820
fused into heavier elements, increasing the

282
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,030
temperature. To billions of Kelvyn, rather than

283
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,890
just hundreds or tens of millions and producing

284
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,550
belatedly and increasing the pressure that blasts

285
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:55,490
the white door for cart. Releasing about five

286
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:59,840
million times the energy that the sun that would

287
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,960
release through its hydrogen fusion in a

288
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,090
comparable amount of time.

289
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:12,930
So this is a supernova, a very rapid a very

290
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,160
violent explosion of a star, and it's not the only

291
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,930
type of supernova that's possible.

292
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:26,090
It is an obscure historical reasons known as type

293
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:31,140
one, a supernova. The other types of supernovas

294
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,560
tend to come from larger and heavier stars that

295
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,760
collapse very rapidly as they run out of nuclear

296
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,330
fuel, and that collapse immediately produces a

297
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,550
supernova. The key aspect of these Type 1A

298
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:52,060
supernovas that. Are based on a way to start

299
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,530
acquiring additional matter, additional density

300
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:03,490
from a companion. Is that thanks to relying on the

301
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,540
degeneracy pressure of a low temperature Fairbury

302
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:12,260
gas to. Stabilize the system as it accumulates

303
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,940
that matter, the people in a supernova is always

304
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,260
triggered at a very regular, predictable point,

305
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,270
just as the amount of matter the light accumulates

306
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,140
passes this chandrasekar limit at 40 percent

307
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,610
larger than the mass of our sun. And because this

308
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,160
very specific amount of mass is the trigger for

309
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,930
the supernova. All of the Type 1A supernovas are

310
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:50,020
very similar and independent of. Whatever the mass

311
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,230
or the temperature of the star was at the point

312
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,400
when nuclear fusion ran out of hydrogen and helium

313
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:02,620
fuel. So what this provides is a very regular

314
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,580
process that astronomers can look at what they

315
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:14,080
call a standard candle where by observing how much.

316
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,930
Energy and radiation reach the Earth from a

317
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,350
distance Type 1A supernova, making calibrate

318
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:28,230
precisely how far away it had to be in order for

319
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,700
that amount of energy to reach the earth. Not

320
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:35,730
knowing exactly, exactly the same amount of energy

321
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:40,050
in the same matter was put out at the source of

322
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,160
that supernova. And there was about 20 years ago,

323
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,870
a very large scale worldwide project to map out.

324
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,140
Lots of Type 1A supernovas, various distances away

325
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,580
from the earth, which correspond to the supernova

326
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,430
having occurred many years ago and the like,

327
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,730
taking thousands or millions of years to reach the

328
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,090
earth.

329
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,320
Traveling at the speed of light, so by looking at

330
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,440
supernovas of different distances to get a glimpse

331
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,320
back at the. Behaviour of the universe at

332
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,720
different points of time as a supernovas were

333
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,270
occurring and the light from them was traveling

334
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:30,630
towards us. And the surprising observation of that

335
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:36,610
mapping process was that. The longer go the

336
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:42,130
supernova occurred, the faster it seemed to be

337
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,490
moving away from us or to see things, in other

338
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:50,990
words, the expansion of the universe. Is actually

339
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,680
accelerating, so the universe is expanding more

340
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,550
and more rapidly. As time goes on over the course

341
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,500
of these millions or billions of years. And this

342
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,200
is a phenomenon that we observe without yet

343
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,180
understanding what drives that, we give it a fancy

344
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,030
name called dark energy, which is somewhat

345
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,290
nonsensical. And.

346
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,000
And in the context of general relativity, I'll

347
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,390
just say that this dark energy is terminology that

348
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,210
refers to exactly the accelerating expansion of

349
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:32,220
the universe that was initially revealed by

350
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:36,000
observing these type of supernovas, relying on the

351
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:40,020
regularity thanks to the slow build up of mass

352
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,800
counterbalanced by their degeneracy pressure and

353
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,900
that. Receive the Nobel Prize in physics lab 10

354
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,090
years ago, getting ever closer to the present day

355
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:57,800
and upcoming Nobel Prizes. So any questions about

356
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,060
that application of our equation of states for non

357
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,490
relativistic and gases?

358
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,210
We can move on to

359
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:21,160
someone we consider the different regime going

360
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,580
from the non relativistic, from the obvious to the

361
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,390
relatively large mass compared to particle, its

362
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:32,680
particles, momentum to the relativistic regime.

363
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,780
Which gets us back in somewhat of a full circle to

364
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:41,270
the photon gas that we dealt with last week.

365
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,380
These so the difference now being that we will

366
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,530
consider Marsalis, who effectively Marsalis

367
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:54,220
fermions rather than Krotons where?

368
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,400
We can motivate, considering the relativistic

369
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,790
regime by. Noting that it is.

370
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:11,950
Relevance in nature, even in this context of the

371
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,140
supernova explosions, if we convert to the the

372
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,440
energy of a billion Kelvin we just mentioned for

373
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,310
the light dwarf star into units of. Millions of

374
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:29,490
electron volts. So looking at energies as opposed

375
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,550
to temperatures, just a conversion of units, we

376
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:36,720
see that the electrons in these Whitehorse that

377
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,750
are providing and pressure that stabilizes them. I

378
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,900
have this kinetic energy of about three hundred

379
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,890
thousand electron volts that is comparable to the

380
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:53,060
mass energy of electrons, five hundred eleven

381
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:58,330
thousand electron volts. Which is the regime in

382
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,510
which we can't necessarily neglect militaristic

383
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,640
corrections to the behavior of these particles and

384
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,410
indeed in, say, Carter's calculation, this

385
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,020
relativistic effects were crucial to show that

386
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,540
anything interesting happens around that

387
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,950
Chandrasekhar limit.

388
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:23,090
Unfortunately, the. Intermediate regime between

389
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,780
relativistic ultra relativistic energies is

390
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,660
typically the most complicated, at least

391
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:34,760
enlightening to analyze. We have to. Account for

392
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,430
the effects of relativity. We can't make any

393
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,210
simplifications the way we could for photon gasses,

394
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:48,590
so for purposes we will. Just. Consider the ultra

395
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:53,960
relativistic regime looking at gases of massless

396
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,950
Hermione's that are not completely unpredictable.

397
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,030
These are an excellent approximation to thermionic

398
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,850
particles known as neutrinos. Which.

399
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:14,550
Are also a topic of very active experimental

400
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:19,570
investigation. At prisons in particular, related

401
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:24,660
to the. The masses of neutrinos and the puzzle of

402
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,270
explaining why you treat the masses are so small

403
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:30,630
compared to all the other fermions that we know,

404
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,410
like electrons on neutrino masses, are many orders

405
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:38,220
of magnitude smaller than electron masses or any

406
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,690
others. We don't actually know how small they are.

407
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:45,350
We only have upper bounds. As well as lower bounds,

408
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,350
what the masses of the was can be, but for many

409
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:52,760
years they were thought to be exactly massless.

410
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,440
It's because their voices are so too small to

411
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,460
resolve experimentally, and it was. Just six years

412
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,360
ago now, the twenty fifteen Nobel Prize that was

413
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,160
able to prove that neutrinos have to masses at all

414
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,200
places that lower about. On their possible

415
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,040
Maskell's.

416
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,820
Even though those masses are not zero, they are so

417
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:27,690
small compared to. Any energy's any conceivable

418
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,470
momenta wavelengths that these neutrinos have that

419
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,200
we can treat them as masses, the programs to a

420
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,980
very good approximation and use the same. Approach

421
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,590
the same mathematics as we had for photons, the

422
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:47,120
masses, mohsen's where. The energy and the ultra

423
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,830
relativistic regime is the speed of light times

424
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,870
when these particles, which we can in the same way

425
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:59,990
recast to place in times the angular frequency. Of

426
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,900
these fermions. With the angular frequency

427
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:09,770
themselves are quantized by being defined in some

428
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:14,510
volume cubed that brings in the power of L..

429
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:22,180
Leading the. Allowable frequency Omega to integer

430
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:30,030
vectors. All of which are positive. And. We again

431
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:34,650
have for each of these values of the individual

432
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:40,050
romantic. To each other, energy levels, we are

433
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:46,440
here to. Degeneracy is coming from spin rather

434
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,820
than polarization, so the same factor, too, but a

435
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,270
different physical origin, the same spin as we had

436
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,600
for non relativistic fermions previously.

437
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,220
So we can begin.

438
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,970
Consider a large volume, a large volume else of

439
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,720
the integer case are well approximated by

440
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:17,240
continuous real numbers that is replacing the cube

441
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:23,120
in this momentum space with the sphere. The family

442
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:30,140
surface that we looked at yesterday, people lined

443
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,200
up as a quick reminder.

444
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:40,820
This picture. Correspondence going from the into

445
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:44,670
Zurich approximated those as a continuous real

446
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,000
parameter that we can integrate over rather than

447
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,500
dealing with sums,

448
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,970
and we can also.

449
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,140
Easily create and destroy neutrinos for the same

450
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,510
reason that we can easily create and destroy the

451
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:06,900
photons like those coming from the light. These

452
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:11,570
energies that depend only on the frequency of the

453
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:18,560
neutrinos are. Very small. So a large. A large

454
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,230
number of neutrinos are passing through all of us

455
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,860
every second, and something like a trillion

456
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,640
neutrinos per square inch per second is the flexin

457
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,040
between us passing through Boston through the

458
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,400
Earth.

459
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,340
So a huge number that is easy to change is that

460
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:43,920
change the energy, which is. What corresponds to a

461
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,440
small or approximately vanishing chemical

462
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,570
potential with that? Change in the number of

463
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,230
particles does not significantly change the

464
00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:02,840
overall energy of the system. So the grand

465
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,370
economic potential that we end up with compared to

466
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:12,620
the full time economic potential that we saw last

467
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,310
week, are two different two changes, the negative

468
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:20,330
side both coming from the starting point of very

469
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,330
direct statistics as opposed to sticks. And if you

470
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,100
are to look back through your notes to that

471
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,640
equation before you'll see it does not have an

472
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,310
overall negative sign out front, but it does have

473
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:38,120
a relative negative sign, which is the argument of

474
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,180
this likability factor. One liners, an exponential

475
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:47,750
rather than one, plus the exponential. So we have

476
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:53,450
plenty of time to do through the calculation of

477
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,970
the internal energy and average particle number

478
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,290
based on.

479
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,340
This economic potential for massive photomontages,

480
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,030
just label with that Greek letter, new for

481
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:11,970
Neutrino, where we recall the setup of great

482
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:15,300
potential from now a few weeks ago, the internal

483
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,500
energy is just given by the derivative with

484
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,550
respect to the infrastructure data of that

485
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:26,940
infrastructure times, economic potential. And for

486
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,860
the average particle, no, we have the negative

487
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,040
derivative with respect to potential of the

488
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,640
economic potential. And then at the end of taking

489
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,360
that derivative, we need to set the capital

490
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:42,370
attention to zero. Which has already been done in

491
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,220
equation one of the six. We just have that

492
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:49,150
exponential of each Farmigo negativity rather than

493
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:53,540
the additional factor of either the new Oberti.

494
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:59,470
That we're coming for you, so you might as well

495
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:07,360
just go ahead and do those computations where the.

496
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,490
Derivative.

497
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,060
Of the the function, the detail with respect to

498
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,850
data is going to first with the argument of that

499
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:27,260
law into the denominator. And then go through with

500
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,870
the chain rule, derivative of that exponential

501
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:34,310
factor with respect to data is indicative of each

502
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:38,990
farmiga the exponential factor itself and then we

503
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:43,040
have. The overall factor of Omega squared coming

504
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,620
along. And we can just combine the third of mega.

505
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,350
From.

506
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,740
Combined with the additional power from the

507
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,790
derivative of the exponential factor and change

508
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:06,660
variables as we have for. Tax equal to our mega.

509
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,290
For each part of routine, so that this moment

510
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:18,810
dealmaker wielded by the ratio T over H bar to X

511
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,570
or X, so.

512
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,800
Collecting these constants, the negative signs

513
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,100
cancel out each bar over, see huge piles squared,

514
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:37,860
and then. People in factories of T divided by far

515
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:43,300
from. I'll make a cube and from the deal by so in

516
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:47,860
total, four of those factors, the limits of

517
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:51,070
integration remain the same through this direct

518
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:57,500
relation between variable X and if we. Multiply

519
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,340
through by the plus data HRO, they could divide it

520
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:06,620
by. Plus each Farmigo multiplied by one, we end up

521
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:14,870
with one over one, but rather X cubed over the

522
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,860
positive X.

523
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:25,400
Plus one. Which is one of those fun, no integrals

524
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,020
that depends on the remains of function and the

525
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,800
gamma function and the particular now that we have

526
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,480
a relative positive time in the denominator of

527
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,620
these integrals. All that does is bring in a

528
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:48,880
numerical factor. It depends on the power to which

529
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,930
this integration variable X is raised numerator a

530
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,680
factor of one minus one over to raise of that

531
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,000
power. So in this case of executed, we have one

532
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,540
minus one over to Cube, which is one minus an

533
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:09,030
eight, which is seven eighths. Again, before it is

534
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,630
three factorial, which is six. So six times seven

535
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,710
eighths is.

536
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,360
Seven times three over four, and then we remind

537
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,200
theater function.

538
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,380
For.

539
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,940
Argument for

540
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:39,210
is it the fourth over 90, so 90 multiplied by four

541
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,160
thirds gives us 120 overall factor of seven fourth

542
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,380
that we can then plug into the computation

543
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:51,740
underway. To find.

544
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,020
That overall seven, we have two factors of pie

545
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,750
after canceling out with the two in the

546
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,810
denominator, we have T to the power four and then

547
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:10,970
that one hundred twenty each cubed, C cubed. So

548
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:11,420
again,

549
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:17,420
finding the same sort of functional dependence of

550
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,660
the energy density that we had for the photon gas

551
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:26,890
where. The. Energy of these this gas of masses

552
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:31,780
neutrinos depends on the volume times temperature

553
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,070
to the power for.

554
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,710
And if we proceed. The similar substitution in the.

555
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,640
Average particle, no density. We're now taking the

556
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,680
same sort of derivative, restoring this factor of.

557
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,410
E to the. New over tea and then setting up

558
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:01,640
potential value equal to zero at the end, so.

559
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,690
Churning through this change of variables more

560
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,810
quickly, we will pick up.

561
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,160
Only two powers of tea over power from the two

562
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,300
factors of Omega squared, plus a third factor from

563
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,540
the Omega, the derivative itself is bringing down

564
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:32,960
a factor of beta, which is the inverse temperature,

565
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,640
and will eventually cancel out with that out front.

566
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:41,390
So we can cancel that out and be left with just T

567
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:46,220
over H cubed times. But it's almost that same

568
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:52,800
integral. Just now, X squared the X plus one T X.

569
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:59,190
Which follows the same pattern as we had for

570
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,210
the integral executed over the X plus one, we now

571
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:09,630
have one minus one or two squared is one minus a

572
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:13,470
quarter, three quarters times Gamma three, which

573
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:17,220
is two factorial or two. So three quarters times

574
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,970
two is three 1/2 times this irrational factor, say

575
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:28,400
three of the Roman Zeta function. So. Collecting

576
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,550
all that gives us.

577
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:50,430
Rehabs. There it is, so free. Zeta three T cubed

578
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:59,810
over two pi squared each four cubed C cube stone

579
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:04,200
also. As for the case of the photon, yes, the

580
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:09,660
particle number is one powered down in temperature

581
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,890
compared to the energy. In other words, that

582
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:17,100
energy of the neutrino gas is proportional to

583
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:23,300
the particle number times temperature, both of

584
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,340
which are then personal to buoyant times.

585
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,600
Temperature to the fourth.

586
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:37,970
And you can even. Plug in a note here, what that

587
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:42,980
constant of proportionality is where.

588
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,730
I have enough room up at the top of the page, all

589
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:54,630
fit on the screen at the same time. Right.

590
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,230
This

591
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:06,630
energy as the between a number of times we need to

592
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,950
end up with. Seven PI squared times over 120.

593
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:20,790
The factors of heart and see are the same and both

594
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:23,340
of the energy density and particle numbers, so

595
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,550
they are accounted for. We just need to cancel out

596
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:30,690
the remaining factors in the particle numbers. So

597
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:37,130
to. PI squared over three, Zyda three. So the

598
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:41,240
overall factor to consider proportionality in this

599
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,980
expression is going to be

600
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:52,190
seven pi to the four. Divided by one 20 over to 60

601
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,180
times, three is one.

602
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:58,980
Times have Monday, the function of three and then

603
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,130
the number times temperature.

604
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,790
The last step to the equation of fate for this gas

605
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:14,270
of Marcellus fermions, which looks like a good

606
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:21,150
place to. Lined up for today is to impose the

607
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,810
condition of chaos and entropy so that we can take

608
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:30,960
the. Derivative of the energy with respect to the

609
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,090
negative volume.

610
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,420
And just as for. The photon us.

611
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,100
Recalling that the energy is. One over temperature

612
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,370
times, the difference between the internal energy

613
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,640
and the. Free energy, Europe, the great economic

614
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:53,370
potential.

615
00:44:55,430 --> 00:45:02,680
We again have an integral over X. Of each Farmigo.

616
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,840
A change of variables that brings in three powers

617
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:12,550
of T divided by far from the three factors of X

618
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:16,960
outside of the logarithm. That integral over the

619
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,210
logarithm is yet another. Factor that depends on

620
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:28,610
the remote Zeta function turns out to be something

621
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:34,890
like. Seven to the fourth, over three sixty, which

622
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,510
is seven quarters times.

623
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,740
Zeta for.

624
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,650
But we don't actually care about what that value

625
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:50,640
is, only the functional dependence proportional to

626
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:56,660
volume times T cubed is relevant. Because when we

627
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:05,620
plug that in to. This derivative. We have from the

628
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:10,390
for the energy, there is seven pipes squared to

629
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:16,470
the four. Over 120. Each part you see, Kud.

630
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:26,030
And imposing this constant neutrino entropy.

631
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:35,120
Tells us to fix T equal to some constant times the

632
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:40,550
inverse cube root of the volume. So for powers of

633
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,840
B to the minus, a third gives us V to the minus

634
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,590
four thirds multiplied by T to the plus one leaves.

635
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:51,920
Overall.

636
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,390
B to the minus one third.

637
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,510
So derivative with respect to be of some comfort,

638
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:07,100
to be for to minus the 30 counts, for the constant

639
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:10,260
entropy condition, so that derivative just brings

640
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,590
down a factor of minus the third cancels the

641
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,820
negative sign. You bring down an extra factor of B

642
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:23,190
that we can pull out front and just have all of

643
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:28,690
the house factors coming along. For the ride here

644
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:34,670
to be to the fourth from the city to the fourth to

645
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,550
the remaining B to the minus third, which is then

646
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:45,190
just one third of the energy of the neutrino gas

647
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:50,500
divided by volume or rearranging we have.

648
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,740
Equation states for Marcellus. Fermions that

649
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:01,570
follows the now familiar. Functional form of the

650
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,560
ideal gas law pressure times volume is one

651
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:11,890
thousand times the average internal energy related

652
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:15,220
that average internal energy to the neutrino

653
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,580
particle number at the top of the page. So three

654
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,510
times when he is five hundred forty five, the

655
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:26,590
factor of seven out of the four over Zyda, three

656
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:31,840
coming along. To give us, again, a different

657
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:35,800
numerical factor compared to both the classical.

658
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:41,570
Ideal gas law equals energy, as well as the

659
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:47,630
equation of state for the photon gas, where we had

660
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:53,870
the factor of PI for over 90 days in the three.

661
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:59,830
That was the ratio of Zyda of four over the three,

662
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:04,660
we have that same ratio of Zeta functions just

663
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:09,010
with an additional seven eighths over three

664
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:14,760
quarters, which boils down to seven six four

665
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:19,690
overstated. Three said yesterday that this ratio

666
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:23,980
was about four point nine. So multiply that by

667
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:27,220
seven. Six gives us another factor, very close to

668
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:33,060
one. So just a few percent deviation from the

669
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:37,080
classical ideal gas law for this gas is Marcellus

670
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:44,480
fermions. And that is that at least was the end of

671
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:47,660
the day, which is why I pushed to get through the

672
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:51,290
end with our immediate questions, we can take them

673
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:55,040
quickly before next class tries to get in here. I

674
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:02,660
see that we are just at the end of time and. And

675
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,900
not seeing any real pick up on Friday was just a

676
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:10,430
bit of additional detail about how to accommodate

677
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,080
a low but nonzero temperature in that non

678
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,780
relativistic from Yungas going beyond the

679
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,900
approximation of the FERME function is a step

680
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:29,020
function. So see you back for that. To wrap up the

681
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:35,680
part of first part of this term. Take. The rest of

682
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,160
you there.
