1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,280
All right, let's get this in focus just in time to begin.

2
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,380
That's better.

3
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:42,360
And we'll start off today with the usual six digit

4
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,180
number for you all

5
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,390
It is eight eight two seven

6
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,090
five three

7
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,430
Now we can get another week under way in Statistical

8
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,940
Physics.  Welcome back, to the official start of

9
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,950
spring. And are there any questions lingering

10
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,950
from what we were doing last week with quantum

11
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:17,170
statistics building up now to the culmination of

12
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:24,520
this section of the module, which can briefly

13
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,320
recap to get reoriented going into this new week.

14
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:34,990
So it's the twenty-first of March,

15
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,780
and as has been the case for a little while, we've

16
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:50,620
been building up to analyses of quantum gases.

17
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,050
Based on the one hand.

18
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,310
Ukraine canonical example, the. Third of the main

19
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,570
sophistical ensembles. Considered by this module,

20
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,990
which allows both energy and particle number to

21
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,600
fluctuate, affixing temperature to the potential.

22
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:21,060
And along with the approach crime statistics,

23
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,970
which differs from classical statistics by, as we

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,810
saw last week, something over screen energy levels.

25
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,200
Considering all the possible occupation numbers

26
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,000
for those emerging models rather than. Consider

27
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,610
individual particles in the something over all the

28
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,670
ways that they could be arranged and trying to

29
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,190
correct for overcounting in the case of

30
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,170
indistinguishable particles, and we wrapped up the

31
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,690
last aspect of quantum statistics last week by

32
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,070
looking at the Bose Einstein.

33
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,620
Statistics of. Those arms particles that can have

34
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,760
those legs.

35
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,770
Statistics of particles that can have any negative

36
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,190
occupation number, the energy level, and compare

37
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:25,160
that to. The family director. Statistics of

38
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,770
fermions, which can have at most one fairness in

39
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,220
an individual energy level and saw that in both

40
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,000
cases.

41
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,310
In the high temperature limit with a large

42
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,660
negative chemical potential.

43
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,970
Your predictions for both those aren't named

44
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,800
formulas approached. The maximum Boltzmann

45
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,760
statistics

46
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:03,850
that we derived through the classical approach

47
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,850
that was for attention much larger than the high

48
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,240
temperature that was in turn larger than the

49
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,360
relevant energy levels. It doesn't quite all fit.

50
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,690
On that screen there, but.

51
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,240
Are there any questions about the crime statistics

52
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,170
stuff that we wrapped up last week as the shaking

53
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:37,290
heads, so I'll just move straight into the quantum

54
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,770
gasses that we took a few minutes to look at on

55
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,000
Friday, reviewing the quantization of energy

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,370
levels that occur when we place these gases in a

57
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,720
finite volume. Both sides, though, Kud.

58
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,630
Determines the possible momentum and in terms of

59
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:09,890
the possible energies for ideal gases in. Such a

60
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,360
finite I'm that to depend inversely on the size.

61
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,820
Of these containers believe that the gases

62
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,230
formulated in the first change that we saw looking

63
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,250
back over this case now relativistic, massive

64
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,800
bosun's in this cubic volume was an adjustment to

65
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,440
our onsides for these types of energy levels.

66
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,580
Based on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that's

67
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,870
ruled out the possibility of negative or zero

68
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,230
energy states for any particle in this case,

69
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,990
knowing that the particles are confined to a

70
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:01,190
finite region requires in turn a non-zero momentum

71
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,550
and zero energy in order to satisfy the

72
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,290
constraints on the precision with which the

73
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,510
position and momentum of each particle can

74
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:19,730
simultaneously be defined and. Restricting the.

75
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,880
Possible injuries appear in the momentum and in

76
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,510
turn the energy use came, like he's said, to be

77
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,850
strictly positive rather than negative. Also, Mr.

78
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,620
Riquelme, Friday, we saw this ultras, the

79
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,370
DeGeneres's, with which different energy levels

80
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:49,040
are realized, depending on permutations of these

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,550
possible, until they rush through a bit just at

82
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:55,990
the end.

83
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,520
You could just add a little note here that I think

84
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:09,100
the political responding to this trip generates a

85
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,130
whole set of energy levels with the. Next to a

86
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,130
minimum possible interview for. A single particle

87
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,600
for all possible combinations of. Permutations.

88
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,280
Of the. Where is the. Merger momentum can be

89
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,660
oriented in. The directions, X, Y and Z.

90
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:44,380
So all of that was, at least in part, a review and

91
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,010
a slight adjustment of what we did with classical

92
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,940
ideal dresses back in Unit four in the framework

93
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,800
of the canonical ensemble. And that would make

94
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,660
things a bit more interesting and brand new for

95
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,130
today

96
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,430
by specializing to a certain type of particles

97
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,980
known as photons, which are particles of light.

98
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,790
And while many of these lecture notes over the

99
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,510
past week, I realized that there is a significant

100
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,790
amount of capital without photons and relativity

101
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:27,140
and electromagnetism being brought into play in

102
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,480
formulating these ideal gases of photons, not

103
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,650
interacting particles. So I will try to be clear

104
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:42,490
about. Some justification for some aspects of that

105
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,320
information, as well as setting Selamat. Details

106
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,080
aside, that we don't need for the purpose of

107
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,670
statistical physics.

108
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:59,470
So maybe the key feature of photons that

109
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,520
distinguishes them from the classical idea of

110
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,270
gases we consider previously are that these

111
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:11,170
particles of light are exactly massless. And

112
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:16,240
correspondingly, travel at the speed of light. Now,

113
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,520
what we have to do for the purpose of quantum

114
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,010
statistics is specify the energy levels that are

115
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:31,050
possible for a system of photons. The volume of

116
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:36,080
size vehicles cube, and it should be fair to see

117
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,010
that for a system of massless particles equal to

118
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,880
zero, the energies that we were working with in

119
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,270
that non relativistic case back in uniform in the

120
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,430
brief review on Friday are not well-defined. Those

121
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,930
who have energy or momentum squared divided by

122
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,100
twice the mass dividing by zero is nobody's idea

123
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,810
of a good time. So just as a result that we can

124
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,330
take as input and say that the room accepts that

125
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:14,020
the energy of a photon is. No longer is momentum

126
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,890
squared, divided by twice as mass, but rather just

127
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,550
proportional to the magnitude of its momentum. So

128
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,950
that is the square root of the sum of squares. The

129
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,800
magnitude in each of the three spatial directions,

130
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:36,750
X, Y and Z defines that. Magnitude and the.

131
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,200
Consider proportionality that relates the photon

132
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,050
energy and its momentum P. Is traditionally.

133
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,030
Cold sea, and it corresponds exactly to the speed

134
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,780
of light and really the speed of light is doing

135
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,250
here is just converting units between matter and

136
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,150
energy. So if we were to work in a sensible set of

137
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,730
units where management energy had the same

138
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,730
dimensions, that speed of light could just be set

139
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,830
to one, the same way that we have done with the

140
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:20,990
Boltzmann constant violates. Temperature and in

141
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,780
units of energy. And

142
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:35,310
I'll say just a bit about how this expression for

143
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,060
the the of energy can both be easily remembered

144
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,910
and also connected to the non relativistic

145
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,360
particles that we considered earlier, which.

146
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,010
Are related through your general expression from

147
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,030
special relativity, though, how many of you have

148
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,000
seen that relativity? And if so, what detail does

149
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,630
that you have? Might recall that the energy

150
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,920
squared. For example, is a combination of two

151
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,790
factors first, being squared of the squared and

152
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,610
the second being this momentum times the speed of

153
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,240
light of squared relation that is sometimes called

154
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,680
Einstein's triangle. Just because it has the same

155
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,810
form as the Pythagorean relation, if we have a

156
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:33,510
triangle with a square on one side, the right

157
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:39,540
angle and on the other, then the magnitude of its

158
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,360
hypotenuse is squared is equal to the sum of them

159
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,940
squared, squared, plus the square now would be

160
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,810
massive zero as we have here. This just boils down

161
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,860
to an energy equal dependency, which also holds in

162
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,730
the ultra relativistic regime where masses are

163
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,560
very small compared to momentum.

164
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,280
And in the case, the stationary particles from the

165
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,370
momentum is zero. All that's left of this relation

166
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,900
is the famous Masamichi Square. And we can also.

167
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,080
And divide the number of units, kinetic energy

168
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,440
that we had on the previous page, just from

169
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,700
considering the limit where the math is large

170
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,860
compared to the momentum in the units, or if we

171
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,470
take the square root of this relation about the

172
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,410
overall factor of the large. Amnesty Square, then

173
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,250
what's left is the square root of one plus.

174
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,710
Squared, C, squared off over. It was clear to see

175
00:13:53,710 --> 00:14:00,100
that before if we expand that square roots in the

176
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:07,170
Taylor series. Times Square, times one plus P

177
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:13,360
squared over two. And squared, C squared plus

178
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:19,100
order went up to the fourth and the fourth with

179
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,770
the conversion factor. And then spending.

180
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,660
Multiplication there just leaves us with the

181
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,140
massive energy up front and C squared for the

182
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:39,400
stationary particle in a P squared over two times,

183
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,920
them over M squared is more powerful than the sea

184
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,710
squirts cancel out and there are higher order

185
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:53,490
corrections or people of the for cubed squared. So

186
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,270
it does. Here is this large mass energy was larger

187
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:03,080
than the events and the next correction is exactly

188
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,760
the number was a mystic kinetic energy that we

189
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,240
were working with in Unit four and we've been

190
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:19,820
moving on Friday. Now. That is just a simple way

191
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,120
to remember the connection between these

192
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,270
novelistic regimes.

193
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,980
The trial's not going to focus on the case of

194
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:40,240
massive where the energy is. Just the momentum

195
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:46,990
times and to continue specifying the energy levels

196
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,720
for photons of gas, and we need to take note of

197
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,940
the DeGeneres's of all these energy levels, which.

198
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,160
Something that I will just state and set aside for

199
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,570
each momentum that leads to the same. Energy is a

200
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,790
function of the magnitude of the momentum there

201
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,650
are to generate energy levels with what are called

202
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:21,040
different polarizations. This is coming from the.

203
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,120
Relation between the photos as quantization and

204
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,830
propagated electric fields. Or we don't have to be

205
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,120
that fancy and talk about privatization, but just

206
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,370
call that electromagnetism describes the

207
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,040
propagation of light and in fact the whole

208
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:45,900
electromagnetic spectrum, which can be polarized

209
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,060
in two different ways. If there is interest in

210
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,170
seeing details about that polarization that can go

211
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,400
into it, say a tutorial. But for the statistical

212
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,200
physics that we're interested in, you can just

213
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,790
take the double degeneracy of all energy levels

214
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:08,010
for photons as inputs. And this is an additional

215
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,820
degeneracy that multiplies all once we went

216
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:17,160
through the gate on Friday related to the possible

217
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,010
permutations of the orientation of these momenta.

218
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:24,790
So with.

219
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,090
The sort of generalities all touched upon, you can

220
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:38,010
go ahead and specialize to the same volume that we

221
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,950
had before, which leads to the same discrete

222
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,370
momentum for the particles in that plane with a

223
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:50,730
strictly positive set of integer, X, Y and Z. And

224
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,460
the corresponding energy is now. Are just a factor

225
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,180
of the speed of light see times those

226
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,960
corresponding with same before flying in each bar

227
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,080
and the ratio of high overhead all times the

228
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,760
magnitude of these integer tables, we can write

229
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,320
just as K with no decoration.

230
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,260
So the expression we have for. The energy of a

231
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,040
photon with a given set a moment to specify by

232
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,770
these integers, hey, is this past the time

233
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,570
somebody Shilpi over 11 times that killed in a

234
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:40,020
volume of size cubed? Which is something we could

235
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,010
certainly work with, but it's more convenient to.

236
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,800
Besides this event and put it in form in the form

237
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,150
of the wavelength of photons and their

238
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:58,090
corresponding angular frequency, which. Is too

239
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,360
high at times. It's called the cyclic frequency of

240
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,530
essentially the cyclic frequency measures, the

241
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:12,830
amount of cycles that. The electromagnetic waves

242
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,900
cycles through per second and the factor of two PI

243
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,480
is just a conversion factor, changing that in

244
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:25,190
seconds, two units of radians per second. And this

245
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:31,880
Omega here for the frequency. Of this. Foot tidal

246
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,800
wave is. A possible source of confusion with

247
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:41,490
microstates to try to. Distinguish. And for any

248
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,650
wave that's propagating the. Wavelength and the

249
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:52,160
frequency of that wave are. Together determine the

250
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,620
speed of that propagation, which in the case of

251
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,580
photons is just the speed of light. So the product

252
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,420
of wavelength times frequency is telling us how.

253
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:10,150
How many cycles the wave cycles about space, the

254
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,690
second wave length inverse, that number of cycles

255
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,670
to the length of the cycles, getting to the final

256
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:22,860
form of length per unit of time or speed.

257
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,120
And.

258
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,550
Thanks to. The relation between particles of metal

259
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,940
and wavelengths introduced by the Detroit. Which

260
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,580
we touched on earlier in this course of.

261
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,540
Having. Can find our first home guests to this boy,

262
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:54,720
you. Size allocute, we require that both the

263
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,530
momentum and the wavelengths are quite as

264
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,730
prevalent as we've already seen several times.

265
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,380
Depending on this ratio of Purell and the wave

266
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,830
subject to the constraints that. And even number,

267
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,410
a integer number of half of what it's made up of

268
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:25,090
or two must fit in this volume, which is probably

269
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,290
easiest to recall based on this visual

270
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:34,200
representation down here where the wavelength is

271
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:39,540
the distance for the wave to cycle both up and

272
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,180
down to the back around to its regular starting

273
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:48,530
point. So this one here is a complete wavelength

274
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,680
we need in order to have a standing wave that does

275
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,470
not destructively interfere with itself.

276
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,240
There must be an integer number of half

277
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,410
wavelengths so that. Nodes can be fixed to the

278
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:12,330
boundaries of this volume, so the longest possible

279
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:17,130
wavelength that can be contained in this volume of

280
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,630
size altitude is precisely the wavelength of twice.

281
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,880
That bill twice the size of the school year,

282
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:32,090
corresponding to K of one in this relation between.

283
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,010
The size of the container and possibly finds that

284
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,920
it can contain.

285
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,810
Swapping out the white flag over to that appears

286
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,560
the definition of the speed of light with this

287
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,190
quantization condition. We find that the speed of

288
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:58,060
light. This is the product of the frequency of the

289
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:04,990
sometimes. Time's all over this, not over this

290
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,750
positive with your career, if I hide it, we can

291
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:15,710
reorganize. To isolate this factor of higher

292
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,780
timescale, which is suggested because we just had

293
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,710
an equation 90 to exactly the height of the

294
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,760
Alzheimer's. Multiplied by the speed of light, see,

295
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,400
multiplied by each four identified has the energy.

296
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:37,950
So. This. Quantization of the possible wavelengths.

297
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:44,730
In turn, quantize as possible frequency's. Baker

298
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:53,530
is C times PI, 12 times is energetic. So equation

299
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,910
number two boils down to the simple expression

300
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,520
that the energy is each part of Jamaica. So as I

301
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,680
walked to the side, a lot of details about photons

302
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:12,390
coming into the construction of the end, a very

303
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,440
simple expression for the photon energy. That the

304
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,260
energy is a function of frequency is just about

305
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,190
four times that frequency with the frequencies

306
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,270
quantized by which you are working in. This is the

307
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,470
usual container with a volume of allocute solution.

308
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:41,220
Pause there to see if there are any questions

309
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:46,200
about all of the photos and details I went through

310
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,040
fairly quickly and in some cases set aside. Four

311
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,600
separate discussions or just to take his input.

312
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,810
It looks like we're happy to accept this result

313
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:12,150
for the energy levels of photons. There's just one

314
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,930
quick visualization, beautiful illustration to

315
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,780
highlight one aspect of this which may or may not

316
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:23,020
be familiar, that's. Is to see.

317
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,730
By plugging in the inverse relation between

318
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,130
wavelength, the frequency by the speed of light,

319
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,880
that the energies of photons are inversely

320
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,160
proportional to their wavelengths. So when we have

321
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,990
George Wavelets. We have.

322
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:51,100
Small energy is. And low frequencies available,

323
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,670
which is known as. The infrared regime, infrared

324
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:00,890
being a fancy way of saying less than the red side

325
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,340
of the visual spectrum of electromagnetic

326
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,670
radiation. And similarly, when we have high

327
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,030
frequencies, that corresponds to short wavelengths.

328
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,080
And high energies that are known as ultraviolet or

329
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,550
higher energies than the violent side of the

330
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,340
visual spectrum. This.

331
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,940
Picture here. We'll just flesh out as a bit of

332
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,440
illustration of this relationship and show the

333
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,000
full spectrum of electromagnetic radiation of

334
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:50,150
photons organized by. That wavelength and

335
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:56,240
equivalently the corresponding energy, so. You

336
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,340
talked about things in terms of infrared,

337
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:03,050
ultraviolet, setting them around the visible

338
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:06,710
spectrum wavelengths of several hundred nanometres

339
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,990
where higher energies or shorter wavelengths are

340
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,850
the violet side of the visible color spectrum, and

341
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,030
the lower energies have longer wavelengths, part

342
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:25,150
of the red side of the spectrum. At the infrared,

343
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,020
we get to longer wavelengths, 10 micrometers.

344
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,420
And going on for the two larger length scales.

345
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:42,890
Order. Centimeters in the case of microwaves that

346
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:48,380
can be used to heat up food and then even tens or

347
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,770
hundreds of thousands of liters of radiowaves,

348
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,760
very low frequency and wavelength, low energy

349
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:01,070
photons in the other direction takes us to the

350
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,120
ultraviolet wavelengths, shorter than high energy,

351
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,910
violent side of the visible spectrum, eventually

352
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,980
going out to x rays and gamma rays. That probe

353
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,910
site sizes down to the molecular atomic nuclear

354
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:21,380
scales that correspond to higher energies and

355
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,660
higher temperatures, we'll see.

356
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,200
Through that inverse relation between wavelength

357
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,700
and energy.

358
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,550
So that is what's the background about what

359
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:44,280
happens your. To plug in what we've taken away

360
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,080
into the grand canonical example, the frame of the

361
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:54,510
problems is so. As we arrived last week for close

362
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,110
to six, we consider the helpless one energy levels

363
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,280
one at a time in the form of the great medical

364
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,750
potentials. This is. The negative temperature

365
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:10,040
times, the logarithm of the protection function in

366
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,100
the criminal courts are the fundamental starting

367
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,760
point for analysis. And in the case of those

368
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,290
outside statistics, we derived this form of some

369
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:25,500
of the lowest energy levels of the logarithm. But

370
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,010
the quantity, one minus and visual exponential

371
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:31,800
factor, the energy value minus, the chemical

372
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,970
detection by the body temperature with the

373
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,660
constraints.

374
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:44,510
The. Chemical potential must be blessed in any

375
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,780
given energy level in order for the geometric

376
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:53,890
series. Defining those statistics to converge and

377
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,360
give us know the final results, so putting in the

378
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,370
fact that the photon energy is dependent only on

379
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:07,090
the momentum enabled by this trick, you can

380
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:10,420
believe the sum of our energy levels to a sum over

381
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:16,330
all the possible vectors of X, Y and Z with the

382
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:20,110
overall factor of two polarizations states

383
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,060
mentioned.

384
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,750
It's about.

385
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:32,240
It's the double degeneracy of all energy levels,

386
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,250
in addition to the permutations of the incremental

387
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:42,130
direction. In what we can do to simplify this

388
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,760
expression in the case of photons is actually

389
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,480
approximate that chemical potential. As zero based

390
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,110
on the.

391
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,510
The fact that we can appreciate that photons are

392
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,470
relatively easy to create and destroy, that is to

393
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:07,890
say that in a very wide array of physical

394
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:13,680
circumstances, we can change the number of photons

395
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,480
without changing the energy. Of the corresponding

396
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,530
statistical system to an appreciable extent. So

397
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,560
all the lights in this room, for instance, are

398
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:30,680
blasting out a huge number of photons every second,

399
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,450
every unit of time for us to be able to dust off

400
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:40,260
each other and see what's going on. And similarly,

401
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,230
if we heat up food or drink in a microwave oven,

402
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:47,250
there are a vast number of lower energy photons

403
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:52,890
with longer wavelengths in the microwave regime of

404
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,910
centimeters and tens of centimeters. That's.

405
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:04,070
Involve an enormous number of photons without too

406
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,770
much change in the energy, so plugging that

407
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,930
physical argumentation into the expression we

408
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,820
derived. For the chemical potential on the basis

409
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:22,030
of the generalized identity at the end of Unit six,

410
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:26,410
you see that even when the change in the number of

411
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,680
photons is very large, change of the energy is

412
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,450
very small. So the overall chemical potential must

413
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:36,340
itself be very small. It can be ballpark's by zero

414
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,920
to great economic potential. That almost looks

415
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,030
like something you might have seen in the

416
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:49,450
framework of the war with no reference to the

417
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,300
chemical potential. But we still do have to

418
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:57,610
remember that the number of photons is going to be

419
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,600
fluctuating in all of these gases. And indeed, the

420
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,090
vanishing chemical Wythenshawe essentially means

421
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:07,510
there's no restriction on the possible

422
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:12,040
fluctuations and you can take any conceivable

423
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,590
value without penalty.

424
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:22,470
And. Just to be safe, we can check that with the

425
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,370
Spanish mechanical potential, we still satisfy the

426
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:33,220
condition. For. The convergence of both sides

427
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:38,960
expects to work in a finite volume that requires a

428
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,290
non-zero value of the momentum and therefore

429
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,420
non-zero value of the photon energy

430
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,500
disproportional to that momentum. So the strictly

431
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,940
positive energies remain larger than the vanishing

432
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,630
chemical potential, and those statistics is well

433
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,110
defined for the spokeswoman's.

434
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,340
What we can do to further simplify this sum over

435
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:12,430
all the possible energy levels labeled by these.

436
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,980
Integer vectors proportional to the momentum is to.

437
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,010
Again, motivated by physical situations, think

438
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:27,750
about photons in a boy that is very large compared

439
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:32,400
to the photon wavelength. So that the energies

440
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,150
that depend on one else coming from this volume

441
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,910
are all very closely together and this discrete,

442
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,760
some over it is your chance to win in kids that

443
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:51,620
can be approximated by. Integration. Over

444
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,480
continuous legal parameters, Jon Karl Capehart and

445
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:01,490
about to run from this very small number one over

446
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:09,240
L up to infinity. There is a. Negligible error

447
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:13,410
introduced by extending those approvals from one

448
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:20,450
of the way down to zero. Look at these three

449
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,310
spatial directions so we can go ahead and do that

450
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,190
and then convert to Sterkel Point. That's.

451
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:36,140
Which is. Profitable to do, because we have seen

452
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,170
the full time energy dependence only of the

453
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,560
magnitude of this three reactor. So all of the

454
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,520
angular information coming from the different.

455
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,300
Directions that explain why kids that can be

456
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,960
oriented can just be pulled out into account, the

457
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:58,040
factor that turns out to be because the factor of

458
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,410
Hiromitsu in the.

459
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,310
Is a visual way of identifying this cost factor of

460
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:12,860
pilots who used to picture the three dimensional

461
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:17,720
space of these white kids and think about the

462
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:22,220
portion of that space that is highlighted by

463
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:28,530
requiring. Positive values for those three

464
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,820
directions.

465
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,780
No attempts to do that three dimensional drawing

466
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,290
on the board.

467
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,800
Or another other words, real.

468
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:57,220
Finding ourselves two positive tests, positive and

469
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,140
positive, said, picking out just.

470
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,520
Think of the full year.

471
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,320
Almost

472
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,220
half of. The greater than zero, they'd like to

473
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,900
have less than zero. Similarly.

474
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,730
By values that are greater than zero, neglecting

475
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,320
those that are less than zero and finally

476
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,960
executing their values that are greater than zero.

477
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:41,800
Rather than.

478
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,380
They're going to listen to your side. Put that

479
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,570
down in the. Lefthanded court system, but it

480
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,220
doesn't matter.

481
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,420
With about one eighth of the total salad angle of

482
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,170
this sphere, we do these angular derivatives from

483
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:05,850
zero to by halves rather than all the way around.

484
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:13,470
Zero to pi, those ultra angular directions ending

485
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:18,770
up with. Just this single integral over the

486
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:24,140
squared. Legal parameter, perhaps going from zero

487
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:28,970
to infinity, the time over two multiplied by two

488
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,630
you in the Grand Canal. The potential leaves us

489
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:37,530
with. Pilots times to prefecture on this integral.

490
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,820
And then the general log of one minus the

491
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,730
exponential with minus energy temperature. Coming

492
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:50,330
from those same statistics with the initial

493
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:54,730
chemical potential. We can now just plug in the

494
00:38:54,730 --> 00:39:00,860
photon energy that we. Derived earlier today and.

495
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,280
Change variables from the continuous OK, that is

496
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,340
proportional to this frequency or the absolute

497
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,980
proportionality coming from the speed of light.

498
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:20,660
To find the finish line before the starting point

499
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:28,170
for. Statistical analysis. What we have instead of

500
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:32,310
these three factors, of course, had three factors

501
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,100
of the frequency of Bego that.

502
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,930
Brings in. Three hours of Ellenwood over the speed

503
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,140
of light see times it pulled up in front of the

504
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,700
integral.

505
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,110
And simplify to identify that altitude as the

506
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:58,040
volume of the container gases and multiply by the

507
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,040
temperature divided by three towers at the speed

508
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,690
of light, two powers of high degree of a frequency

509
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,140
that would be on that frequency squared times, the

510
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:14,550
logarithm of one minus E. To the energy, the

511
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:19,190
temperature must be a each Kakamega coming from

512
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:24,330
the energy of. The football is a function of the

513
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,450
continuous. And frequency, frequency.

514
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:36,210
So that is. The. Specific form of the grant

515
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,650
potential for default, I guess we have just enough

516
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:46,720
time to go on and certain predictions out of this.

517
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,540
This expression of new questions about the steps

518
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,930
we went through to drive this or some of the

519
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,040
approximations that we induced along the way.

520
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:13,480
Let's let's get started with some of the more

521
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,810
interesting aspects of the photos. Yes, the

522
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,460
feeling is that we have remaining.

523
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,580
We're in order to extract a more quantities like

524
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,660
the average energy density of photon gas. We just

525
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,850
need to take appropriate derivatives of that great

526
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:39,900
potential must be derived at six, which again,

527
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,350
simplifies things to be able to set the chemical

528
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:47,070
potential equal to zero, removing the constraints

529
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:55,130
on the number of photons. Our presence in our gas

530
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:02,790
microstates, so if we. Take the. General

531
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:06,330
expression for the average internal energy in the

532
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:10,830
ensemble later to the day, the derivative of the

533
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:16,230
times, the corresponding canonical potential. We

534
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:21,060
can express this as itself, and if you go over the

535
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,580
frequencies of the photons.

536
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,340
Divining through by the overall power of the boy

537
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,950
to consider an average energy density.

538
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:41,390
Where the integral in this expression is crucially

539
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,900
known as a spectrum density or just a spectrum

540
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,190
that relates how much energy in the gas is

541
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,220
connected to photons of a given frequency or by

542
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,750
the. So I'm sorry that this school district uses

543
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:01,510
the same symbol as the pressure of the context to

544
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,590
keep it clear when we're talking about the

545
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,050
structure density of energy and when we are

546
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,360
talking about the pressure

547
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:17,750
to. Go ahead and. Push this partial derivative

548
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:23,430
with respect to beta through the canonical

549
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,700
potential we had on the previous page just to get

550
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,080
a couple moments connected to it. We have a

551
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:33,870
divided three by the volume factor. Beta cancels

552
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:37,760
the temperature up front. So we have one over Kubi

553
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:42,050
Square left over and then we can push the beta

554
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:47,060
derivative all the way into long ago. I think that

555
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:47,630
depends.

556
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,040
And the.

557
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:02,060
Derivative of this dog is going to start with the

558
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:08,740
arguments in the denominator. Everyone at minus to

559
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:12,460
the minus beta, each particle bigger than the

560
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:17,040
chamber brings it through and have a negative the

561
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:21,700
to the negative beta, each part will make the

562
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:26,040
numerator. Bring down then another application of

563
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,950
the Chambal derivative of that with respect to

564
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:32,330
data as an overt factor of minus.

565
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:39,410
Where the negative signs cancel and we can pull

566
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:45,800
the constant each bar into this prefecture and

567
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,770
each other secured a square.

568
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,830
Integral from zero to infinity now of. Three

569
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:58,490
powers of Omega, an additional one brought down

570
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:02,690
from the derivative and the dividing through by

571
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,960
this exponential factor, as we did before when

572
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,340
considering the. Average occupation numbers for

573
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:15,200
the present statistics have to be positive. Better

574
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,020
able to make a modest one. Then that derivatives

575
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,410
sorry, the integration over Homebake itself.

576
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:33,330
Identify this as a control over. Our spectral

577
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,880
density is a function of the lack of.

578
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:43,240
We can identify exactly what this spectral density

579
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,210
is. The cost of each bar over the speed of light

580
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:54,510
squared. Tons aspiration of a magnitude. But with

581
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:59,020
the exponential etchberger, the temperature minus

582
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:03,490
one, which reassuringly is.

583
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:10,400
You have written down as a result, one defined in

584
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:15,420
the equation, 95, your result that is known as the

585
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:20,730
spectrum that named after the same bucksbaum whose

586
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,520
constant you've been considering. Since all the

587
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,390
way back and forth and just to.

588
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:36,810
Take care of. Not a bit of manipulation of this

589
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:43,840
spectrum, including Bill. Analyze it as a function

590
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,590
of wavelength, so rather than the spectrum, as a

591
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:49,870
function of frequency relating to the energy of

592
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,080
the photon gas to the corresponding frequency to

593
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:55,960
the photons in that gas, you can relate the energy

594
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,530
to the gas, the wavelengths that are inversely

595
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:08,460
proportional to the frequency. So. If I out. A bit

596
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,690
of space in this gap just to. Note the change of

597
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:16,740
variables that Omega is two pi times the speed of

598
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:23,220
light divided by the wavelength of the Omega is

599
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:27,390
going to be the derivative of that with respect to

600
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:35,190
LAMDA. So negative two squared Delenda. We can

601
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:39,720
also see that. The lower integration limits make

602
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:44,550
it close to zero, and that corresponds to the wave

603
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:47,500
length going to infinity. And similarly, the

604
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,360
proper integration limits of infinite frequency

605
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:58,420
corresponds to banish wavelength. So plugging this

606
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:07,080
in, we have a minus. Director of. Well, you have

607
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:11,380
to high C over lambda for each of these three

608
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:16,880
factors, omega. We have a fourth factor of two

609
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,490
high. See, coming from deal maker with a single

610
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:27,820
negative sign, a deal maker is now a de lamda,

611
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,940
each part comes along for the ride, as does the

612
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:37,280
speed of light squared the denominator. The lower

613
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,200
limit of integration is now going from infinity

614
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,240
down to zero over the wave length.

615
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:52,090
The deal may go to the lame duck. We have three

616
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:56,560
powers of land from the Omega Cube, another two

617
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:02,110
hours from the omega of the due to power, five in

618
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:02,950
the denominator.

619
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:09,550
And then the exponential factor is almost to say.

620
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:17,480
It'll be too high. Beater, each bar scene divided

621
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,870
by the state is all the arguments of the

622
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:25,140
exponential than the final minus one. Unaffected.

623
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:34,490
And that would simplify this slightly, the power

624
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:39,820
of two of the four is 16. We can absorb the

625
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,890
negative side by reversing the order of the

626
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:47,600
integration. I see I'm running out of time, so

627
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,080
just write down the results here we have each bar

628
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:56,490
for over three hours at sea and then we go zero to

629
00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:03,420
infinity and the fifth. Used to be that each

630
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:08,900
person will handle this one. We identified this.

631
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:17,410
As expected from units of wavelength, we find the

632
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:21,220
same result. We'll just put up here to wrap up

633
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:26,680
today at 16 per square studio and the fifth time

634
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:30,140
that whatever exponential minus one Planck

635
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:34,150
spectrum. As a function of wavelength, so we

636
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,280
reconvene tomorrow morning, starting today, we

637
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,220
will talk a bit about the meaning of this result

638
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:46,940
will be computed and. Look in particular at how it

639
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:50,600
matches up to the actual systems of photons in

640
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,140
nature coming from solar radiation, from the sun

641
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,910
back home, from the Big Bang and everything in

642
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:03,920
between. So it's the final check if there are

643
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,150
questions about the derivation of this average

644
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:10,820
energy density we just went through to define the

645
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:17,680
spectrum. And I guess you have all that to think

646
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,530
about it and see it exactly before we pick up

647
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:22,690
right here tomorrow morning.

648
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:30,590
I'll see you on that.

649
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:37,410
So.
