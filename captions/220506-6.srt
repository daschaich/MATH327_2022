1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:08,840
Okay, sorry for delay getting underway. In addition

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,320
to Zoom

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,780
not behaving itself on here, there were also issues with the

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:25,960
printer again, which means that we don't have things printed out to go through

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,220
some of the derivations we'll be talking

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:37,430
about today.  Though I did manage to make a note of the code

7
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,050
for this afternoon's class,

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:43,750
which if I copied it down correctly should be

9
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:52,370
five eight, two seven, six eight.

10
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,240
And, let's get

11
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,990
started, as usual, by checking in to see if you have any

12
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,190
questions about what we've gone through in the module

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,970
so far, what remains or

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,220
to that?

15
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:29,090
And if not, then we ran out of time last week,

16
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:36,210
going through the third. How they plan for for the

17
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,290
tutorial, which was just to give a little

18
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,670
reorientation on the security problem, looking at

19
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,340
different structures versus thinking more

20
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,630
qualitatively about the possible grievances,

21
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,710
responding to order to disorder two phases

22
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,700
depending on the level of structure. And

23
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,490
countering the concept of frustrated anti-terror

24
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:08,440
magnetism where. There are trying to the Latisse

25
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,830
that is not bipartite, so I'm trying to remember

26
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,790
now how much of this we actually discussed last

27
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,270
week and how much was just in the pit of the

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:25,150
solutions that went online a few days ago. But

29
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,390
bipartite Gladys's like those.

30
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,050
Which include those like the square and Honeycomb

31
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,990
badasses, allowed all of the latest sites to be

32
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:42,060
broken up into two distinct sets its theby and the

33
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,580
parts dividing all the sites into two different

34
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,980
parts, like square minus the serial, red, black,

35
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,320
checkerboard and. Which also holds the shifted way

36
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,870
for the.

37
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:07,310
Lettuce. But not for the utilities, so that if we

38
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:16,220
have to sell one bit of spin there, one down there,

39
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,970
if an entity, a couple that prefers this

40
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,190
orientation to reduce the energy, then there is no

41
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,780
way of making all three interactions between these

42
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,050
three.

43
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,920
Also, the order one or the other of them has to be

44
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,560
giving a positive contribution to the energy or

45
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:47,600
frustrated one that is expanded to the full set of

46
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,230
lattice with many sites. Then there are many

47
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:56,090
possible ground states. Most are all degenerate

48
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,410
and trying to keep track of all of these

49
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,370
configurations with that grossetête energy is one

50
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:10,070
of these exponentially hard, not polynomial. Not

51
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,200
deterministic all your problems in. Some

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,350
situations. So. Maybe the best thing for me to do,

53
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,120
which is why I'm back on canvas.

54
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,140
Wants to.

55
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,700
Grab the file that was uploaded next, I think

56
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,800
should be in the discussion, so make sure that you

57
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,800
are able to get it even before it's uploaded to

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,430
that module. Paige.

59
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:59,040
OK, so I'll fix that this afternoon and go through

60
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,190
the back door that is available to me at.

61
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,670
And windows were just not built at the moment.

62
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,840
We'll have here once it loads a better

63
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,830
illustration of. The frustrated MP for magnetism

64
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,730
that we went through last week, should it ever

65
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,140
choose to load a small PDF?

66
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,120
What's going on?

67
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,550
Should not be.

68
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,230
Such a challenge, so here it is, finally,

69
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,000
technology going slow, but it gets there and so

70
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,980
this little drawing here on the on the right

71
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,620
actually took from a paper all the way back in

72
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,470
nineteen fifty showing a one of the many. States

73
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,760
of this A.M. is a model of the triangle, the

74
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,470
latest that has the minimum ground energy, there

75
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,100
are all sorts of ways that the. Upward pointing at

76
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,700
the point expense, the pluses and minuses in the

77
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,060
system can be shifted in order to keep that same

78
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,940
energy. So even in the limit of absolute zero

79
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,330
temperature, all of those battleground states

80
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,760
produce a non-zero entropy for the system. And

81
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,400
trying to you can prove that in the latest system.

82
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,830
So not just the simple Tudeh frustrated energy for

83
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,710
a but going into three dimensions or looking at

84
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,170
the random spin class couplings.

85
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,500
It's possible to prove that. Solving those systems

86
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,910
is ENPI complete problem in the language of

87
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,520
theoretical computer science, that any

88
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,250
non-deterministic polynomial task can be mapped to

89
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,440
solving such a system where this non-deterministic

90
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,070
polynomial means that if you have an answer given

91
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,370
to you, it's quick and easy to check. But actually

92
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,720
finding that answer in a systematic way is hard

93
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,840
for Sheck. Part of the sense that the amount of

94
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,110
work required for any algorithm increases

95
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,780
exponentially with, in this case, the number of

96
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,390
lattice sites. So

97
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,480
that was.

98
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,450
Stuff that we discussed, if not in so much detail

99
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,240
last week, went through the bare bones of it and.

100
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,760
Focus on. So.

101
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:06,780
Using model with. A couple in jail could be thrown

102
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,690
into granted for a positive or negative, but the.

103
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,430
Novel feature here that we consider. That's one of

104
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,300
the simple tilings of two dimensional space and

105
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,880
fully connected lattice, or a complete graph,

106
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,480
which is the. Diagram that I had on here, and I

107
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,870
don't think we had a chance to discuss this last

108
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:35,320
week, so. What the complete graph is sort of I

109
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,640
tend to call the fully connected lattice just to

110
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,280
emphasize the connection to the other lattices

111
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,820
with the. Thinking about is every single site is a

112
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,650
nearest neighbor of every other site, which we can.

113
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,250
Interpret in a couple of different ways, the more

114
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:59,020
physical lay and the more mathematical. The more

115
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,350
abstract mathematical way we have, the idea that

116
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,080
all of the sites in the system are equally far

117
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,430
away from each other, which is not possible to bad

118
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,580
ratio in a two dimensional surface.

119
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,670
Essentially, we are treating these mathematically

120
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,640
as of all of the lines in each of these, lattices

121
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,300
is the same length. Whether they're connecting

122
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,020
those two points, they're those two points or

123
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,270
they're just the same distance in some abstract

124
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,620
space, in a more physical approach. You can say

125
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,260
that maybe the distance doesn't matter as a

126
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,810
physical length, but the strength of the

127
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,320
interaction is the same independent of that

128
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,790
distance, so that if you have arrangements of

129
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,640
particles like this in some crystal, there's a

130
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,310
long range interaction between them. They all

131
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,800
behave essentially as though they were right next

132
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,400
to each other

133
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,400
in terms of how that interaction.

134
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,970
Manifest itself, the effects of that interaction

135
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,840
on all the different particles so you can go

136
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,600
through the accounting here, but it's also an easy

137
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,830
question to see that. There are one 1/2 times

138
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:28,960
entertained by this one leaks in this total fully

139
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,810
connected Latisse over every one of the insights

140
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,950
there are in minus one links to the miners from

141
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,490
other sites. And then each of those links has two

142
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,100
sites out there. And so there's a double counting

143
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,990
for that argument and also recognize that.

144
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,180
Factor of in times of minus one or two as the

145
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,830
binomial coefficient of choosing two sites out of

146
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,950
the total. Fought to define each one, so the total

147
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,250
number of links is scaling like the square of the

148
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,460
number of sites in every state, hands and legs

149
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:16,860
connected to it, and the total number of sites.

150
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:24,720
And the task was to consider using model on this

151
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,320
fully connected lattice. And.

152
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:35,300
Try to see if we can solve it, similar to the way

153
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,020
we solved the using model on the one dimensional

154
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:45,200
chain of spins this morning. This is one of the

155
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,410
situations where an interacting system of this

156
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,120
sort has an exact analytic solution. The partition

157
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,300
function can be expressed. As a closed formality

158
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,830
expression rather than a sum over all

159
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:09,000
configurations and fight back to these comments

160
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,140
that the printer refused to give me a few minutes

161
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,270
ago, the.

162
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,470
Starting point for this was the hit we lost over

163
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,220
last week and something that. I showed off earlier

164
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,950
in the week as.

165
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,630
With a bit of a connection to going from. The

166
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,140
sweet songs to continuous intervals in this case.

167
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,660
The answers to rather than trying to sum over each

168
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,830
individual, link some over the different possible

169
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,340
values of the magnetization when each of these

170
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,840
sites can be pointing upward. So.

171
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,650
We know that.

172
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,670
For insights, there are countless one possible

173
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:13,250
values of discussion and all the of I not one, so

174
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,500
that half of them get zero or give them all the

175
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:22,670
lie down. There is an plus one. Going from the

176
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,370
overall accusation of negative one plus one, those

177
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,270
limits. And then for a large enough and

178
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,230
enforcement values, all evenly spaced in that

179
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:39,480
interval plus minus one, we can replace that sum

180
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,330
over the discrete values with the integral over

181
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,020
the continuous value similar to what we did before

182
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,790
with ideal gases and what showed up and generated

183
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,310
some questions about the homework that was due

184
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,480
yesterday. So that's why I didn't save this

185
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,050
discussion to have right now, but at least the

186
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:05,740
first little bit of the solution. On the Qantas

187
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,270
side earlier in the week, where the key what

188
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,670
distinguishes this fully connected Latisse from

189
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,430
the easy model we've been considering all square

190
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,270
and trying to lattices and so on, is that. Now,

191
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,060
with all of the sites connected to all of the

192
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,880
other sites and straightforward to break up this

193
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:33,500
sum over all of those links into a product of some

194
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,430
over individual sites, would you give us that

195
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,320
magnetization that we're going to be integrating

196
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,140
over just the. Average value of the spin's, some

197
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,380
for all the sites. So.

198
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,730
We started off with the song over J. Less than K

199
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,190
to avoid double counting, but we can't just as

200
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,180
well double counted, added a factor of two. So

201
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,540
that's a fairly trivial identity, getting all the

202
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,910
changes that are not equal to KS. And if we

203
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,680
replace the sum over S.J time, this came with a

204
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,470
product of the two songs. One over S.J. and S.K.,

205
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,480
this product will have all of the terms we want

206
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,620
and also all of those we don't want J equals K, so

207
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,010
there are any of those for each value of J equals

208
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,090
K, they give a factor of S squared, which is

209
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,540
always one for E in the plus minus one, and we

210
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,220
subtract that off and have everything in terms of

211
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,760
the magnetization. So sum over and values of one

212
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,000
and. And there are the two factors of in times

213
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,590
stabilization there, so the energy then as the

214
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,480
simple form of writing everything in terms of

215
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:02,400
acquisition, and then that gives us the partition

216
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,940
function as the sum of all possible values of the

217
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:09,770
mechanisation times, the exponential minus theta

218
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,140
times, the energy. I can't scribble over the

219
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,400
screen that's up here, but I can sort of point to

220
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,850
different features of this map. You may already

221
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,740
have looked at this and go through it fairly

222
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,750
quickly.

223
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,780
Split things up into terms one that depends on

224
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,300
that couple, on the defense, on the external field

225
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,980
age, and then each value of the magnetization is

226
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,390
defined by the number of upper expense or the

227
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,480
number of Delaporte expense with our usual

228
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,780
binomial coefficients, the total number of spins

229
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:57,360
choosing, that's a pretty pointed number. So

230
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,400
converting this into an integral to the

231
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,470
magnetization, the next step is to express this

232
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,920
binomial coefficient in terms of the magnetization.

233
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,620
And I may give you five minutes or so to to play

234
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,790
with that and get a expression for the partition

235
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,450
function entirely in terms of the magnetization,

236
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,050
and then you can start to think about how that

237
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,500
might be evaluated to get a closed form expression

238
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,220
or, in other words, to exactly solve this

239
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,400
particular system. So let me know if this is

240
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,920
something that you have already done during the

241
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,830
week. I suspect not given the homework to

242
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,760
yesterday, but

243
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,600
so long as you keep yourselves entertained, say,

244
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,140
for the next five minutes, pause the recording and

245
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,650
check in that door before pausing to say if there

246
00:17:54,650 --> 00:18:00,440
are any questions about what the next step or

247
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,850
steps would be in the quest to solve this

248
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,450
expression.

249
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,750
I'll give you a chance to work on it rather than

250
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:21,050
just listening to me ramble on. So I've got the

251
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,990
recording back the way again and. Now that you've

252
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,200
had a little bit of time to wrestle with this and

253
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,510
see it's moving pieces, I'll reveal a nice trick

254
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:37,440
that can help to simplify things, though I should

255
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,630
mention that there are. Several distinct ways of

256
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,980
solving articles of this sort, so what we're doing

257
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,000
today is one focused on combinatorics and

258
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,860
approximations, and it's also possible to

259
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,020
introduce auxillary variables, what's called a

260
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,220
cover story, part of its transformation. And in

261
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,560
these comments, there's a link to a whole textbook

262
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:07,250
whose second chapter is solving this system, but

263
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,650
is sometimes noted security advice model rather

264
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,010
than using model on the fully connected lattice.

265
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:20,210
The trick that can help us simplify the approach

266
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,120
commented on in these comments is to take this

267
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,970
fundamental fact

268
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,260
and this fact factorial.

269
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,600
Only I left enough space in front of that to cast

270
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:47,150
an exponential. Will, this new law helps in a few

271
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:51,410
ways. First of all, that exponential factor added

272
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,880
to the exponential speed multiplier against the

273
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,400
overall degree and just becomes the single

274
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,900
exponential of this logarithm, plus that being

275
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,880
able to anticipate a this one possibly better H

276
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,100
and M, and you can also.

277
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,500
Expand the logarithm of this ratio of factories in

278
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:22,310
the usual way, so the living couple of terms and

279
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,810
service expansion of that toilet is more and more

280
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:31,650
in line, minus an. We'll have the minus and plus,

281
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,110
plus, plus, minus the kids that only your

282
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,160
children's names and.

283
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:53,370
And subscripts, and then it's being in the

284
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,890
relation between him and mechanisation. We get the

285
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,110
first step, complete the partition function

286
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,700
expressed.

287
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:10,520
So I mentioned that in the course of plugging in

288
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,600
this expression, there are some nice cancellations

289
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,660
and simplifications. So.

290
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:26,360
What we can see is that. There are anywhere to

291
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,390
look in terms two of those that cancel off the

292
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:35,010
meeting, then log in. And then there are two

293
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,630
factors of an over to a half with the negative

294
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,860
sign, which is plus over to the law, to this two

295
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,790
factors that give an analog to an area to look for

296
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,380
properties that the logarithm and then for the

297
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,990
arguments of the log would be minus and over two

298
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,680
times log one plus one minus seven. We have a

299
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,450
minus or two types of log of quantity. One minus

300
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,190
ten squared can absorb that negative side to put

301
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,960
it into the. And finally, the midterms come in

302
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,540
with opposite sides, minus in the first term and

303
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:20,190
plus in the second. So we have over two times the

304
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:25,170
log of that second argument, one minus M over that

305
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:30,510
log of one plus N. And then we insert that back

306
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:35,220
into the partition function we had about to pull

307
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,620
out the Halstead's magnetization and the piece

308
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:46,380
there is missing DNA there where, as advertised,

309
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,630
we have just the overall exponential of some

310
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:55,980
series of terms that we get out of the vaccination

311
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:04,410
for the final factor. And then on. And then Jagan

312
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:10,200
Square an inch that we had before, is it possible

313
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,860
to get both of these on the same screen? Not so

314
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:19,020
easily you can recognize. That after pulling out

315
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,810
that overall factor of nd you're left with those

316
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,290
final two terms that appear here and what I've

317
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,490
done at the end of this first line is pull out the

318
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,910
overall factor and and represent that as the

319
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:36,640
exponential of this function of the position, race

320
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,530
and power.

321
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,260
And.

322
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:43,930
I guess the.

323
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,100
The next step that.

324
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,900
We could go through that I may already flash on

325
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,680
the screen, is how to evaluate this integral now

326
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,510
that it is all expressed as a somewhat awkward

327
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,160
function of that magnetization.

328
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,790
And what we can do is take an approach similar to

329
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,540
what we did and looking at the Sommerfeld

330
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,590
expansion just before the spring break, we argued

331
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:27,740
that. These exponential functions that we're

332
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:35,160
integrated over have some steep peak in. So they

333
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:36,970
this.

334
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,390
The.

335
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,070
Peake is going to be further amplified in this

336
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,540
case by the exponential function being raised to

337
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:57,640
the power of a very large integer, no greater than

338
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:04,480
one. So a solution, a way to solve this equation,

339
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,510
sometimes called the closest method, a step is to

340
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:15,460
sense method is to find the maximum of this

341
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,730
function that is being exponentially added and

342
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,570
then having that exponential rate to the power and.

343
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:32,280
Prove. Are your to assume that? It is. Harrex to

344
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:38,000
approximatively function. Around that maximum,

345
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:41,170
this is the effect of losing the public safety

346
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:46,350
that we did in the context of quantum gases, and

347
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:50,460
then that simplifies the structure of the integral

348
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,240
enough to to solve it in a fairly straight order.

349
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,730
So.

350
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,230
I think at this point, you may as well just keep

351
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,810
talking through the solution rather than going

352
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,870
back and forth and leaving it for you to play with

353
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,460
things, the first step of following that procedure

354
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:23,330
is to find the maximum of this function itself.

355
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,240
Which we need to take the derivative of all of

356
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,260
this with respect to M., the final two terms are

357
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,610
easy ones that long for his independent so we can

358
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,890
get rid of that. And.

359
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,920
As we go through this review of.

360
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,580
May as well work through some aspects of it in the

361
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,160
first term, we have that one of the finest and

362
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,060
square which is moving into the denominator, the

363
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,020
beginning of two times and the numerator that

364
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,140
cancels out to be the denominator.

365
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,320
And in front of the factory of.

366
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,030
The fact the. And then when taking the derivative

367
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:27,890
of M times the log, we can recall ratio of two

368
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:28,250
separate

369
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:37,120
times, the derivative of. One minus one minus

370
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:44,800
seven is now with the Chambal. Negative sign in

371
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,910
the numerator and then the denominator will be

372
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,250
negative four plus M signs

373
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:01,450
for other factors of negative one coming from the

374
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:05,670
chain will last two terms. Just give us bitted J

375
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,000
and B, the beach.

376
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,390
The noise cancellation of the.

377
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:20,940
We arrange.

378
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:28,370
Two factors here, that factor, the denominator is

379
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,440
one more than.

380
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:37,820
So out about the denominator, we have one minus in

381
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,120
Times

382
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:45,620
Square. So their willingness to the to their end

383
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,630
of the numerator and one minus in the denominator.

384
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,130
So this term here, which is that entirely in the

385
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:59,270
left with just the log and the

386
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,060
two simple terms that depend on that coupling

387
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:09,090
electric field. And the log itself is actually a

388
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,090
bit simpler than it might seem at first glance,

389
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,040
thanks to a new identity, that once they don't

390
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,700
have to look up from hyperbolic trigonometry, that

391
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,800
the inverse hyperbolic tangent of some function is

392
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:31,440
one 1/2 times the log of there's a typo here. The

393
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,130
actual relation is one plus in the numerator and

394
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,030
one minus in the denominator, and we can reverse

395
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:44,160
with an overall negative sign on the log. So this

396
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,910
term here

397
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,630
is negative.

398
00:29:52,950 --> 00:30:00,020
And we found this to be the times and for each

399
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,790
of the interesting sets distributed to zero to

400
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:12,630
identify extremely simply that the. Magnetization

401
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,730
itself at the extreme end of this argument is the

402
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:21,780
chance of better times JAAM plus stage, which is

403
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,730
essentially the self consistency condition that we

404
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,390
derived.

405
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,060
Through the midfield approximation earlier this

406
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:37,470
week. And we study the solutions in some detail.

407
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,930
The only difference here compared to the lecture

408
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,670
earlier this week is the presence of the coupling,

409
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:50,540
Jay, coming from the definition of the model.

410
00:30:53,770 --> 00:31:01,120
There is better than the two times that we had in

411
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,450
the midfield approximation, counting the simple

412
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:09,490
Kubic nearest neighbor pairs for each spin in that

413
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:15,160
context, and I guess based on comments at the end

414
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,840
of our treatment of the midfield approach, it's

415
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:24,220
not surprising to see. A way to recover the

416
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,980
Medfield result from this fully connected lattice,

417
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,940
precisely because we saw the wheels of

418
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,590
approximation perhaps better the more neighbors

419
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,250
each side has, and it is fully connected that as

420
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:40,130
each side has that maximum number of neighbors. So

421
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,690
it's another derivative to distinguish Minimbah

422
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:48,230
from Máximo after we've set the first derivative

423
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:52,220
to zero. We want that second derivative to be less

424
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,480
than zero to get a maximum. And this is an even

425
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,570
simpler derivative that we can now pretty much do

426
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:05,150
in our heads what we did before today, one by one,

427
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:08,060
over one minus M squared, and that's remaining

428
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:13,430
factor of beta. So if we consider that this sort

429
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,940
of solution to the self-consistent condition, we

430
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:23,240
see that this is only a maximum of the arguments

431
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,630
appearing in the partition function when beta is

432
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:30,110
sufficiently small so that the second derivative

433
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,540
is less than zero. And this is an alternative way

434
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,980
of identifying that critical temperature rather

435
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,480
than looking at the what I call the flow lines of

436
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,940
trying to resolve that, self-consistent the

437
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,910
condition of the graphical method we went through

438
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:52,200
in the lecture. This tells us the points, the

439
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:55,830
what's called the curious temperature, where this

440
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,200
disorder selection becomes unstable and the

441
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,000
ordered solutions remain stable. And if we focus

442
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,550
on those. Stable ordered solutions at. Arbitrarily

443
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:13,600
small temperatures, they remain máxima as that.

444
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,160
Stable value, the solution of itself, and this is

445
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:23,140
a condition approaches one and this. Ratio

446
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:29,290
diverges. And we can then plug in as they all fit

447
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:32,830
on the same screen, not quite. Keep an eye on this

448
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:36,520
and plug it into the usual Taylor expansion around

449
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:41,710
one of those two non-zero solutions, the ordered

450
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:45,970
phase, knowing that in order to account for the

451
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,390
second solution, we will just have to double what

452
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,050
we get out of considering this one side of the

453
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,400
diagram of the expansion of the entire ground

454
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:02,720
around this maximum. But this line here is just

455
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,680
plugging in what we had earlier. In terms of the

456
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,150
full function F, it appears in the grand. Jeff

457
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,260
organized in such a way to call back to that

458
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,260
self-consistent deconditioned in terms of this

459
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:23,240
representation of the. Our tenge, which cancels

460
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,090
out almost everything in these brackets, except

461
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:32,060
for a minus MJM zero over two and in particular

462
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,720
all explicit dependence on that external magnetic

463
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:41,570
field drops out. At these self-consistent points,

464
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:45,680
though, there remains implicit dependence in

465
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,670
determining what this M0 actually is, the solution

466
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,700
to that self-consistent condition.

467
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:57,140
But at this point, we are just about done, we can

468
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:03,500
take this expansion of. That function F and plug

469
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,000
it back in to where it first showed up in the

470
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,220
partition function we had. The exponential of end

471
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:20,600
times, this function f of the magnetization so we

472
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,290
can pull out now from that, if you go over to the

473
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:28,910
first two terms that do not depend on them. So

474
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:33,860
that gives us. Another factor of either the minus

475
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,460
and the timestep zero over two from the second

476
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:42,460
term and the exponential of that log is just its

477
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,040
arguments for over one minus seven squared raised

478
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,150
to the power of another two. And all that remains

479
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:57,050
in the integral is a nice Gaussian integration. So

480
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:01,970
long as we can expand the domain of integration

481
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:06,080
from minus one to one all the way out to minus

482
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,870
infinity to infinity, that is also something that

483
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,300
we justified with doing Sommerfeld expansion,

484
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:15,890
showing that the errors that are introduced by.

485
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,720
Including those nonphysical values of the

486
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:24,630
magnetization are exponentially small and indeed

487
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,520
vanish in that thermodynamic limit of going to

488
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,610
infinity, where there are rigorous balance, you

489
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:34,480
can prove and that. Are proven, if you want to see

490
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,940
them in in this book from published a few years

491
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,040
ago, some folks in Switzerland,

492
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:50,080
but proceeding to carry out that Gaussian

493
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,650
integration just gives us that square root of pi

494
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,830
divided by the multiplicative factor on the minus

495
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:06,420
seven squared, which is. Just one minus beta Jim

496
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:11,360
undisputedly and not squared, divided by what,

497
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:16,450
minus amnot squared? So in the end, we have a

498
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,780
closed form expression for the protection function,

499
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:23,350
we did do some expansions and approximations to

500
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,200
obtain this, and it is possible to show that this

501
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:32,770
is actually an exact solution with a bit more work

502
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,620
and a bit more care that I figured I would spare

503
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,470
you and.

504
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,820
Much as we saw this morning, we're looking at the

505
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,630
exact solution for the one, the easy model, just

506
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,990
having a partitioned function is not necessarily

507
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:55,190
so useful for us. Just looking at that, it's

508
00:37:55,190 --> 00:38:00,320
unclear what it really means in a intuitive

509
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,810
physical sense. The use of having this is as a

510
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:10,670
starting point for. Doing analysis of observables

511
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:14,510
coming from those derivatives of the free minus

512
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:19,280
two times blog, the petition function, and we've

513
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,550
actually seen what we will get for the

514
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:28,820
memorisation already when we isolated the.

515
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:34,250
Argument of the exponential and looked at its

516
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:38,450
extreme until we recovered the exactly the bean

517
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:43,390
field relation that we got from the field

518
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,940
approximation, which is the exact solution, the

519
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,840
transcendental equation coming from this partition

520
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,310
function, which resulted in class earlier in the

521
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:00,500
week to find this result for the magnetization and

522
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,470
in particular predictions for that critical

523
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:06,290
temperature and the critical exponents of the

524
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,860
corresponding second order phase transition. So.

525
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,990
In retrospect, I'm glad I gave a somewhat easier

526
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:21,440
problem on the homework rather than than this one,

527
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:27,140
but hopefully this was entertaining to see how the

528
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:31,120
analysis goes through to get exact results in

529
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,980
statistical physics. And it also calls back to

530
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,890
some of the techniques that we've seen before, the

531
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,620
