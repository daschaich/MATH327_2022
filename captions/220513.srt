1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,180
Okay, we can get under way. Welcome back to the

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,770
final day, part one.  We can start off with

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,300
the the last of these codes for this term.

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,710
We'll see if the system sticks around.

5
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,370
Anyway, the code for today is seven five,

6
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:34,720
zero five, two six.

7
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,290
And we will see today how well I've planned out the

8
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,230
last bit of material to go.  First, are the very questions

9
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:50,650
about the module

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,910
up until now, before we keep going with the last

11
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,210
few topics on broader applications.

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,670
So just see.

13
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,360
Thirteenth of May and the first half of this week,

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,640
we went through.

15
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,400
Was one year.

16
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,130
Duality.

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,060
What were these two dimensional using model, the

18
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,090
square lattice?

19
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,750
Which predicted the exact critical temperature of

20
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:43,210
the system to cover the log of one plus route to

21
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,070
Jefri, plug in the numbers to that exact formula,

22
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,680
temperature is enough to want to settle. And this

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,790
was obtainable through the duality without

24
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:01,150
actually. Being able to solve the original to

25
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,660
match up with a model or its dual system, which in

26
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,980
this special case turned out to be a similar look

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,660
at using model, is defined with dual speed

28
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,650
variables on the dual lattice, another square

29
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,500
lattice that just shifted about half a unique

30
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:26,640
dimension and is dualities are. A major. Tool in

31
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,980
the twenty first century theoretical physics

32
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,930
applied to all sorts of situations, mostly less

33
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,250
precise and less solidly defined than simple

34
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,600
creators wanted to do reality.

35
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,500
Where certain systems exhibits in some

36
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,320
circumstances the same behavior as other dual

37
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,520
systems that may be easier to analyze, the special

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,800
case should have holographic duality. Is that

39
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,840
really quantum gravity to quantum field theories

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,100
that are so different from the system systems

41
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,230
we've working with and will probably pop up before

42
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,950
the end of this hour? And another? Equally

43
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,130
widespread. Tool in the.

44
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,940
Modern analysis of complex systems.

45
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,010
Numerical analysis of contract statistical systems.

46
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,100
Making use of the.

47
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,410
Has computers that have been developed over the

48
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:46,210
past 70 years or so. Where? We saw that.

49
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,060
If we were to try to do a brute force computation

50
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,450
of all of the microstates, then a statistical

51
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,470
system, even with the most powerful supercomputers

52
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,320
we can imagine building that obey the laws of

53
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,670
physics, a calculation of that sort of small,

54
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,900
simple systems would require far longer than the

55
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,540
age of the universe to complete. So. The only way

56
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,180
we can actually get results from these miracle

57
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,550
analysis is to do so-called sampling. Not a small

58
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:30,150
number. Of microstates in the system, which. Leads

59
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:36,360
to that same challenge and a different guys where

60
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,890
the number of microstates, the proportion that we

61
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,160
can reasonably sample in the amount of time we

62
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,020
want our calculations to run before we have

63
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,300
results is vanishingly small. One example here,

64
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,550
where only about one out of every 10 to the power,

65
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,870
three hundred twenty four million microstates

66
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,820
could possibly be sample in. This was for the

67
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,540
prediction of the critical temperature of the five

68
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,430
dimensions and the solution to this we mentioned

69
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,670
Tuesday. But any details about it is a approach

70
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,990
known as important sampling. Where?

71
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,220
What we do is instead of randomly sampling or

72
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,400
pseudo randomly sampling microstates just drawn

73
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,200
without any knowledge about the system or the full

74
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,780
range of possible microstates, we design

75
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,340
procedures that.

76
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,870
I guarantee to sample any particular microstates

77
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,550
with a probability that is proportional to its

78
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,340
factor factor, the amount to which it contributes

79
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:59,510
to any given expectation value or. Arbitrary

80
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,810
expectation value is given by some of microstates

81
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,560
of the observable itself, weighted by. This

82
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,970
probability in the multifactor neutralized by the

83
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:10,840
protection function.

84
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,940
And the procedures that are designed to do this.

85
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,270
I'm sure you've heard the term algorithm's, you

86
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:18,720
may not

87
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,380
know that it's named after actually a 9th century

88
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,230
Persian mathematician for his

89
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:36,210
name, got Latinist to allegorically. And the idea

90
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,820
is. And that's where as an illustration, going

91
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,490
back to the example with the last time we're

92
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,280
worried about a low temperature phase of the U.S.

93
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:52,290
model where we would have to. Find the minimum

94
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,680
energy microstates to all the expectation values,

95
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,460
if we do have such an algorithm that samples

96
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,380
microstates proportional to the exponential of the

97
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,630
speed of times, their energy that in that low

98
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,430
temperature regime is very large, this exponential

99
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,710
factor is going to be exponentially enhanced for

100
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,860
exactly those low energy states that we want to

101
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,800
find. So if we have such an algorithm, then it

102
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:30,270
will sample exactly the microstates that we need.

103
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,120
And it also continues to work with the high

104
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,280
temperature phase where the probability is for

105
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,670
each of the microstates become similar. There's

106
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,320
less of an issue. With sampling only a very small

107
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,950
number of them.

108
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:56,640
So. Let me know if that general idea is not clear.

109
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,710
What I'll do in the meantime is move on and start

110
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,710
thinking about how we actually get important,

111
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:09,680
simple algorithm. Rather than assuming that we

112
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,220
have one. Given the challenge that you don't

113
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,150
actually know the probabilities of the microstates,

114
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,990
that trying to sample after this depends on the

115
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,310
energies of all those microstates and also

116
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,060
mobilized by the petition function. So actually,

117
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,090
computing all of these to check whether our

118
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,540
algorithms sample them correctly would get us back

119
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,850
to require that brute force computation at the

120
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:42,040
forward function and then waiting far longer to do

121
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,420
so.

122
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:50,050
So there are various solutions to this that. Have

123
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:50,380
been.

124
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:58,830
Invented. And the essence of. Each of them is that

125
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,100
is the casting aspect of the algorithms, the use

126
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,830
of the pseudo random numbers are. Taking advantage

127
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,190
of to guide the system to these important high

128
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,550
probability microstates that actually knowing what

129
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,860
those probabilities are in absolute terms, but

130
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,100
only in in relative terms and. Importantly,

131
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,920
whatever procedures in place to encourage the

132
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,800
system to go to these of microstates, this has to

133
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,480
be done without introducing the other bias that

134
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,960
could lead to incorrect results being predicted

135
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,400
more generally. Again, we have only this tiny

136
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,180
fraction of microstates available to analyze. So

137
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,570
probably the most famous way of doing this. Is an

138
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,110
algorithm that was developed now almost seven

139
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,240
years ago in nineteen fifty three by these five

140
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,140
folks, Nick Metropolis, Arianna Rosenbluth, Marcia

141
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,260
Elizabeth Taylor and Edward Teller. And I'm going

142
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,040
to call this metropolis, even though there are two

143
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,300
residences and two towers, there is sort of a.

144
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,530
Infamous misfiring of the alphabetical order here

145
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,070
that leads to this frequently being referred to as

146
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,130
chocolate.

147
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,220
Even though Petropolis himself was not actually

148
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,580
involved in developing the algorithm, he was the

149
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,570
source of the computer equipment that in 1953 was

150
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,420
very highly specialized and was used to test the

151
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,260
algorithm with a simple calculation that says you

152
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,550
can do pretty much instantaneously some.

153
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:55,730
And the. The approach that this Emirati metropolis

154
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:01,180
wrestles with tower algorithm takes to find high

155
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,950
probability microstates is that none of those

156
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,870
probabilities is to work with the Markov chains

157
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,070
that we actually introduced way back in February,

158
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,920
be the first unit of this module. And since it's

159
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,690
been a while since we saw that, I'll remind you

160
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,170
that this Markov chain is a process,

161
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,780
the state of the system and based on its state

162
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,980
microstates in the context of the samples, we

163
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,030
generate a new state that becomes a new link in

164
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,420
this chain. And importantly, that depends only on.

165
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,030
The.

166
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,840
Initial microstates that we start off with without

167
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,110
having any memory of looking for it. So if we had

168
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,190
to visually represent this sequence of states,

169
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,630
we'd have one sample here. This is used with some

170
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:07,120
aspects of some pseudo random number. What is

171
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,340
reproducible in the American population to

172
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,510
generate a new state that we forget all about that

173
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,460
previous states. Just keep the process in this

174
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,620
current one that still.

175
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,530
Up until we have the statistics that we need to do

176
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:32,410
the prediction for expectation values. Without

177
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,990
power, with controlled statistical uncertainties,

178
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,710
so. To illustrate the idea of the Metropolis Tower

179
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,370
algorithm. More concretely, we can go back to

180
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,940
choosing a model that we are now quite familiar

181
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,470
with. So each of these links in the chain is going

182
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,990
to be a configuration of the spin's. And you can

183
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,580
start off with any pseudo randomly chosen spin

184
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,730
configuration. So we microstates people. Well, as

185
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,090
the initial states at the start of the Walk of

186
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:16,260
Shame. But then from this initial configuration,

187
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,830
which was just one of the spins in the system,

188
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,710
changed it. So the only thing you can do on the

189
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,070
easy model is have only. Two values is the fact

190
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,940
that stem from up to down to vice versa, and then

191
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:37,460
we have the key step, which is to decide what the

192
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,300
next step is going to be based on flipping the

193
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,840
split. So. There are two possibilities, either we

194
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,960
define the next state to be the original system

195
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,130
unchanged or we define it to be the modified

196
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,030
system with the single been flipped and we accept

197
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,740
that spin flip with this maybe funny looking

198
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,700
probability, the minimum of one hundred percent

199
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,000
would be exponential of the change in the energy

200
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,340
divided by the temperature multiplied by.

201
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,480
So we can.

202
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,480
See, before we dig into this acceptance, probably

203
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:30,580
in more detail, it is crucial that we have the

204
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,660
capability of having the next

205
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,550
stage of the next stage of the identical to the

206
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,880
one that just came, because if we think back to

207
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,330
that low temperature phase where we want the

208
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,150
ground state to dominate expectations, bellman's.

209
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,150
You would want to see that ground states being

210
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,000
first weeks, this procedure then repeated over and

211
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,810
over again so that it does indeed make the

212
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:04,100
greatest contribution to the nation's interest in

213
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,220
which. Accounts for its alleged culpability

214
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,740
without actually knowing anything about that

215
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,420
microsleep probability. So. Talking through this

216
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,420
equation, one twenty four in more detail, we have

217
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,050
two possibilities when we look this spin.

218
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,030
First, the spin flip could lower the total energy

219
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,550
of the system or keep it constant, in which case

220
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,700
with the Alpha Delta E that is either negative or

221
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,760
less equal to zero. In both those cases, the

222
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,950
exponential factor is. More than one hundred

223
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,580
percent. And we always accept that change, so many

224
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,090
students look, that lowers the energy is accepted

225
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,500
100 percent probability, which helps US policies,

226
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,730
an approach that renewable energy to a seat so

227
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,720
long as it can be reached by the individual states.

228
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,200
But on the other hand, if we have inexpensive that

229
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,580
increases the energy, we'll still have a non-zero

230
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,660
chance of accepting that higher energy microstates

231
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,360
moving away from the ground states. But that

232
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,990
transition probability to the higher energy state

233
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,000
is exponentially suppressed and goes to zero as

234
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,250
the temperature goes to zero, which encourages the

235
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,110
system to hang out in its ground states. So if we

236
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,450
look at. The ratio of these transition

237
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,130
probabilities for to spin configurations that

238
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,140
differ only by flipping a single spin and this way

239
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:59,190
he calls it a B. And from our definition of the

240
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,330
acceptance probability. For them, the trouble was

241
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:07,070
not them, the probability of transitioning from A

242
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,850
to B is going to be the minimum of one or the

243
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:14,930
exponential of that difference, A minus equally

244
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,400
divided by the temperature

245
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,730
for going in the other direction from D.. A, it

246
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:27,480
will be the same to interchanging the roles of A

247
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,850
and B.. So its energy B minus energy divided by

248
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,330
the temperature and regardless of which of these

249
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:40,650
two microstates has the higher temperature. We

250
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,160
will always come out with. This ratio of ability

251
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,450
is being exponential by the speed of times by the

252
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,510
CIA. So we can just see through the two

253
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:57,510
possibilities if the energy bill is lower today

254
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,630
than the numerator here is one. And the

255
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,200
denominator is the exponential time to speed up by

256
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,740
the speed at which we can negate the argument of

257
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,230
the exponential spread from the denominator up to

258
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,140
the numerator. If we go the other way with the

259
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,690
exponential factor comes directly to the numerator,

260
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,940
the dominator is one. And we can then break up

261
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,570
that difference in the energies to just be the

262
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:28,640
ratio of the and factors for the two final stages

263
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:33,500
the day so the states have the change into. Are

264
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,770
selected proportional to their bottom factors

265
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,500
without actually having to impute or know those

266
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,680
factors in advance before we randomly propose the.

267
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,530
So. Both in this case and more generally, again,

268
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,110
these sorts of important sampling Markov chain

269
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,740
Monte Carlo algorithms are very likely applied to

270
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,740
all areas of the mathematical sciences and beyond.

271
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:09,230
Their statistical physics plays a big role in all

272
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:14,630
of these cases, so long as every micro stage can

273
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:19,460
be generated from every other microstates from the

274
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,580
series of pseudo random changes to the individual

275
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,340
degrees of freedom. Then this results the

276
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,060
acceptance probability that those guarantees that

277
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,360
the microstates are going to be stable with the

278
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,750
probability, without knowing those probabilities

279
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,900
in advance in this condition, that all the

280
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,230
microstates are accessible based on these

281
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:51,200
individual changes is called ergotism. Be funny

282
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,690
looking technical term where.

283
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,620
If we had an algorithm, which is not the case that

284
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,370
was not regarded, then the argument we went

285
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,010
through with this equation, one twenty five would

286
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,020
fail because there would be microstates that could

287
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,720
not be reached in the first place, will not show

288
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,570
up in the process through which the algorithm is

289
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,720
guided or feels out. The high probability

290
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,290
microstates it will be overlooked, omitted from

291
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,380
the averaging over the samples. That gives us

292
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,380
excited values and those expectation values. You

293
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,590
can either be completely wrong or at least biased.

294
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,720
Through overlooking those particular microstates.

295
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:47,480
So that is. All that I'm going to say about. These

296
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,030
numerical methods for interactive statistical

297
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:55,520
systems, the. It's pretty easy to design a full

298
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,780
module on that topic, one place you can look if

299
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,100
you want to play with this a bit more is in the

300
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,320
intruders introduction to general physics. The

301
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,440
second item on the list of which should be at the

302
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,230
library that actually provides a. Annotated a

303
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,880
program for running the metropolis, a for two

304
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,310
dimensional model that fits on a single page and

305
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,020
was used to generate the black and white speed

306
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,080
configurations that we looked at spent exploring

307
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,470
the easy model. A couple of weeks ago.

308
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:40,270
And I'll just mention, since it's very close to my

309
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,490
research, that although this metropolis wasn't

310
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,290
with our group is both very famous and very simple,

311
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,770
it's. In many cases, far from the best of the best

312
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,090
that we could have. And I don't think time is

313
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,900
going to permit, but one of the big issues that

314
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,860
this sort of algorithm encounters and Markov chain

315
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,890
multicolor algorithm to calculate generally, is

316
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,490
that because each link in the chain, which

317
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,730
microstates is pseudo randomly sample, depends on

318
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,230
the one that came before. It obviously resembles

319
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,050
that one that came before. This is especially

320
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:27,490
clear in the case of applying the sort of the easy

321
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:31,090
model where all of this is except one are

322
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,410
identical, even if the proposed update is

323
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:39,970
acceptable. So that means that the links in this

324
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,540
chain microseismic example are correlated to each

325
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,240
other. Let's call autocorrelation. And this

326
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,080
requires the chain to be run long enough so that

327
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:57,030
the micro say we started off with is forgotten, we

328
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:00,510
get something that is called in front rather than

329
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,690
being the same thing with just a few spins flipped.

330
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,230
And depending on the details of the algorithm that

331
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,590
is used to move from one of these states to the

332
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:17,560
next, those other correlations can linger for

333
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,810
exponentially longer numbers of samples, whereas

334
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:27,580
more clever algorithms I'm talking about this

335
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:33,090
afternoon if if there is time. There's more. It's

336
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:37,880
exponentially speed up the calculations. Or

337
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,340
equivalently, exponentially improve the

338
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,150
uncertainties and the results that we get for a

339
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,120
fixed amount of.

340
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,330
So are there any questions about. An important

341
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:55,100
sampling for multicolor. The metropolis was ruined

342
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,070
before we talk about the last sort of.

343
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,700
Formal theoretical topic for module.

344
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:17,600
This last topic before we do some a quick tour of

345
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,850
some border applications going into this afternoon,

346
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:26,710
because as you can see here, known as universality,

347
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,720
which has to do with phase transitions and in

348
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,350
particular the critical experience that govern

349
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:40,780
these transitions when in the case of second phase

350
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,620
transitions. So the perimeter is continuous and

351
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,800
there is typically a divergence in one or more of

352
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,350
its derivatives with respect to the control

353
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:55,630
parameter. So last week, the easy model, we looked

354
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,990
at the critical exponent governing the behavior of

355
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:02,110
the magnetization as the critical temperature is

356
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:08,910
approached from below, which. We found two very

357
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,060
four different numbers of dimensions and the

358
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:17,910
different approximations this is to be was a half

359
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:25,890
mean case. It was. And indeed, for the exact

360
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,790
solution to the 2D model, and it's just under a

361
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:34,800
third in the 3D case. That's not analytically

362
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,870
solvable. That can be analyzed numerically if you

363
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:43,630
algorithms like those just discussed. And in

364
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:46,000
addition to characterizing the behavior of this

365
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,540
system around its. Phase transition, the regime

366
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,480
where it undergoes its most dramatic changes in

367
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,020
response to these extraordinary parameters in the

368
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,690
course of the 20th century, it was discovered that

369
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,570
precisely the same sets of critical exponents turn

370
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,770
out to appear in these transitions of various

371
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:15,220
different systems that. You would not have guessed

372
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,700
have anything to do with each other so we can

373
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,330
illustrate this by considering the liquid gas

374
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,350
based transition to the one that we get when we

375
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:33,130
boil the water in the kitchen and the liquid water

376
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:36,640
in that kettle goes at first of all, depending on

377
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,620
the pressure on the first or second phase

378
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:43,270
transition into the atmosphere of the scene. This

379
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,200
is a fascinating topic to look at and could have

380
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,650
been a another supplement if we had more time to

381
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,160
get through things, because it does help to

382
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:56,230
illustrate even better than the simple, easy model

383
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:00,750
with the track extends just how. The difficulty

384
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,570
becomes to analyze. Statistical systems, when they

385
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,530
are interacting, so moving away from an ideal gas

386
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,210
to an interacting gas that can have strong enough

387
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:17,230
interactions to change to a different phase of

388
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,150
being a liquid at lower temperatures.

389
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,730
That removes the factorization that we rely upon

390
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,940
and dealing with with classical or quantum gases.

391
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,470
Before the break. And requires very elaborate.

392
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,250
Mathematical analysis to make any progress,

393
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,750
obtaining predictions from the microscopic degrees

394
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:49,970
of freedom. So just to not go through any of those

395
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,940
calculations, but sort of flash the results from

396
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,710
them. At least in regimes of low intensity, it's

397
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:02,000
possible to introduce a systematic approximation

398
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,230
scheme, what's called a cluster expansion that

399
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,980
produces, in the end a modification of the

400
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,630
equation of the state that deviates from the ideal

401
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:19,430
gas pressure times the volume of the gas equal to

402
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:23,170
the number of molecules in the gas times its

403
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:28,740
temperature. And to that leading turn, we can

404
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:34,140
introduce a series of corrections that depend on

405
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,300
the intensity of the number of atoms per unit

406
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,950
volume in this case that defines, well, that

407
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,760
appears here in the expansion, assuming the role

408
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,410
is much smaller than one. And each term in this

409
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:57,930
expansion has a factor that depends on the

410
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,720
temperature. It's known as a variable coefficient

411
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,550
for obscure historical reasons. And if you go

412
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,400
through that cluster expansion, you can compute

413
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:13,710
what this leading variable coefficients is, which

414
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,190
in turn, not surprisingly, depends on the

415
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:24,730
interaction between. Two particles in this gas, so

416
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:29,390
moving away from idealogue particles have the

417
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,970
interactions between the particles described by an

418
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,510
interaction energy. And because these gas

419
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,820
particles are not confined to a lattice, we have

420
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,790
no concept of Iraq's neighbors. Rather, the

421
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:43,820
interaction energy becomes a function of how far

422
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,000
apart those particles are. When they come closer

423
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,880
together, we expect them to tell each other, push

424
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,140
each other away. And larger businesses that can

425
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,110
either continue pushing each other apart or even

426
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:02,670
become attractive. And. Counteract that short

427
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,460
range reposing.

428
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,510
And while that's that's about the best we can do,

429
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,350
starting from the microscopic degrees of freedom,

430
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:17,170
this is insufficient to look at the liquid gas

431
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,360
field condition itself just because that phase

432
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,390
transition occurs.

433
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,190
That's a.

434
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:32,390
Higher density, which is not surprising given the

435
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,400
distinction between the density of liquid versus

436
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,420
gas, is one of the ways they can be distinguished.

437
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,440
The other chief where the professor or how hard it

438
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,430
is to to squeeze. Particles in these two phases

439
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,670
together, how much pressure do for a change? So

440
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,800
the liquid phase can be distinguished from the

441
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,490
gases by the higher density of liquid compared to

442
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,740
a gas. And the political temperature of that

443
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,100
liquid gas based transition can then be identified

444
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,130
when. The gas and liquid phase have equal

445
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:15,650
densities. Which then implies that this is the

446
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,570
intensity, that the transition is the largest that

447
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,560
the gas can actually reach while still remaining a

448
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,690
gas before it transitions to become a Liquidnet.

449
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:35,570
So as an alternative approach to this sort of

450
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:38,810
analysis, rather than starting from the

451
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:42,890
microscopic interactions between individual pairs

452
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:48,330
of particles and the gas. We can start from the

453
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,670
end point, that equation states that we would like

454
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:55,320
to drive instead of driving it, take it as a model

455
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,040
and propose modifications to this model to account

456
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:04,620
for the features of the interactive gas based on

457
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:08,400
some qualitative physical arguments. This was.

458
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,350
This approach was pioneered by a fellow named

459
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:16,060
Denver was so particular equation of state I've

460
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,960
written here is now known as the pendulum swing

461
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:24,900
states. Miss Daniels was awarded the Nobel Prizes

462
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,870
and one hundred, twelve years ago for work on this

463
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,520
declaration of state and world. Everyone's. In

464
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,790
this case, there are two modifications that would

465
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:43,580
be. Argued for through handwaving policy arguments

466
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:49,440
where compared to at times the intensity of the

467
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,900
gas war, you modify both the pressure and the

468
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,700
volume of the gas to account for more realistic

469
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,740
description of the gas particles than the non

470
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,830
interacting, zero sized point particles that we

471
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:11,390
worked with earlier in this module. So looking

472
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,180
first at this factor of the volume we are

473
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:20,230
subtracting in times a unknown. Numerical

474
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,900
parameter B, we can assume that. India are

475
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:29,610
positive numbers. And the interpretation of this

476
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,560
fact that we're subtracting that would get

477
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:37,230
seclusion is that this B represents the. Nonzero

478
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,560
void is occupied by each of the particles and the

479
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:44,840
gas, which then has to be subtracted from the

480
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,110
total amount of space, the total volume that the

481
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:52,920
gas particles have available to themselves. To to

482
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,310
explore and bounce around the.

483
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,560
So that's a fairly simple modification, the change

484
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:04,600
in the pressure is a little bit trickier to.

485
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,680
To get a handle on it, particularly the fact that

486
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,810
it depends on the density squared, is that the

487
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:19,380
correction is a bit so small to say that this is

488
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:25,000
not Zeltzer model. That we can propose to to

489
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:28,980
analyze interacting gases and their phase

490
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,220
transition to the liquid phase where what's going

491
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:38,040
on this term is that as the density increases, the

492
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,280
particles, if it's volume, are going to be closer

493
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,710
to each other and their interactions, we can see

494
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:47,180
what going to be. More likely to produce those

495
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:51,230
large, repulsive forces that keep the particles

496
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:55,280
from occupying the same space. So as those

497
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,870
particles are packed more closely together,

498
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,360
they're exerting forces on each other, pushing

499
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,410
each other apart. And that pushing is the same

500
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:07,070
sort of force that we started off with to derive

501
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:10,940
the concept of pressure so that this independent

502
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:15,010
effect gets added to the pressure in this

503
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:20,450
vanderpoel's equation space as a second deviation

504
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:24,720
from the ideal gas. So. There's obviously no

505
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,810
detail, derivation or calculation going into all

506
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,650
that. It's just some physically motivated

507
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,580
argumentation.

508
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:39,650
This these two modifications are sufficient for

509
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:44,360
this equation of states to correctly describe the

510
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:49,360
existence of a phase transition between liquidy

511
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:54,220
gas phases, one with a. Zero permissibility,

512
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,250
another with a larger capacity and similarly with

513
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:03,150
different values, the density. Now, the details of.

514
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,820
That phase transition and the properties of. The

515
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,610
press's influence on either side of it are not

516
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:15,250
very accurately described by the variables

517
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,680
equation of states in that sense. Somewhat similar

518
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,940
to the bean field approximation, or at least of

519
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,250
dimensions be correctly predicted, it was a phase

520
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,030
transition of the critical experience that came

521
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:35,380
out of field analysis were incorrect by

522
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,200
significant factors in the case of two or three

523
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,830
dimensions.

524
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,210
From the analysis of liquid gas disquisition,

525
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,200
based on the Vanderwal equation of states, we can

526
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,900
do that same sort of analysis, find the critical

527
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,230
temperature and predict the set of critical

528
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,020
exponents governing the behavior of observables in

529
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,290
the system around that critical temperature.

530
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,870
This is a second order of transition that is

531
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,600
predicted by the federal secretary of state and if

532
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,100
we look at the inverse of the density. And the

533
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:18,710
difference between the imprecisely and the cash

534
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,180
space and the liquid phase, this is something that

535
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,090
needs to vanish at that transition, that that's

536
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,700
equal. And. At temperatures slightly below that,

537
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:33,400
his transition, if you were to. Consider the.

538
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,700
Destitution, the two phases, we would find that

539
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,880
they depended on the temperature. In terms of the

540
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,260
critical experience of the half, which is close

541
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:51,600
but not quite the value that it can be measured in

542
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,300
physical experiments looking at the densities. Of

543
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,550
these objects, not just for liquid water, boiling

544
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,350
steam before any liquid gas phase transition and

545
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:10,330
even more, well, various other quantities that

546
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,440
mercury alcohol. Do you think that has a dash

547
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:19,390
space actually has the same critical explosion be

548
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,850
just under a third independent of precisely what

549
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:29,440
molecules are showing up in this liquid, this gas?

550
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:38,750
So it is a. Remarkable fact that this critical

551
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,020
examiner describing the details of this transition

552
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:47,070
does not depend on. What molecules are the

553
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:52,450
quantities being condensed to oil? But the even

554
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:56,790
more surprising bit is that most people want to be

555
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,690
that provisos when looking at the densities of

556
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,340
liquid gas. His transition is exactly the same

557
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,630
value just under the theory that we found for the

558
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:14,160
magnetization, ferromagnetic transition in the

559
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,790
easy model, in three dimensions on the simple to

560
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:18,570
replace.

561
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,560
It's tempting to suppose that this may just be a

562
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,370
coincidence. I will just tell you to read the

563
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:32,560
section that it is not just a coincidence, there

564
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:32,920
are.

565
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,230
A full set of critical expenses, depending on

566
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,360
which. Observables, we consider it to be a

567
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:45,720
transition that can be computed to many more

568
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,230
significant figures than I've put down here, and

569
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:53,790
in all cases they match up precisely between both

570
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:58,240
that fairly easy transition and the liquid gas

571
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,560
phase transition. And this is. Exactly, the

572
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:08,200
universality that's. We started off this we

573
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,280
started off to motivate this discussion with

574
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,500
regards to this transition.

575
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:17,990
So we can appreciate what universality means that

576
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:22,220
these two completely different systems, a three

577
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,740
dimensional model of interacting spins.

578
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:30,610
And the liquid gas based position will water or

579
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:35,890
any other substance are governed by exactly the

580
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:42,080
same set of critical exponents? Even though the

581
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,340
systems have no connection to each other, there's

582
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:49,260
no way we can model a bunch of H2O molecules, as

583
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:53,610
is expensive L.A. and vice versa. But despite that.

584
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,330
The phase transitions that the systems have

585
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:02,950
behaved exactly the same way as governed by their

586
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:06,360
set of critical exponents around the phase

587
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,950
transition in this particular set of critical

588
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:14,940
exponents defines. What has become known as the

589
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:19,170
universality class, and you can learn a great deal

590
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:24,600
about any given patronization, any system just by

591
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,750
determining what universality class. This

592
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,450
transition belongs to that immediately tells you

593
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:34,900
all the most critical explanations of how various

594
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,710
observables behave vicinity of that phase position.

595
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,570
So that's what universality is, where it comes

596
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:47,260
from is beyond the scope of this model of what it

597
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,210
would be, a focus of a.

598
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,710
Second graduate level follow, of course, if we

599
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,340
were to offer.

600
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,820
This is. The derivation of universality, the

601
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,480
explanation of how and why it can occur in these

602
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,120
physical systems was developed largely in the

603
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:12,110
1960s and 70s and some important names in that

604
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:16,940
process. Of course, there more the prominent folks

605
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,260
include Michael Fisher, the catastrophic Nillson,

606
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,310
of whom only Ken Wilson was awarded the Nobel

607
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:29,780
Prize for this work in the early 80s. And in fact,

608
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:35,000
at the time, he objected to being the only one

609
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:39,620
recognized say that all three of them should have.

610
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,370
Should have become the lawyers for the.

611
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:49,810
Developments of what is called the reorganization

612
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:53,080
group, even though it's not a group that explains

613
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,470
universality and how it rises. The takeaway

614
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,620
message that was then justified by the work of

615
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,500
these folks this year, Kenneth Wilson and others,

616
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:11,470
was that. The large scale behavior of statistical

617
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:14,500
systems and the interactive particles in the

618
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:19,490
vicinity of critical points is insensitive to the

619
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:23,680
details of the underlying systems, the degrees of

620
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,870
freedom that define the different possible

621
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:31,760
microstates. So this is. This can be both a

622
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,730
blessing and a curse this week, we'll see mostly

623
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:37,760
this afternoon when we look at some broader

624
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,990
applications in the review of this module. The

625
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:45,350
fact that the microscopic degrees of freedom may

626
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,110
not matter, gravity transition may be covered by

627
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:51,920
this universal, predictable behavior is one of the

628
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,280
keys that allows simple statistical models like

629
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,500
the easy model to. Really be. Rigorously

630
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,800
applicable in widely different domains.

631
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:11,250
To. Accurately model and describe and predict the

632
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:16,260
behavior of physical systems, from theoretical

633
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:22,680
physics to sociology, epidemiology and more. On

634
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,150
the other hand, there is a downside to

635
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:31,170
universality if we care what those fundamental

636
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:35,430
degrees of freedom are, because if in our physics

637
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:39,060
experiments we are restricted to relatively large,

638
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:43,790
everyday scales, then all that we can see is

639
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,470
universal behavior that could conceivably have

640
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:53,370
arisen from widely different sets of fundamental

641
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:57,650
particles and directions at the. Underlying

642
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:02,640
microscopic level. So this is, for example, why it

643
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,640
is so hard to establish whether or not string

644
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:11,660
theory, maybe the physics that underlies phenomena,

645
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,900
perhaps the sales that we're able to access, even

646
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:19,160
with the Large Hadron Collider proving scales that

647
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,570
are roughly one billion, 10 to minus 15 meters,

648
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,980
that's still large scale compared to the

649
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,880
hypothesized size of fundamental strings that

650
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,260
might be responsible for that scale behavior. But

651
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,440
because that large scale behavior becomes

652
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:43,250
insensitive to the details of the underlying

653
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:46,340
microscopic degrees of freedom that interact to

654
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:51,580
produce it. We can't really say whether or not

655
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:54,520
string theory is responsible for any given

656
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:58,690
observation in these experiments. It's just one of

657
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:03,190
many possibilities that become very hard to to

658
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:04,000
disentangle.

659
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,800
So I think all more or less wrap up there for the

660
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,130
morning, it's a nice place to stop at the end of

661
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:20,440
this section to where we've dealt with the last

662
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:24,370
large scale physics concept of universality that

663
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:28,310
is important to take away from this molecule. And

664
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:33,350
just as a preview for the afternoon, I think a

665
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:36,830
decent use of that final tutorial will be a sort

666
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:40,730
of quick whistle stop tour of various sorts of

667
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:46,610
broader applications of the concepts and tools of

668
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:50,960
statistical physics in other areas of mathematical

669
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,050
sciences represented by other molecules here in

670
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:59,330
Liverpool, as well as some applications far beyond

671
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:03,230
what really considered the mathematical sciences.

672
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,030
So what we talk about a few of those this

673
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,640
afternoon won't say much about them. Just a.

674
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,070
Qualitative discussion of motivation and that

675
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:16,710
could upset some of the power of statistical

676
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:21,630
physics. It's not worth getting into that here.

677
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:26,440
I'll just stop. Wrap up by. Reminding us what

678
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,300
we've looked at to round out the. Real

679
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,250
mathematical content of the course, the important

680
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,950
sampling, what the of the various algorithms that

681
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:38,640
could be defined as to sample microstates

682
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,580
proportional to their unknown probabilities and

683
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:47,670
then the power of universality to make the

684
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,760
predictions coming from these empirical analysis

685
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,570
or other methods very broadly applicable to full

686
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,120
universality classes with completely different

687
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,030
underlying physical degrees of freedom. So are

688
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:03,780
there any questions before we take the break, the

689
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:06,600
meantime, before coming back in the afternoon?

690
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,680
You'll have the chance to ask anything about this

691
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,470
or the module itself the afternoon, so come up

692
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:21,710
with questions or requests for things to cover,

693
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,150
then take care. Until then.
