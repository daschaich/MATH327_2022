00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,070
All right, welcome back to Friday afternoon, the end of the week,

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,640
at least for statistical physics, and the start of

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,970
the end can be the six-digit number for this afternoon:

4
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,910
four seven seven seven five eight.

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,300
And it seems to be

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,950
warm of these days that leaving that window open

7
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,190
isn't going to make things too cold in here. We'll see how we

8
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,600
get on at this point. There are about three

9
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,670
things in the bag for this afternoon. And the idea

10
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,540
is I'll just go straight through them in this

11
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:06,070
order. Starting with a quick look at the computer

12
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,050
project, solutions for feedback on that first part

13
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,370
and a quick look forward to the second part of the

14
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:20,270
week's. That the. Not a trivial exercise that we

15
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,680
got started last week with the mixing of two

16
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,040
different types of otherwise indistinguishable

17
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,230
particles and the resulting mixing entropy when

18
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,970
the systems are combined and separated, and then

19
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:40,880
that everyone outside knows the new and exciting

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,880
tutorial exercise on different sorts of

21
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,050
thermodynamics cycles, a bit more practically

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,110
useful than the current cycle.

23
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,560
And of course, this is far as an opportunity for

24
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,680
you to bring up any questions, have the topics but

25
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,480
the others want to know more about, I have this

26
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,250
bottom on the screen, very focused and.

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,650
Not hearing any urgent questions coming up,

28
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,600
make a few quick comments about the solutions to

29
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,440
this first part of the computer project, probably

30
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,030
just looking at the plots that we have dispersed,

31
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,320
exercises calling the. Particular type of function,

32
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,270
random, random, to generate the security number

33
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,470
many times and then manipulating those results to

34
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,910
check the average standard deviation of a fairly

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,170
trivial uniform distribution. Maybe the

36
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,410
interesting thing about this is that when we look

37
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:05,240
at how the fluctuations of our estimates for. The

38
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,860
meaning of that uniform distribution from the law

39
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,240
of large numbers. The fluctuations around the true

40
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,500
Analytica mean.

41
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,910
Can be computed by repeating that estimation many

42
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:27,760
times and then checking that. The difference

43
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,020
between this estimate from the law of large

44
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,320
numbers and the true meaning, it's closer to.

45
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,090
Proportionately to this one, overall, the number

46
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,580
of repetitions somebody.

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,880
Numerically verifying something that you saw in

48
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,780
class, namely that. The. Number of repetitions

49
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,490
times, the deviation between the arithmetic mean

50
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,600
and the true meaning is a constant. And in

51
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,050
particular, this counts. It turns out to be, as we

52
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,710
derived in class, just the variance of the

53
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,830
distribution in this case, what, twelve point

54
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,930
three that's plotted on. But as the solid orange

55
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,040
line compared to the numerical estimates and the

56
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,590
number of repetitions being used in this analysis

57
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,020
increased by a factor of ten thousand the.

58
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,300
That should be a consequence, as are increases

59
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,630
from ten to one hundred thousand is just bouncing

60
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,230
around within 10 to 20 percent of the expected

61
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:49,830
value. Exercise to sort of looking at a

62
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,890
non-trivial distribution related. To that uniform

63
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,970
distribution by the arc, Simon. Inversed transform,

64
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:06,740
sampling this exercise was. The easiest one for

65
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,640
most folks, it's another computation of the exact

66
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,570
mean and standard deviation of this non-trivial

67
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,320
distribution, and some of you could check that. So

68
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,200
the probability distribution you can derive.

69
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,640
Random variables distributed, according to their

70
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:39,810
cosign, that the limits. On the range of. X is

71
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,430
looking at this kind of stuff, what I needed to

72
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,100
have the integral over probability distribution

73
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,600
itself add up two to one snippet of X, the X

74
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,550
equals one, given the limits of minus six to six.

75
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,040
And this is an automatic consequence of. Setting

76
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,080
up this distribution through that inversed

77
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,580
transform sampling already released to the uniform

78
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,440
distribution where the probability. More

79
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,200
critically, it adds up to a larger percentage of

80
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,230
these inevitable transformations, preserve that

81
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:27,240
total probability. So that's. The basic properties

82
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,530
of. The probability are satisfied by any

83
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:35,630
distribution obtained through the sample. And as I

84
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,030
said, this was the. Exercise is the easiest for

85
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,530
most folks who got a nice agreement between the

86
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,520
cosine of X that solitaries line and the

87
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,860
normalized Vistaprint. Running from minus six to

88
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,970
six. With a million samples that can be computer

89
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,830
generated in about five seconds, this facility is

90
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,540
exercise three, which was the more challenging one.

91
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,050
And maybe the main challenge we're talking about

92
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,310
here in person is just the amount of computing

93
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,530
time that it is going to be done over there that

94
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:33,350
some folks reported needing to invest in order to

95
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,540
come up with this part of the. Diffusion length,

96
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,020
as estimated from the ballpark numbers, the

97
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,380
arithmetic mean of the diffusion line for ten

98
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,000
thousand samples for every and the number of steps

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,420
in the walk ranging from a single step walk. All

100
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,310
the way up to walks of five hundred steps. And the

101
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:08,160
trick that helps this competition run a bit faster

102
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:13,020
in about 20 seconds on my laptop, 40 seconds on

103
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,440
the clock. Is hinted at in the demo, which is to

104
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,460
note that if we go through the trouble of

105
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,940
computing this final points, ten thousand

106
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,510
different marks, each of five hundred steps in the

107
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,200
first four hundred ninety nine steps of that five

108
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,350
hundred step will give us ten thousand four

109
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,710
hundred ninety nine steps already lied about. And

110
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,710
the first steps are all the hundreds of works that

111
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,570
we need and all the way across here. Now,

112
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:53,430
obviously, this has the. Effect that. The five

113
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,800
hundred step walks only differ from the four

114
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,120
hundred by the Knights that walks by that last

115
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,950
single step, which is part of the reason why the

116
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:07,190
data in blue are. So smooth in this result and

117
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:13,040
ignore those correlations was the time to be in

118
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,060
the exercise that allowed it to run in the 20

119
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:23,270
seconds as opposed to 20 minutes. How do you have

120
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:23,720
to.

121
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,920
Fit this comparison on the screen.

122
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,290
So the. Far to the left here is the same one we

123
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,350
were just looking at figures out its focus again,

124
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,930
where we ignored the correlations between all of

125
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,320
these lots of different number of steps and just

126
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,070
use the five hundred step walk as the source of

127
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:56,010
all the shorter walks. If we repeat that, the cost

128
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,720
of one hundred times more computing than what we

129
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,500
can see by having them side by side like this is a

130
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,810
greater amount of. Sarcastic scatter around the

131
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,760
fit. So getting this to the square root of N.

132
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:19,820
That.

133
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,820
Hide the fact that the data points in blue are

134
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
bouncing around.

135
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,460
To a greater magnitude above and below that, if I

136
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:41,380
wanted to write about. Zoom in on. The

137
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,130
uncharitably bought the plot showing uncorrelated

138
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:52,520
results. Mr.. Make that a bit clearer to see the

139
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,000
effect of those correlations and smoothing out

140
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,900
that behavior. So if we were being.

141
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,930
Very careful about estimating uncertainties in

142
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,570
things like the coefficients of these and

143
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,270
predictions for physics, we might want to worry

144
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,900
about those correlations. That's. Something that.

145
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,840
We don't need to tell a lot of effort into you for

146
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,980
the purposes of this exercise, just confirming the

147
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,120
expected security independence is sufficient for

148
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,320
our purposes.

149
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,720
And.

150
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,330
One other comment is that. If you want to look at

151
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,880
this difference between correlated, uncorrelated

152
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,690
results in more detail, a nice way to do that,

153
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,110
which I have set up today, is to. Look at what he

154
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,230
call the residuals of profits. So take the

155
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,330
difference between each data point and the Fifth

156
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,380
and the corresponding value, and I plot those

157
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,630
versus then you'll see results that sarcastically

158
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,350
fluctuate. Ground Zero saw some data points are

159
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,720
higher than the feds, some are lower than the

160
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,270
average. And the scale of those fluctuations is

161
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,730
going to. Decrease as the number of repetitions

162
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,650
are increases and it's going to be larger than the

163
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,840
Oncolytics compared with these smooth correlated

164
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,530
results where the fluctuations that we get for

165
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,820
five hundred steps in the war are going to depend

166
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,540
almost entirely on those that come out for

167
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,000
that stuff box. So those are all the.

168
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,950
I had to say about that first part of the computer

169
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:57,290
exercise there, any questions? About that. Before

170
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,950
just a quick walk through the next piece of that.

171
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:10,130
The.

172
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,480
Yeah, so in the PDF that I have on the screen here,

173
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,280
I copy the

174
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,310
companies that were used. This is an example I

175
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,120
found that I used to produce the American response

176
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,700
and the plots that I was showing. And this is also

177
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,020
on the Candace page, linked from the same

178
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,520
discussion where the solutions themselves are long

179
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:50,600
from. So it may well be worth spending 30 seconds.

180
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,130
Whether you can find all of that.

181
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,040
Sloane.

182
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,640
Two factor authentication is part of the reason

183
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,770
they have so upset the student, beaten up the

184
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,690
immersive reader.

185
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,450
So this should be what you see on canvas.

186
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,390
From the stream, there is an update on the

187
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,480
computer project on the bottom of here, we have

188
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,090
the link to the PDF and at least my model python

189
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,840
code. That is not the only or necessarily the best

190
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,840
way to do things, but gives an example of how all

191
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:14,110
of these numerical results and figures were

192
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,950
produced in the stated amount of time

193
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:27,360
printout just to keep an eye on both sides, asking

194
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,510
you to work on all of these missiles.

195
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:42,690
So that is. Where you can find all of that and.

196
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,180
Further questions about. That part one.

197
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,490
Also, just a few comments and a quick walk through

198
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:03,980
now, part to highlight a few things, not go into

199
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,910
an exhaustive discussion of everything that's

200
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,470
going on.

201
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,920
So this is a continuation of the project that is

202
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:21,680
going to. Build on what you've done. One to. Bring

203
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,290
things to bear on a slightly more complicated

204
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,890
situation, so we're still looking at random walks

205
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,720
with step sizes that are randomly chosen from a

206
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,840
particular distribution and. In this case.

207
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,900
Rather than starting from the transform, taking us

208
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,640
from the uniform distribution to the distribution

209
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,270
of interest from which we'll build up the works of

210
00:16:54,270 --> 00:17:00,060
what analyzed and to start off with defining. That

211
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,810
distribution, which is known as a commercial

212
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,450
distribution or personal wealth distribution or

213
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,570
Brainfeeder distribution, depending on what

214
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,620
textbook you're reading, what Wikipedia article

215
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,350
you're looking at.

216
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,930
But this is is an overall normalization factor,

217
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,190
one over five times subcouncil parameter B.

218
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:35,680
Times the. Fraction one divided by one plus. The

219
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,870
ex Overbey squared, and this rages over all real

220
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,470
ex positive and negative, it's an even functional

221
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:49,750
around. Exit zero is it depends on the square root

222
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,450
of the square root of X.

223
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,510
And.

224
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,340
The maybe the best way to. Did some intuition for.

225
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,890
This distribution is just to look at it plotted

226
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,250
for a few different values of the parameter of the

227
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,290
compared to the normal Gaussian distribution with

228
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,750
a with a sigma of of one so that Gaussian

229
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:28,240
distribution is the solid black curve in this plot.

230
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,110
And then the other three curve's. The red dashkova

231
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:40,660
hyping the solid green curve with the peak fairly

232
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,390
close to navigation distribution and then the

233
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,490
lower and broader.

234
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,940
Got a blue curve are three different realizations

235
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,040
that Kosmaj distribution with different values,

236
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:02,640
black has to be either a half, one or two. All of

237
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,450
these cases,

238
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,730
the most noteworthy thing about these

239
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,410
distributions is that for a sufficiently large X

240
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:18,270
in magnitude, so plus or minus X often for the

241
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,540
edges of this plot, we see that even in the case

242
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,370
of a small B, where the peak and the probability

243
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,670
distribution around X equals zero can greatly

244
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,510
exceed the peak of the Gaussian distribution.

245
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,520
Eventually.

246
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,130
Even after all of these distributions following

247
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,090
the election were sufficiently large X. The

248
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,930
Gaussian distribution is the lowest of all, and

249
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:53,550
any cautions against distribution is going to have

250
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:57,530
probabilities at large acts that are larger than

251
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:04,160
that of the distribution. Which is. Easy to

252
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,880
appreciate simply because the distribution. Eataly,

253
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,780
minus X squared is decreasing exponentially in X

254
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,510
squared. There is the distribution of the driving

255
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:24,810
down by this factor of one over X squared. So an

256
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,200
exponential suppression is always going to beat

257
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:32,380
any polynomial suppression for a sufficiently

258
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:39,660
large values of X. And what this is known as or

259
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:46,670
referred to are tales in the distribution. It's a

260
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,710
statement that the probabilities for. Large

261
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,900
volumes of excellent details of the distribution

262
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,150
far away from connecting with zero.

263
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,850
The probability of those and the disintegration is

264
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,830
greater than or fatter than that of the normal

265
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:06,900
distribution.

266
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:16,640
And in the course of the. First exercise in this

267
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,710
part of the assignment, which is the fourth

268
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,140
exercise overall. We'll see some of the features

269
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,190
of that coherence distribution, which motivates

270
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,210
the. Introduction of generalized diffusion length

271
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:38,240
and the following final exercise. Maybe I should

272
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,860
start on its previous page three by picking up on

273
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,040
the discussion of these battles in the course of

274
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,750
the rest distribution, which. Mean mathematically

275
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,620
that there is a lower probability for rare events

276
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,380
far away from peak to occur. Compare it again to

277
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,720
the normal distribution. So an illustration of

278
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,110
what this means in practice is what I initially

279
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,100
put up here at the top of this page comparing two

280
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,330
different random walks in two dimensions. So here,

281
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:19,110
in addition to randomly choosing the step size,

282
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:23,250
you also randomly choose a direction, the plane

283
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,480
for the water to step. And that's not just to get

284
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,840
something visual to to look at

285
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:39,280
the. Figure on the left here, the step sizes are

286
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,930
being chosen from a national distribution.

287
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,820
And if we trace all out the path of this random

288
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,300
water to take its steps, we see that as randomly

289
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,930
choosing different directions in step lengths to

290
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,740
proceed in this two dimensional plane and filling

291
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:08,180
in. Some portion of that played around with the.

292
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,570
Border. Ten to 20 units from that starting point

293
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,390
at the origin, zero zero.

294
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,630
And.

295
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,700
I'm sure you've already seen the contrast to.

296
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,810
The other men to walk on the plots where the

297
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:39,750
planes are drawn. But the to Lorenz distribution,

298
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,690
rather than the actual distribution and the. Fat

299
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,960
tails in that distribution are caused by

300
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,820
occasional steps that have much larger sizes than

301
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:59,430
anything seen in the case, so that the scale of

302
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:04,470
the accidents has seen by a factor of 10. Even

303
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,880
with that. That Zuma out some of the individual

304
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,520
steps are far larger than anything that is

305
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,650
produced by a U.S. distribution with any

306
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,370
probability.

307
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,980
In this situation, it turns out to be necessary

308
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,370
for reasons the seeding exercise force, you define

309
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,480
a generalized diffusion length rather than looking

310
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,420
at that L2 in the first part of the computer

311
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,110
project, the distribution is also theta.

312
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,960
You mentioned that in the case where the mean is

313
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,400
zero, which is the case for all of these

314
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,910
distributions that are even around X equals zero,

315
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:00,190
if we set Theta to two, we would recover just the

316
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,800
usual diffusion length standard deviation as

317
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,850
opposed to here L2. That was part of the first

318
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,450
part of the computer project and the ordinary log

319
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,770
diffusion that this elsom that is proportional to

320
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,880
the square root and for walks and steps for the

321
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:27,490
distribution. The only valid values of theta are

322
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,690
data from zero to one. So it has to be a positive

323
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,960
quantity and the portion of its distribution, this

324
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,990
generalized, if you like, that still define if

325
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:46,800
Theta is ever. One of the larger. And the question

326
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,510
then is, how do you pay for this distribution of

327
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,610
these journalists, if you like, severity with the

328
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,640
number of steps to walk, so give him some.

329
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,980
Exponents Alpha.

330
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,700
Which in the case of ordinary diffusion,

331
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,380
corresponds to. The square root circle is a half.

332
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,050
Whatever the law of diffusion.

333
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:22,930
Satisfied? And final exercise for you to do is

334
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,950
figure out Alpha for the distribution, see whether

335
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,680
it is a half. Larger than a half produces, but

336
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,360
it's a super supervision that's similar to the

337
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,500
system up here, but we can also have halfa still

338
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,950
positive. That's more than half the produce and

339
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:49,400
subterfuge of random walks. That's. Move away from

340
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,770
their starting point much more slowly than

341
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:59,130
diffusion. Would forget. So they've gone on, I

342
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:03,620
have got to wonder about all of that, the media

343
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:08,580
questions before you get to work on this next

344
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,380
assignment, the knowledgeable.

345
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,660
There are a couple of weeks left to play with that

346
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:33,080
you can now. Return to your problems more

347
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,620
explicitly and starting with the one we got part

348
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,380
of the way through last time around, looking at

349
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,720
the mixing entropy for the simplification. We

350
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,350
assume that all of the particles of these gases

351
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,100
are indistinguishable apart from your color, red

352
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,240
or blue. And you want to see how the entropy of

353
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,840
these systems various through the three stage

354
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,570
process of starting off with the initial

355
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:10,720
separation due to. Different containers with all

356
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,330
the red particles are going to take it all the

357
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:21,940
particles. So that was interesting challenge the

358
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:27,850
lectures, elections and two

359
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,590
more is there. And on that one, there is just two

360
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:36,970
as.

361
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,490
This volume divided by.

362
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,360
And then upon removing the wall separating these

363
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,120
two systems of law, but it was a part of this mix.

364
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:07,890
Last time you computed the entropy, that combined

365
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:12,690
system was not shown in these figures and saw that

366
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:17,760
it is equal to an initial review by the courts to

367
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,380
avoid the ratio. Plus, your positive mixing

368
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:33,250
entropy that we to do to add more to the. And it

369
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:39,120
depends on the volume. And then we ran out of time.

370
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,220
And left it as something for you to think about

371
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,550
what happens when the ball is reinserted, that

372
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:53,000
combined system is re separated into two systems,

373
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,870
which you can assume have the same number of

374
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:01,100
particles, but in general will have red and blue

375
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,640
particles now scramble together on different sides

376
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,780
of this wall.

377
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,910
So if you have any luck finding an expression for

378
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,810
how the interviewee behaves in that.

379
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:24,580
Final stage where the ball has been inserted and

380
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,340
the right of the particles are all scrambled.

381
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:39,740
Sounds like the.

382
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:49,580
Almost intractable. Which motivates going through

383
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,430
it here and now in person.

384
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,110
Let's see

385
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,770
how much time to spend on this. The first step

386
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:09,770
that is even being mentioned in this problem is

387
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,050
that we just need to compute this partition

388
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:15,830
function of that final system once this law has

389
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:21,720
been reinserted. So. To go through that very

390
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,130
quickly, this is always a.

391
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:32,930
It's based on the civil protection functions. So

392
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:33,710
that's where that

393
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,820
ratio of.

394
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,130
Particles come from a wall to the single particle

395
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,550
protection function for everything else you wrote

396
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:53,890
down in class was just the sheer the volume of the

397
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:54,700
particles in

398
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:01,850
several different wavelengths and then for an

399
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,790
indistinguishable from the. So that this is the

400
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,190
one.

401
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,130
Partition is just the single market opportunity.

402
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,990
However, it is divided in different ways of living.

403
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:26,940
It's probably the single. Indistinguishably posted

404
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,190
in the. System of particles.

405
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,100
The case will probably be solved, at least one to

406
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:45,120
the end is just as important for the same the

407
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:49,370
girls. So the question now is, if we have these

408
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:53,990
two separate containers with a mixture of red and

409
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,860
blue particles.

410
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,130
What is the overall function for ximo

411
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:08,780
for difference in this initial gases? We have the

412
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,870
red particles in the container particles in what

413
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,990
container particles were a container of particles

414
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:19,430
of the right container. So if we suppose that

415
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:24,950
there are new particles in the left container,

416
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:32,480
then for factors to multiply together. So for

417
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:39,440
those particles, that horrible times, that's a

418
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,900
particle vacation function. So.

419
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:54,590
We want you to know that our assumption is that

420
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,130
there are in total particles in each container.

421
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:07,160
One is very important with this container. So

422
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:20,540
one to see this all, it's more defined by the

423
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:24,830
remaining red particles in the right container. We

424
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,730
know there are a lot of those

425
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:35,810
in the particles, a total of four of them left in

426
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,100
the.

427
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,600
And there are things like this new container

428
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,410
is

429
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,210
in that.

430
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:04,730
So those are the four factors going into the

431
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:08,760
petition function for any particular number of red

432
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,900
particles in the container, which determines all

433
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,230
of the other particles are distributed among those

434
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:18,440
containers. This can be simplified.

435
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:29,110
Fairly directly, just by. Seeing that. He has. How

436
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:35,140
is it you can correct me on those terms so we the

437
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:42,670
two factors at the end two, but one of the factors

438
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,230
that were involved in so many

439
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:56,860
times,

440
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,470
both

441
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,010
what we want to end.

442
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,640
Calling

443
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,170
for

444
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,030
political.

445
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:23,890
Well,

446
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:29,660
see that the denominator here, that's just what we

447
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:34,160
have to do, right? This is one over

448
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:41,220
square Times Square by

449
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,090
you.

450
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,410
So that is protection for one particular

451
00:36:55,410 --> 00:37:01,250
distribution and. We have to some this over all

452
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:08,750
possible numbers of red particles that came up in

453
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,470
the left container. There can be no particles

454
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:16,460
there, one or two or all of the particles. And

455
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:24,950
when something goes all the way up to the end of

456
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,920
that, you just disappear.

457
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,900
Which that is of

458
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:37,400
where.

459
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,110
It was worth

460
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,810
it to me.

461
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,260
Half

462
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:56,920
of the

463
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:05,400
square, which was given to that this fall, some.

464
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,930
As a result, more than seven years ago, so this

465
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:20,350
one is down to the final four when she was on.

466
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:23,500
So.

467
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:34,890
If you want to be in the final stage, play a

468
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,990
little trick to simplify calculations, it's the

469
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:41,820
same trick as we talked about last week. The

470
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:48,070
difference between the comparison to the interview

471
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,080
of the divine system,

472
00:38:52,350 --> 00:39:01,780
one that came out, which is. The mother of the

473
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,530
ratio of. That story

474
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:13,560
just repeated the bipartisan policy, which was

475
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:22,280
last week. What we have right now, from the work

476
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,910
to the bottom, there is little.

477
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:36,160
As to the other side, this is one of the fairly

478
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,880
complicated.

479
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,900
Expression.

480
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,950
What we have is the final state

481
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,150
where.

482
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:04,940
And then there were politicians and over again,

483
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:08,550
this is all divided by. The

484
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:17,160
most popular politician there. Well, I don't want

485
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,490
to question.

486
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:32,140
Factor. So everything is canceling out except for

487
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:35,660
more

488
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,780
than a minus

489
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,910
or two.

490
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,130
Now we can.

491
00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:00,540
So for your services, what was the bottom

492
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,230
line, is this

493
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,160
for real small?

494
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:26,700
Well, without the war support, it's useless to

495
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:32,090
try to minus two

496
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,360
plus.

497
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:43,390
To there, cancellations, anything except

498
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:51,610
school that cancels out that factor to zero.

499
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,390
So.

500
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:07,610
Once we reinsert the ball in the system and we

501
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:13,410
separate the combined system into two. Subsystems

502
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:16,270
with the same number of particles and scramble

503
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:19,800
colors, the entropy of the universe does not go

504
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,800
back to the smaller value that we started off with.

505
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:26,610
It also doesn't increase. It just stays the same

506
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:31,710
as it was in that combined system, which is in

507
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:36,180
agreement with the second law of thermodynamics as

508
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,080
time goes on

509
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:44,340
and is created as equal to the interview, which we

510
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,580
thought was certainly greater than the start of

511
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:51,330
entropy. So this procedure have been able to

512
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:56,010
confirm explicitly does not violate the second law

513
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,690
of thermodynamics.

514
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:09,270
So that is. All to say, you have to say about last

515
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:12,120
week's mixing entropy problem, unless there are

516
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,000
questions about it. A fun exercise you might do

517
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:22,920
going forward is with the next corrections and

518
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:26,850
formula and see if you can explain what happens.

519
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,890
Order, order, mortgage terms are preserved.

520
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,320
And it looks like there is just time remaining to

521
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:45,450
mention the. Final topic that I thought would be

522
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,700
the bulk of activity today, which is looking at

523
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,310
different thermodynamic cycles.

524
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,340
Beyond the cycle that we finish talking about

525
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:08,650
Monday. This is an example known as the auto cycle,

526
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:16,150
named after a German physicist, Nicholas Otto, who

527
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,820
spent about 14 years in the eighteen sixties and

528
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,060
seventies trying to figure out how to actually

529
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,430
build the machine that would realize this pressure

530
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,280
volume diagram. So let's walk through the four

531
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,990
stages of the cycle. And figure out. What it is

532
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:40,290
doing and maybe the best way to. Motivates the

533
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:44,610
four stages here is to reveal from the start that

534
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:49,350
this is an idealized description of how a petrol

535
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:55,300
engine works. So starting from this point, one man

536
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:01,090
and a boy you visible the gas in this cycle is

537
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:04,810
typically some mixture of air and vaporized petrol

538
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,780
that is compressed idiomatically.

539
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:16,610
To a smaller volume, you point to that compression

540
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:21,080
raises the temperature of this petrol air mixture.

541
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,280
At which point that high pressure, high

542
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:29,860
temperature, the spark is introduced to that gas,

543
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,460
which lights it on fire, it ignites the gas and

544
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:37,720
essentially uses that. The burning of this gas is

545
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,820
a replacement for an external hot reservoir of the

546
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:46,030
sort that Cardno had in mind. So rather than

547
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,420
waiting to exchange energy with an external

548
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:53,940
High-temperature reservoir, William. Ignite the

549
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,020
fuel, burn it, extract heat from it to drive up

550
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:02,820
the temperature and pressure at a fixed value for

551
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:07,230
the volume, and then once the pressure is up here

552
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,930
at its maximum point thirty, we use that pressure

553
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:17,320
to extract work from the engine. So. We allow the

554
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:22,480
system to expand again and also idiomatically with

555
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:29,290
the expansion at constant entropy that can do work,

556
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:33,480
extract power from the the burning of the fuel,

557
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,940
and then that takes us to this final stage where

558
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,790
we're back at the boy we started off with. But we

559
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,950
still have a significantly higher temperature

560
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:45,370
after having gone through the process of dumping

561
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:49,300
in a bunch of heat into this gas by letting it out,

562
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:55,370
fire burning it off. And this exhausts stage is a

563
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:59,630
similarly clever way of rapidly reducing the

564
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:04,860
temperature and the pressure at a fixed volume. So

565
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,960
what happens here is that rather than demanding

566
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,360
that the same end particles in the gas remain in

567
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:16,750
the gas throughout this whole cycle, those hot and

568
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:20,420
particles of the fuel are expelled to the

569
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:24,290
atmosphere as exhaust. And at the same time

570
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:28,070
they're replaced by an equal amount of tresh

571
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:33,050
cooler fuel air mixture so that the process back

572
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,410
to the starting points and repeats over and over

573
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:40,370
again, often several thousand revolutions per

574
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:44,270
minute, and the sorts of petrol engines that we

575
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:47,240
have on the streets nowadays, we thought it would

576
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,330
be in to be able to make anything quite so

577
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:54,890
advanced is what's driving our cars on. His

578
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,340
realization of this cycle had about two or four

579
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:02,570
percent efficiency and was about 10 feet tall. It

580
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:05,840
was a fellow named Dimler who figured out how to

581
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:10,590
actually. Shrink things down to the point where

582
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,380
the engines were movable, didn't have to be set up

583
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:17,600
in a specialized lavatory, which is why Dimler

584
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:21,610
does not want to be. Most established car

585
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:28,350
companies in that in the world. And given the time

586
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:31,550
it was just through the states, the tutorial

587
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:36,470
problems surrounding this obviously go and revisit

588
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:39,590
it next time around, zoom in a bit.

589
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,080
So we went through this cycle and did one last

590
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:50,400
thing to define is the compression ratio, which is

591
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,720
just the ratio of the larger volume to the smaller.

592
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:58,560
So something that is greater than one which is

593
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,010
relevant because the efficiency of the cycle

594
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:06,610
depends only on that compression ratio. The ratio

595
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,110
of the volumes at which the compression starts and

596
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:14,460
where it ends. So the task which you can think

597
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:18,570
about all over the coming week is to compute the

598
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:23,130
efficiency of a petrol engine compared to the

599
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:28,230
current cycle and figure out which one is most

600
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:31,680
efficient and how that efficiency can be maximized.

601
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:36,750
So you will discuss that next week. And hopefully

602
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,300
in the meantime, you can have some fun thinking

603
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,730
about how that calculation might go on. Any final

604
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,780
questions for today? Feel free to shout about now.

605
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:52,380
Otherwise, see you back here Monday afternoon for

606
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,610
quantum statistics. Completely different.

607
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:14,880
At

608
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:19,840
this

609
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:23,280
point,

610
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:25,870
oil

611
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:28,730
is.

612
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:50,190
Stop that recording.
