1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,700
All right, the bells have finished and I've got the

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,900
recording going so we may as well get under way, at

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:18,600
least to put up the six digit number for this afternoon, which is

4
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,830
five, six, one, nine, four, four.

5
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,280
So, welcome back, now to the second half of the term, starting both a new

6
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:45,980
week, approaching spring, and a new unit, which is

7
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,260
probably a good point to

8
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,320
pause a bit and check in with the plan for at

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,960
least the next few weeks leading up to the term break forf this

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:05,810
module. So, we are here on the fourteenth of March, and the

11
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,310
overall plan---

12
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,560
we are where we're headed at the moment---is to

13
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:23,790
take the grand-canonical ensemble, the third and final

14
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,730
statistical ensemble that we. Went through the

15
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,380
definition and foundation of last week and combine

16
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,080
that with quantum statistics.

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,470
To investigate the behavior of quantum ideal gases

18
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,210
that the particles.

19
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,030
Onto my guess is what's on the screen ideal,

20
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,090
meaning that the particles opposing this gas are

21
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,370
not interacting with each other just the way we

22
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,610
solve for classical ideal gases in the framework

23
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,400
of the canonical ensemble. A few weeks back, a

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,150
year before. So over the past week, we dealt with

25
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,080
the introduction of the grand canonical example.

26
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,300
So this is the system where the probability space

27
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,910
was microstates, as defined by the possible

28
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:31,070
configurations of the particles in the system as

29
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,790
it evolves through time. And now, in contrast to

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,990
the micro, canonical and grand canonical examples

31
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:44,640
that we developed, first, the energy. The number

32
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,790
are both allowed to fluctuate and they fluctuate

33
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,030
by being exchanged with a large external particle

34
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:01,050
reservoir that fixes to complementary qualities in

35
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,450
this approach the temperature.

36
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,750
The chemical potential.

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,330
I kept fixed by that large external reservoir

38
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,860
and then we went through the same sort of.

39
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,350
Construction for the grand ensemble, as we did

40
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,010
earlier from the canonical ensemble, looking at

41
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:28,910
the.

42
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,160
Protection function.

43
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,310
That is the. Fundamental. Object in this approach

44
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,640
from which everything else can be derived. The

45
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,270
resulting potential for land of free energy that

46
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,840
capital find in this negative negativity holds the

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,680
log of energy. And then from that particular

48
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,400
derivatives of this potential, we get our usual.

49
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,700
Observables. The internal energy.

50
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,910
The entropy now, the particle, no.

51
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,150
As quantities that.

52
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,660
We can derive on the basis of the partition

53
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,860
function. And relations between all of them

54
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,940
through that general estimate indicate that. And

55
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,320
the second step in the overarching plan for the

56
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,870
next few weeks is to add to this grand council the.

57
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,790
Statistics of quantum physics, without actually

58
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,720
having to bring in or assume knowledge of any

59
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,110
quantum physics, would just take it as nonsense.

60
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,810
How? Approach the definition of these systems,

61
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,750
which will turn out to be the way that we operate

62
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,650
in practice, but before you dive into that, having

63
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,060
an overview of. The large scale plan and some of

64
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,580
the details that we dealt with last week, are

65
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,870
there any questions about where we are or what the

66
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,940
next steps are going to be?

67
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,190
They're eager to see something new in terms of

68
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,440
quantum statistics, which is again being

69
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,990
introduced. In this unit, so this is another

70
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,980
definition of foundation heavy unit that will find

71
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,610
its application to systems by the gases in the

72
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,590
coming unit in combination with the canonical

73
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,660
ensemble. And.

74
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,140
I should start off by saying probably that the.

75
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,890
The concepts and definitions in here are going to

76
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,620
be a bit more subtle than what we went through

77
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,080
pretty quickly last week with the economic

78
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,620
ensemble, we've seen most of the basic ideas

79
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,860
before. Building at the canonical example use the

80
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,980
same sort of a trick to analyze the particle

81
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,560
reservoirs within the thermal reservoir, the

82
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,830
sample, and look pretty quickly through the

83
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,100
corresponding free energy and the generalization

84
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,230
first thought to try to keep from blasting through

85
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:42,060
all the material in this unit or at least this

86
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,130
first section quite so quickly so that. All of the

87
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,810
essential subtleties and the reasons we have to be

88
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,330
careful about our definitions of quantum and

89
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,960
classical statistics are hopefully clear and easy

90
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,800
to understand.

91
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,460
And the starting point, having said that, we'll

92
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,640
just be. And considering quantum behavior as

93
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,150
nonsense, it turns out to be realized. We got a

94
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,090
glimpse of at least a piece of this kind of

95
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,090
behavior all the way back when we started thinking

96
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,260
about ideal gases that was in it for the framework

97
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:26,060
of the canonical ensemble. Where we did a bit of

98
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,850
slightly circular argumentation. Noting that the

99
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,550
canonical provision function, so the sum of all

100
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,720
microstates, I love the the factors that depend on

101
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,860
the energy use of that microstates defined by the

102
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,430
set of moments for all the particles normalized by

103
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:52,280
the temperature in order to leave the sum as a

104
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,030
well-defined sum. We need to be able to label or

105
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,540
count these microstates, the sum over them. So we

106
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,430
said this nonsense that these moments are for the

107
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,120
ideal gas must be quantized in a way that depends

108
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,310
on the volume which they said, which produces a

109
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,950
discrete value implementor that have accountable

110
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,480
number of energy levels that ultimately give us a

111
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,740
comfortable number of microstates for the sum

112
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,170
defining the partition function.

113
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:38,430
But given that some of these. Matter for each of

114
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,910
the particles in the systems that define the

115
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,420
competition function. We argue that at least in

116
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,040
the regime where this relation holds, which is

117
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:57,640
that the plank's constant bar introduced as. A

118
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,930
constant relating the volume of the system to the

119
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:07,020
possible dementor of each particle. If that is

120
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,850
much smaller than this product of the linear size

121
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,860
of the system, so is one side of the ball, you

122
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,510
know, just the gas is contained and is the mass of

123
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,870
the particles that we are considering. And he is

124
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:28,680
the temperature. Then. Given the energy use that

125
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,610
depended on.

126
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,570
And the big energies we had for each particle were

127
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,460
proportional to.

128
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,210
This product.

129
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,730
Each bar squared.

130
00:09:51,270 --> 00:10:01,030
Over at. And elsewhere. And whatever. The factor,

131
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,790
the numerator here is very small compared to the

132
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,430
rest of it, any of the energy level is small

133
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,990
enough to have of some factors our space very

134
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,750
close to each other, which is to say that the

135
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,830
function being summed over is very smooth and can

136
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:22,600
be very well approximated by the multidimensional

137
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,120
integral rather than a sum integrated over

138
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,450
continuous parameters rather than the discrete

139
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,820
moments that we have introduced to be the

140
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,480
production function. So. Despite formally

141
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,440
introducing the need to regulate the system by

142
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,100
quantize, it's not until after a few mathematical

143
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:49,670
manipulations we went straight back to. Dealing

144
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,530
with continuously varying momenta. As an

145
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:59,010
approximation to that underlying discreetness. And

146
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,950
then we want to define important statistics, there

147
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,360
will be two things we have to change in this story

148
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,400
compared to what we've gone through earlier. The

149
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,300
first is fairly obvious, given the discussion up

150
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,050
to now. So we will retain the discreet energy

151
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,300
levels rather than approximated by a continuous

152
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:26,340
Ligairi function and. Any calculations that we do

153
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,530
with these discrete energy levels still in place

154
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:35,310
will remain valid, not only when? The system size,

155
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,920
temperature and gas are collectively large

156
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,010
compared to place, but also in the quantum regime

157
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,010
where these two factors are comparable.

158
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:53,080
The second change is the more subtle. Which is

159
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,500
related to the fact that in quantum mechanics, we

160
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,870
are dealing with indistinguishable particles,

161
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:06,040
indistinguishable particles. This is something

162
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,410
that you can get out of the car mechanics module

163
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,880
that is just going to have to be taken as given in

164
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,700
this module. So we will say that we are interested

165
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,060
only in identifying particles that are

166
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,750
fundamentally indistinguishable. And to say that

167
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,360
this is a feature of quantum mechanics. And the.

168
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,300
Issue that arises in this case is how to handle

169
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,280
microstates in which there is more than one of

170
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,510
these indistinguishable particles in a single

171
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:49,760
energy level of the sort that be considered in the

172
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,150
unit for every. Recall when?

173
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,500
Back around back in this Section four point one

174
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,020
where we went through this argument, there was a

175
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,730
footnote noting exactly where this assumption had

176
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,320
come into play that we assumed every particle in

177
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,330
the system had a different momentum, or to say

178
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,820
that the way it was in a different energy level

179
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,930
with a different value of the energy, and you'll

180
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,900
go through these two steps in more detail, one

181
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,790
after the next, and then we'll see how. The.

182
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,180
See what problem is introduced when that

183
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,780
assumption breaks down and we will also see where

184
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,330
that assumption breaks down, which will correspond

185
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:47,350
to the quantum regime. There are usual classical,

186
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,110
non-partisan approach is going to run into trouble.

187
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:56,140
So that's the. Plan for how this the remainder of

188
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,620
today is to go through both of these changes,

189
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,210
Internet first be fairly simple, one of retaining

190
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,000
a discrete energy levels rather than sending over

191
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,970
continuous variables. And the second. Thinking

192
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,180
more carefully about what happens when multiple

193
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,480
indistinguishable particles occupy the same energy

194
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,090
level. So first, we ignore that second issue and.

195
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,570
We will just compute the economical prediction

196
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:34,240
function for a system with some unspecified but

197
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,950
discrete energy levels. And even though these

198
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,190
energy levels are discrete, they're quantize. By

199
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,230
virtue of ignoring that second issue, we will

200
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:51,250
still end up with a classical or quantum. System,

201
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,710
not classic, the classical set of statistics known

202
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,010
as Maxwell Boltzmann statistics, we've already

203
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,080
heard Boltzmann's name many times it was marginal

204
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,830
or connected to theoretical developments in

205
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,660
statistical physics. Nineteen hundreds. James

206
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,950
thought Maxwell was a Scottish physicist working

207
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,170
around that same time. He's best known for

208
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,400
Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, but also

209
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,000
worked out statistical physics as has as his most

210
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,200
famous physicists asked. Two hundred fifty years.

211
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,610
So.

212
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:33,190
With a brief pause to see to make sure that the

213
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,120
plan is clear.

214
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:41,310
There are no questions about the broad overview of

215
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:46,150
the two steps. We'll be going through. Let's start

216
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:51,370
with that first step and derive great economic

217
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,210
competition function for a system with discrete

218
00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:00,370
energy levels, so. To put some vacation in place,

219
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,780
you will see that these discrete energy levels are.

220
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,410
Label by the variable L lowercase no running from

221
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:17,650
zero up to some large capital L. which we can take

222
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,650
to infinity while still leaving the number of

223
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,470
energy levels and hence the number of microstates

224
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:29,900
countable. And during the partition function, well

225
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,970
defined and some over this comfortable microstates,

226
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,100
the energy level itself. We will refer to you with

227
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,160
this calligraphic for a truly e labeled by and.

228
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:51,490
One minor subtlety in this approach is that the

229
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,540
energy level is characterized both by the actual

230
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,970
value of the energy for a single particle, and so

231
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,170
each energy level refers to the possible

232
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:10,390
microstates of a single particle. And in addition

233
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:15,590
to the actual value of the energy with capital E

234
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,670
agreement funds, they will bael, it is also

235
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,760
possible for there to be additional information

236
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,900
distinguishing energy levels so that multiple

237
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,020
distinct energy levels E, Sabeen and Ezabad,

238
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,270
within the different from anything can be

239
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,270
different, indistinguishable even when they have

240
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:42,810
the same energy. So the upper case energy is our

241
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,060
equal. I apologize already for the proliferation

242
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,190
of different sorts of issues that will have to be

243
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:52,010
kept track of in this universe as we build things

244
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,240
up.

245
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:59,980
And the. Technical term of four different energy

246
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,090
levels with the same value of the energy for the

247
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,730
particle is that these energy levels are

248
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:12,220
degenerate and we will choose to label all of the

249
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:18,220
energy levels so that whatever this. Index that

250
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,200
increases the energy itself is now decreasing, so

251
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,910
it either stays the same or increases, and without

252
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,060
loss of generality, we can shift all of the energy

253
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:35,080
levels by any additive constants so that the

254
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,800
smallest energy is Sub-Zero responding to the

255
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,860
crown stage, the lowest energy level, which would

256
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,170
be the calligraphic use of zero,

257
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,340
is non-negative that.

258
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,160
Is justifiable and can be justified if you want to

259
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,970
see that argument. Now, what we have to do with

260
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,750
this notation in place of energy levels and the

261
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,710
cost of energy for these levels is that we have to

262
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:12,970
define the microstates that we sell over. In

263
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,460
writing down the Grand Canal, the coopetition

264
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,640
function, that depends on the temperature that the

265
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,850
potential new. And you drive last week that

266
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,620
the factor being subdued in the great economical

267
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,000
partition functions, this exponential factor that

268
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,510
depends on both the energy and the chemical

269
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,420
potential times the number of particles in the

270
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,660
corresponding micro space because of all of that

271
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,260
divided by temperature, multiplied by the inverse

272
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,070
temperature below.

273
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,630
Now, there's a.

274
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,310
Nice way to organize the some of the microstates

275
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,060
so that we can keep track of all the microstates,

276
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,720
ensure that we don't lose track of it. You can

277
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:13,510
also handle them all. In a easy way, based on the

278
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:17,020
work that we've already done, and this is to break

279
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,280
up the single sum over all possible microstates

280
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:26,800
into a series of cells, each of which considers a

281
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,050
particular value for the particle. No, so. It's

282
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,270
written here. In his first term to break up the

283
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,630
sum over the microstates, I guess the first is

284
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,020
some over the microstates that have new particles

285
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,240
in them, they're actually always turns out to be a

286
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,530
single micro state of that, which is just empty

287
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,860
back, you know, particles. And then we separate

288
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,980
them off from a second sum over all of the

289
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,840
microstates indexed by chain that involve only a

290
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,980
single particle. So this is. Taking into account

291
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,210
the fact that the number of particles in the blood

292
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,210
sample was not fixed and can fluctuate by particle

293
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,660
exchange with the particle reservoir, and we can

294
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,160
tell you the next song by studying over the

295
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,850
microstates that involve exactly two particles.

296
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,050
And in all of the exponential factors that are

297
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:32,860
appearing in the song. We can plug in already that

298
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,120
the protocol number multiply that multiplies the

299
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,280
chemical potential is equal to one to two to three

300
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,980
and so on, up to infinity.

301
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,520
What we can do with this, why this is the oldest

302
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,970
trick, is that if we break up these exponential

303
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:56,690
factors.

304
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:07,120
Into so where a fixed number of particles, lower

305
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,480
case than times do we can pull this constant

306
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,390
factor of new times in?

307
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,570
Outside of the overall sum and what is next, then,

308
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,590
is just the sum over Bowsman factors, even the

309
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:31,240
minus beta times energy. For all of the

310
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,370
microstates that have either a fixed number of

311
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,760
articles being one, a fixed number of articles

312
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,420
being two and so on, up to having a fixed number

313
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,620
of particles being infinite and fixing the number

314
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,400
of particles while allowing the energies to

315
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,100
fluctuate with the fixed temperature exactly

316
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,820
defines the canonical partition function for and

317
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,340
particles as a function of the inverse temperature.

318
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,450
So. After we pull out the exponential factor that

319
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,780
depends on the times, the chemical potential.

320
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,760
Times the critical number for all the microstates

321
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,470
with that fixed number of particles.

322
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,540
Chemical factories multiplies the economic

323
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,510
competition function for the corresponding number

324
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,470
of particles, starting with the trivial zero

325
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,590
particle, because is unity and the protection

326
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,780
function for a single particle, you cannot have a

327
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,330
production function for two particles and then

328
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,290
generally some.

329
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,530
Over the number of particles ranging from zero to

330
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:48,710
infinity of. This exponential factor into The View

331
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,310
is raised to the power of the number of particles

332
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,240
that multiplies the canonical partition function

333
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,210
for that fixed number of particles in each other.

334
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,570
And this is a general result, but we haven't had

335
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,410
to specify any details of the energy levels

336
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,090
themselves.

337
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,510
This holds for any grain economical system with

338
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,940
discrete energy levels, it is known as the free

339
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,260
gas, the expansion a I'll tell you right now,

340
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,810
that's not a term you'll have to remember

341
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,030
something you might see popping up here. There it

342
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,050
is present because this exponential factor that I

343
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,380
put out is called the figure acidy for obscure

344
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,550
historical reasons.

345
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,760
We will benefit from this approach is that now, in

346
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,420
order to compute the great economic competition

347
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,500
function with oil that's calculated down to

348
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,070
dealing with economical partition functions, which

349
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,440
of course, we did for several weeks in the

350
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,180
framework of Abdelbasset cycles, and in particular

351
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:07,630
we saw that in units three and four that we have

352
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:12,030
in indistinguishable particles in an ideal system

353
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,200
with these particles don't interact with each

354
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:21,920
other. That the end particle hold function is.

355
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,150
Just the single particle protection function

356
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:30,980
raised to the power of end and then normalized by

357
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,770
this factor of one over and factorial that

358
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,950
corrects for the overcounting.

359
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,310
Repeatedly counting different microstates that

360
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,470
would differ only by the labels we give the

361
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,230
different particles. And while I talk, I'll try to

362
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,900
come down with the later on that screen.

363
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,220
So.

364
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:09,020
Particles get that full factor of the function to

365
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,360
the power. And that counts all the different ways

366
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,060
we can imagine the different particles of

367
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,650
microstates from the particles are

368
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,960
indistinguishable, all of those different

369
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,410
labelling secretly describe the same microstates

370
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,510
in that factory and factorial as to be divided out

371
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:35,530
to get the correct number of micro microstates. So

372
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:42,240
that is. The Carex for the overcounting. Of this

373
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,820
invisible particles from the base, the particle

374
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,150
position function off of the powers of the single

375
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:53,140
particle protection function. But this is. A very

376
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,530
nice expression to insert into the equation and to

377
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:02,710
keep that guessing factor to our end and then in

378
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,670
the important competition function as whatever in

379
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,550
factorial times, the single part, partition

380
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:13,600
function to the power, and we can rearrange things

381
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:18,370
as the cell membrane from zero to infinity of one

382
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,340
over and factorial times, some quantity to the

383
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,180
power end, which is exactly the power series for

384
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,740
the exponential function.

385
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:37,580
So this whole infinite sum over infinite options

386
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,980
for the number of particles in the Grand Canal

387
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:46,280
system boils down to just the exponential of the

388
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,720
single particle canonical efficient function times

389
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,930
the sagacity exponential factor of chemical

390
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,070
potential divided by temperature.

391
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,360
We.

392
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,070
The fact that we're considering a system with the

393
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:09,030
discreet energy levels that we define at the start

394
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:13,670
of this subsection, so. There are these

395
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,070
microstates labeled by Hill that each have

396
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,560
possibly equal energies separately, so then the

397
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:27,510
single particle microstates are simply. Counting

398
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,600
how many energy levels there are for this single

399
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,790
particle to occupy. And with each energy level,

400
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,030
the corresponding both the vector. And the

401
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:43,100
canonical approach is E to the negative by times,

402
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,680
times, that energy, so the overall single particle

403
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,030
petition function simply has to sum over all of

404
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,750
those energy levels of that Boltzmann factor into

405
00:28:54,750 --> 00:29:00,390
the minus beta, the energy. So every so there are

406
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,410
L plus one total microstates, they went from zero

407
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:08,100
up to L, each of them correspond to a different

408
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:13,050
energy level, even when the value of the energy

409
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,320
for the energy level may be the same. And if we

410
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,350
plug in this expression for the single particle

411
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,160
protection function into the grand canonical

412
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,730
partition function that we derived through the

413
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,700
capacity expansion, then we have.

414
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,820
The exponential of that figure has to be times the

415
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,030
sum of the factors which we can rearrange before

416
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,090
we get into orbit, if we get ourselves into an

417
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:45,690
exponential that looks more like what we're used

418
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:50,010
to for the grand canonical. Ensemble. So the

419
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:53,100
exponential of the sum overall energy levels of

420
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,720
this exponential factor, it the minus B times the

421
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:04,200
difference. Between the energy of each energy

422
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,950
level, labor, well, minus the fixed chemical

423
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,090
potential of the system.

424
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:16,640
So that is. The chemical protection function that

425
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,420
defines this Maxell both statistics, so it's the

426
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,150
grand canonical statistics for.

427
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,820
Classical systems with discrete quantize energy

428
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,080
levels and before going on into the second issue,

429
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,990
that distinguishes true quantum statistics from

430
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:41,260
this classical result. Was paused to make sure

431
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,680
that.

432
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,260
This. This derivation didn't.

433
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,930
Raising questions in your mind as we went through

434
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,820
his last few minutes.

435
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:13,770
I guess I've already. Give it away, the next step

436
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,580
in the presentation here, which is on the screen,

437
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,730
which is that. The argument about distinguishable

438
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,850
versus indistinguishable particles that I went

439
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,660
through, I tried to block out the sun and get the

440
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:36,570
screen a bit more visible is only correct. When?

441
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,400
Each of the particles in the system is in a

442
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,340
different energy level, so when we brought in this

443
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,880
factor of whatever and factorial that we said was

444
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:52,260
present to correct for overcounting of building

445
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,830
and particle partition function out of a product

446
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,960
of any single particle prediction functions. We

447
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:05,250
implicitly assume. That's. Each of the different

448
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,070
particles that we want to multiply together can be

449
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,860
labeled in a different way, which is only possible

450
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:17,180
when they are in a. Different energy level. In the

451
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:21,140
context of Section four point one, I think it was

452
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,840
this equation fifty one, we were assuming that

453
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,600
every particle in the ideal gas was considered at

454
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,070
that time had a distinct momentum. And we went

455
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,740
through this argument by looking at the different

456
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,470
ways those different Amanto could be labeled,

457
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,040
setting aside until now the question of what

458
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,130
happens when we would have identical particles

459
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,780
with identical momentum.

460
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,550
We set that aside in Unit four because we were

461
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,570
working in a regime, but we argue that the

462
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,670
energies were effectively dirty and continuous.

463
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,960
Thanks to that relation that we had close to being

464
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:09,160
much smaller than the combination of system

465
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,850
parameters governing the energies. And if we

466
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,600
imagine having a real value of energy energies

467
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:19,580
that there is a vanishing chance of picking to

468
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,420
real numbers completely at random and having them

469
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,870
exactly matched to infinitely many decimal places

470
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:33,700
and. This holds more generally if and only if

471
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,620
there are many more accessible energy levels, then

472
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:44,690
there are particles to occupy. And the regime

473
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:49,460
where the assumption of every particle in a

474
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,390
different energy level breaks down is precisely

475
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,970
the one we are now interested in. So let's.

476
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:02,950
Go through a much simpler illustration of exactly

477
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:06,640
how this can cause problems, I've told you that.

478
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,760
This is a problem of the overcounting factor,

479
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:15,640
depends on particles being in different energy

480
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,730
levels. Let's think about the simplest possible

481
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:23,740
system where this problem arises to see that it is

482
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,640
a problem and get an idea for what we can do about

483
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:34,510
it. So. We will consider a system with a fixed

484
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,450
number of particles and see your end equals two

485
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:43,480
particles, and we'll say it has five. Energy

486
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:49,540
levels, so. Calligraphic e Sub-Zero through a

487
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,630
script E for and just to make things as simple as

488
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,120
possible, you'll make all five of those energy

489
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,350
levels to generate and shift the energy so that

490
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:04,400
every one of these five energy levels as a

491
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,090
vanishing energy. For L from zero to four

492
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:13,090
inclusive, so the single particle. You know, equal

493
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,050
protection function.

494
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:21,990
Is simply counting. A factor of one with energy is

495
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:27,630
zero for every microstates. Independent of

496
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,870
whatever the temperature is, so long as that

497
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,620
temperature is finite and not zero, so that we

498
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:38,490
don't get into issues of dividing 050 no, take

499
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:43,760
that as given say that the opposition function. As

500
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,580
a consequence, must be a positive integer, it is

501
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,610
counting how many microstates there are in the

502
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:54,860
system. So the single single particle case, we

503
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:59,300
have five energy levels that that particle could

504
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,680
be in over those five energy levels gives us the

505
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,230
five microstates that we know we have.

506
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,220
And this actually turns out to be the same

507
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:18,780
calculation as a simple combinatorial problem by

508
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,370
counting the number of ways that. This certain

509
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:27,750
number of particles or bottles. So if we have any

510
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:32,640
close to particles, we want to place them in the

511
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,670
five different energy levels, we can represent

512
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,340
those energy levels as boxes that can hold these

513
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:43,350
bottles and represent all the possible microstates

514
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:47,130
just by drawing five boxes with a total of two

515
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,000
bottles distributed between them, either two

516
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,370
bottles in the same box or one bottle in each of

517
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,180
two different boxes. And hopefully I have

518
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,630
presented the setup clearly enough that you can

519
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:07,410
tell me the two particle partition function if the

520
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,080
balls are distinguishable in this case.

521
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:31,590
And so we want to compute the two party

522
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:36,270
coopetition function, assuming that the particles

523
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,330
are distinguishable when the two of them can

524
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:43,020
occupy any of five distinct energy levels.

525
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,580
Yes.

526
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:54,970
Which is in the case of plugging in L and twenty

527
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:59,410
five total number of microstates corresponding to

528
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,060
the five ways that the first ball can be placed in

529
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,060
any of the five energy levels for each of the five

530
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,820
ways that the second bullet can be placed in them.

531
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,370
So this is the usual relation that we had for

532
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:19,300
distinguishable particles. In the canonical

533
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:25,150
example, the end particle partition function is

534
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,520
the power of the single particle partition

535
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,770
function, and that same argument for

536
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,820
indistinguishable particles then corrects for the

537
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:39,460
overcounting of those two, those two particles. So

538
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,460
taking them from distinguishable to

539
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,210
indistinguishable. We bring in this factor of

540
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:51,560
whatever and Vectorial, which is one half, and we

541
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,690
find out that the two political parties can

542
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:00,110
function in this article. This is 12 and a half,

543
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,890
which supposedly is counting the number of

544
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:07,370
microstates in the system, which is nonsense

545
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,620
because there's no such thing as half a

546
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,760
microstates. So you've got bomb somewhere in this

547
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,760
process. And the reason we cut things down to such

548
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,270
a small example is to be able to look at things in

549
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,590
full detail and see exactly where it went wrong

550
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,870
and then what we can do about it. So. You've

551
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,030
already said that it is the overcounting

552
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:39,550
correction that goes wrong. And gives us this

553
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,540
nonsensical, not integer number of microstates.

554
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,860
And if we start off in the distinction of the case

555
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:53,260
that we considered first, we can do that by

556
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,560
supposing that one of these balls is red, that the

557
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,380
other is blue, we can label each micro state by a

558
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:08,160
five digit code summarizing how many particles in

559
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,180
the distinguishable case. We have to specify which

560
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,210
particular particle is in each of the five energy

561
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,780
levels. So if any of these energy levels has no

562
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,950
particles, we can label it with zero. If it has

563
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,040
the red particle in, it could be labeled with the

564
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:28,160
power. If it has the blue particle in taking label

565
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,150
with a B. and if those particles are in the

566
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,630
particular energy level, we can label that with a

567
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:41,800
two and this list here of five times five

568
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:48,310
different ways of. Putting these two balls in the

569
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:52,480
five boxes is that full set of twenty five

570
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,510
microstates. That we had the previous page, there

571
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,200
are 20 where the red and blue balls are in

572
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,460
different boxes and five in this last column where

573
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,320
both of them are in every single one of these

574
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,170
individuals.

575
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,500
So that. Is accounting for all twenty five

576
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,790
microstates. And we tried to get to the

577
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,400
microstates indistinguishable particles on the

578
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:31,640
previous page by. Dividing by two, claiming that

579
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,000
this accounted for the overcounting that we can

580
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,030
actually see in this list every. Microstates in

581
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:47,790
the first home. Is. Almost the same as every

582
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:51,420
microstates in the third column, if we just

583
00:41:51,420 --> 00:42:00,120
interchange the blue ball, the red ball. So all 20

584
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,010
of those microstates in the case of

585
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:05,370
indistinguishably particles are indeed double

586
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:11,250
counted by exactly the factor of two and factorial

587
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,230
that we are used to. But that is not the case for

588
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:21,820
the final column where. The red, blue and gold are

589
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:27,470
both in the same energy level. Each of these micro

590
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:31,640
states is not being double counted, even when the

591
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,060
particles are distinguishable in the micro state

592
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:39,550
remains the same. And in particular, is not

593
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:44,410
corrected for double counting. When we go from the

594
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:48,130
about particles to the indistinguishable particles

595
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:54,310
of quantum mechanics, so rather than that total

596
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:57,730
twenty five divided by Victoria microstates, we

597
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:03,010
really end up with 15 because it was only the set

598
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,730
of microstates where the particles were a

599
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:10,090
different energy levels that were double counted

600
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,970
in the classical approach and had to have that

601
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:16,990
double counting correctly. And having gone through

602
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,350
the sort of exhaustive exercise of seeing what

603
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:24,100
goes wrong in the classical approach when it's

604
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,070
possible for multiple particles to be in the same

605
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:34,330
energy level we can. Appreciates the simple way to

606
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,840
fix this, which is instead of something over.

607
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:44,240
Single particles and then multiply all a single

608
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,450
particle partition functions together to get the

609
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,980
end particle partition function and correcting for

610
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,720
overcounting after the fact, we can turn the

611
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,020
approach on its head and represent the system in

612
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:02,480
terms of the occupation numbers for each energy

613
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,750
level. Occupation number is something that we saw

614
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:12,710
before when going through the replica trick to

615
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:16,820
define both economical and economical ensemble

616
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,370
with an ensemble, their large external reservoirs

617
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:26,250
here. This occupation number and SIBYLLE. Is

618
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:30,570
counting the number of particles in the

619
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:34,010
corresponding energy level labeled by that same

620
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:38,240
metal. And this gives us the definition of quantum

621
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,520
statistics where. The protection function that we

622
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,460
always start off with remains a symbol over all

623
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,470
the microstates, but we define those microstates.

624
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,850
By considering in turn each energy level and then

625
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:01,330
something over all of the possible occupation

626
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:08,670
numbers. That this energy level could have. So

627
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,390
this is.

628
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,900
There are two things to say about this. First of

629
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,510
all, it differs from the classical approach that

630
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,940
we've been doing up till now. But what we did for

631
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,030
Maxwell, both statistics with discrete energy

632
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:29,940
levels where we summed over all of the what we

633
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,340
consider and in turn, each particle.

634
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:38,000
And stumbled over the possible energies that it

635
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:46,050
could have. And in addition to. Giving us a just a

636
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,360
different way of organizing the calculation. It

637
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,510
turns out to be the better way of organizing the

638
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:55,380
calculation, we have to worry about multiple

639
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:01,530
occupancy of particular energy levels because.

640
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:11,380
In the quantum approach, if we take the tactic of

641
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:14,260
something over the energy levels, something over

642
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:17,950
the possible occupation, we can see it may be

643
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,150
worth going through that simple exercise in that

644
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:25,270
way. In doing so, I don't think we have time to do

645
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:30,520
that in the few minutes remaining today, but it

646
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:36,330
will indeed turn out that. There is no further

647
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:39,810
need to correct for any overcounting because we

648
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,620
organize things in terms first of energy levels

649
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:45,480
and then.

650
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:51,340
On the screen first in terms of energy levels and

651
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,300
then in terms of occupation numbers, all the

652
00:46:54,300 --> 00:47:00,330
microstates are accounted for one by one with No.

653
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,890
Overcounting, now that we get from the classical

654
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:09,180
approach and then have to try to correct it, is

655
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,430
exactly that overcounting that becomes.

656
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:16,460
Problematic, or at least not trivial, whenever

657
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,610
there can be multiple articles in the same energy

658
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:24,120
level. Now. In principle, we could continue to.

659
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,630
Follow that classical approach and try to keep

660
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:36,030
track of. How many microstates have this issue of

661
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,390
multiple particles in the same energy level that

662
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:43,410
would have to be handled specially and not just

663
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:48,470
divided by one of reinfect real? Normalization

664
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:52,310
factor. In practice, that turns out to be

665
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,680
equivalent to the quantum approach of something

666
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,730
over energy levels and occupation numbers. So that

667
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:01,880
is. The.

668
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,540
The definition of quantum statistics and the way

669
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:11,050
that it varies from vasculitis effects in addition

670
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:16,240
to maintaining discrete energy levels. We also

671
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,260
have to keep track of the occupation numbers of

672
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:23,710
those energy levels and approach the population in

673
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:27,340
such a way that overcounting does not become an

674
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:31,540
issue even when there can be multiple particles in

675
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:36,520
the same energy level. And that is a good place to

676
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,930
stop for today. If there are immediate questions,

677
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:45,070
bring that up now. Otherwise, went back to my

678
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:49,270
office for office hours and we'll pick up tomorrow

679
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:54,110
morning by considering. The possible occupation

680
00:48:54,110 --> 00:49:01,190
numbers, that's just part of the occupation

681
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:06,750
numbers that are possible for energy levels. Two

682
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:10,510
different cases, but it also sounds like you think

683
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:13,530
the types of particles that lead to two distinct

684
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:19,300
types of quantum systems. So that's a great

685
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,350
question. I will see you then tomorrow morning to

686
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:23,580
pick up with that.

687
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,940
So for.
