1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,160
All right, that's the recording started.  According

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,330
to my watch, those bells were ringing just a

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,690
little bit early. We might as well get going with

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:22,760
the six-digit number for today, which she is four zero zero zero one nine.

5
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,930
I'll keep that up there and see if there are any

6
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,220
questions about what we went through last week

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,910
with the introduction of ideal gases and their

8
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,120
application in thermodynamic cycles.

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,470
Today is the seventh

10
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,750
of March and it's feeling a bit more like spring. We'll see if it

11
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,730
sticks around.  Tlace where we are in

12
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,230
this module is today, we're going to wrap up our

13
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,590
discussion of thermodynamic cycles,

14
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,180
which

15
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,610
in turn is built on the behaviour of ideal gases in some

16
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,960
containers, which in turn is built on the

17
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:38,030
framework of the. Ensemble systems with fixed

18
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,820
temperature and fixed particle number, but

19
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,710
variable internal energy use zoom out.

20
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,860
Refocussed.

21
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:51,640
So.

22
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,470
Last week, we. Collected the four key equations

23
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,720
board for the Olympic cycles, and in part because

24
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,490
the projector is looking a bit uninspiring,

25
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,600
Brittanys equations down on the board for some

26
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,840
further reference to that solution between the

27
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,830
internal energy and temperature of the gases and

28
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,890
particles, whether the particles distinguishable

29
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,050
or not. We saw that in both cases of

30
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,450
distinguishable, indistinguishable particles, the

31
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,820
entropy is distinguishable part of the time.

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Temperature of the three has power so that if that

33
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,770
product were constant, that guaranteed as an

34
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,700
entropy and isotropic or enigmatic process drive

35
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:54,510
the ideal gas law pressure times. The volume gets

36
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,560
to the number of particles and the temperature,

37
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,020
and finally generalize to the first of all of

38
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,920
thermodynamics to recognize two different ways

39
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,760
that the internal energy of our system can change,

40
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,000
both by exchanging heat with its entitlements or

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,130
through the process of work. The application of

42
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,150
force that changes the volume at the ideal gas

43
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,910
gases in this sheet is related to a change in the

44
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,090
entropy multiplied by the temperature. Work is

45
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,840
negative of the pressure changes due to the force

46
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,800
exerted on the system.

47
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,190
We also saw that these equations together allow

48
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,450
the full macroscopic or thermodynamics status of

49
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,450
the system to be specified by any two of these

50
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,900
qualities. So we focused on the pressure and

51
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,060
volume, introducing the so-called PV diagrams as

52
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,950
visual representations of the work scale from the

53
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,520
state of the systems under consideration. As well

54
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,470
as particular, the cycles which formed close loops

55
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,410
on these Peevey diagrams, cycling back, back

56
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,290
around to their starting point as a sequence of

57
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,740
processes are carried out and as an example.

58
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,850
The theme of the cycle we looked at. Cycle that is

59
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:41,710
called the current cycle. So. The key feature here

60
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,810
is that the thermodynamic system is allowed to

61
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,360
exchange energy with both a hot reservoir and in

62
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,560
the cold reservoir.

63
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,270
And the four is.

64
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,330
That build up this cycle.

65
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,730
Are two stages of isothermal expansion and

66
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,660
contraction, interspersed with two stages of

67
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,150
idiomatic expansion is the practice of drawing c.B

68
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,650
diagrams or DeCaro Cycles. You start from some

69
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,400
point, they do a slow isothermal extensions, which

70
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,590
will be what keeps the temperature constant by

71
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,720
proceeding slowly enough of all possible heat

72
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,350
exchange with the surroundings can occur, then do

73
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,500
a thermal expansion. Sorry about that, that

74
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,010
extension and try to see

75
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,080
exactly high temperature of the reservoir see down

76
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,440
here as the temperature of the Cold War

77
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,020
and then repeat the process with the slow pace of

78
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,940
thermal compression that somebody followed by the

79
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,130
final stage of a famous event of compression. Back

80
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,350
to the starting point. They do it quickly enough

81
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,100
that no heat at all can be exchanged. And the

82
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,920
interviews at either end of. The processes are the

83
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,420
same.

84
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,370
The final topic that we started on on Friday and

85
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,960
we'll wrap up today is looking at the efficiency

86
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,700
of a 30 day cycle. Which is defined as the amount

87
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,750
of work that the cycle can do on its surroundings,

88
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,620
getting useful,

89
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,140
useful work out of the flow of heat through the

90
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,840
cycle. And that has to be normalized by the total

91
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,710
amount of heat flowing into the cycle. And we saw

92
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:11,530
from the first law of thermodynamics. That while

93
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:17,120
the efficiency is. Strictly positive, it can be no

94
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,050
larger than one, which is. We can't be phrased. By

95
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,870
saying that the first law of thermodynamics

96
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,400
guarantees that. We can't win with any engine, we

97
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,750
can't get out more work than the amount of heat

98
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,280
that we have to pour into it in order to make it

99
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,480
work. And this is, to put it another way, why the

100
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,650
perpetual motion machines don't exist, theoretical

101
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,610
objects that can produce more work than compared

102
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,590
to the energy that is needed to operate and

103
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:58,560
operate. So getting back to the place in the notes

104
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,130
where we left off yesterday, we should keep this

105
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,310
on the screen and see if there are any follow up

106
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,370
questions about these topics that you caught up to

107
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,630
where we were.

108
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:24,130
This is connecting now to. The efficiency. Is

109
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,850
defined in terms of the output work done by the

110
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,670
system on its surroundings, minus the input work

111
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,060
done by the surroundings on the system.

112
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,060
Related to the heat flowing in and out of the

113
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,270
system by that first law enforcement, an annex

114
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,160
giving us the efficiency between zero and one that

115
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,920
we just reviewed. So picking up here, let's go

116
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,910
through the exercise of calculating the efficiency

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,450
for the current cycle and make sure all of these

118
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:04,070
concepts hang together in that calculation. So.

119
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,000
All we need to do is figure out how much work is

120
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,030
being done, both by the system on its surroundings

121
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,790
and by the surroundings of the system and how much

122
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,360
heat is flowing into and out of the system as it

123
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,250
goes around each of these four stages in its

124
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,730
degree, separate from those equations. So it

125
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,800
started off at point A, you want to figure out

126
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,100
what is. Going on in terms of heat and work with

127
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,310
the likes of thermal expansion from point A to

128
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,970
point B.

129
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:48,980
Now.

130
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,030
I guess through this calculation, you might call

131
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,910
back to some of the results we computed last week

132
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,380
in terms of the temperatures that we saw, was the

133
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:08,030
specific volume that the system has to deal in

134
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,700
order to close the cycle and get back around and

135
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,400
start reporting, as well as the volumes of the

136
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,750
pressure at each of these four points. And for the

137
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,060
work going back to the original definition that we

138
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,900
started off this year with, we have. But we're

139
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,840
given by the negative integral from point A to

140
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,170
point B of the pressure is a function of volume

141
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:38,430
that is coming exactly from the ideal gas law is

142
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,230
in times of temperature over Viðga to be that

143
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,280
temperature is fixed at T h

144
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,900
the high temperature of the reservoir. It's a

145
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,480
constant that can come out of. It's integral, and

146
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,380
then you're just left with D.V. divided by V, that

147
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,650
integral is known to its friends as the logarithm.

148
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,590
So.

149
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:13,660
Plugging in the units from going from point A to

150
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,470
point B, you pick up this ratio.

151
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,040
So there's volumes and these are two of the

152
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,640
qualities that we know we can't control as we sell

153
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,990
the car, so we have a choice of how much we are

154
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,030
expanding. So before taking in the fast economic

155
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:41,970
expansion from B to C, so the only thing we don't

156
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,340
really have control over in this expression is

157
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,360
that number of particles in. But we can do is use

158
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,940
the idea of gas again to replace that ency with

159
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:02,870
PVG for. Either A or B, I choose Point A.. That's

160
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,970
our starting point with the input that we had in

161
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,320
September on the. The collection of variables that

162
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,860
we are able to start off with under our control,

163
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,680
and I might as well also get rid of that negative

164
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,780
sign just by inverting the arguments of the

165
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,240
logarithm, looking at the ratio of Vuh over

166
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,260
Overbey, rather than able to figure. We can see

167
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:38,290
here that since VLA is smaller than ever before

168
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,140
and after this expansion, the argument of the log

169
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,740
is less than one block as a whole is then less

170
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,580
than zero point. The pressure always have to be

171
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:54,200
positive for. The physical systems of interest, so

172
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,740
what we find is a particular expression for the

173
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,890
work done going from point A to B, that is less

174
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,210
than zero. If we go back to our definitions of the

175
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:10,520
word means that the internal energy of the gas

176
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:14,330
provided to the system in the cycle is decreasing.

177
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,020
Energy has been removed from the system to perform

178
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,930
work on the surroundings of the system, turning

179
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,310
the gears, making the wheels go forward.

180
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,470
So in this first stage of expansion, we have work

181
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,160
being done by the system on its surroundings and.

182
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,360
Because it is isothermal also, he is being

183
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,410
exchanged to keep that temperature constant, we

184
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,420
can use the relation between energy and

185
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:55,920
temperature. To see that the change in the total

186
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,410
internal energy. Is just proportional to the

187
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,930
change in the temperature, which is zero because

188
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,650
the temperature is fixed. So this huge heat plus

189
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,340
the work of the stage has to add up to zero. So

190
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,900
the amount of heat. Flowing into the system. Is

191
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,200
equal to the amount of work being done by the

192
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,830
system, so energy is leaving the system in the

193
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,440
form of work, coming in the form of heat, and

194
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,400
everything is balancing out as we would expect. So

195
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,960
was that first stage of this calculation clear?

196
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,950
I see nods, we can go a bit more quickly through

197
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:44,420
the remaining three stages, the second stages of

198
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,750
adding expansion rather than isothermal expansion.

199
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,250
So the building is still increasing, but it's

200
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,080
doing so much more quickly so that no heat is

201
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,080
exchanged. So we already have. The result of the

202
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,310
heat flow. The second stage, four feet above sea,

203
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:11,600
vanishes, and that allows us to. Figure out the

204
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,730
work without going through the formal integration

205
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,330
over the change, the volume of the pressure on the

206
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:27,470
volume so we can just keep equal to zero. The work

207
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,430
is the total change in energy at Washington.

208
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,430
Energy is 3000 times the total change in

209
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,060
temperature.

210
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:42,140
So. Catch up with what I was saying that.

211
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,020
We're done in the second stage is three 1/2 times

212
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:55,600
the final temperature. To lower the temperature,

213
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:02,890
higher the horrors of war. And if I pull out

214
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,700
overall factor of that. High-temperature.

215
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:16,140
From the criticism. You can recognize that in

216
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,520
times jihad is the same quality we replace with

217
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,840
times with the ideal gas law. Earlier on this page

218
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:30,470
and we. Deputed last time around that. This ratio

219
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:36,260
of the low to high temperatures is related to the

220
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:41,960
ratios of the bones, VBAC specifically to low

221
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,620
poverty, high is.

222
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,810
Smaller volume to be avoided when you see to be

223
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:57,430
two thirds power, and that suffices to put

224
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,940
everything in terms of the quantities we can

225
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:06,170
control. You end up with three haves. Pressure

226
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:11,790
eight times volume at a times that ratio. The

227
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,060
volume is two thirds minus one, and since this

228
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,380
ratio is less than one versus the smaller volume

229
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,010
compared to BC after the expansion, once we

230
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:30,650
subtract one. You can get a negative number. So in

231
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,310
this expansion stage as well, the system continues

232
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:38,000
doing work on its surroundings. So work is being

233
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,110
done by the systems to do useful work. Have a

234
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:48,270
useful effect on the. The surroundings, the rest

235
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,070
of the universe.

236
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,550
Several. The cycle is mostly symmetric, and after

237
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,000
these processes of isothermal expansion and

238
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,940
antibiotic expansion, we put them in reverse at

239
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,450
that lower, mature acetyl depression at the low

240
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,270
temperatures here, followed by adiabatic

241
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:15,010
compression. So we can go through the same

242
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,800
calculation just with. The girls and territory

243
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:27,300
from boy be sexy to the city and the of thermal

244
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,350
compression station.

245
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,890
More.

246
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,890
The ideal gas law relates that pressure now to the

247
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,170
low temperature to times and the same antigrowth

248
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:49,970
over Dve Overbey. So that is the. To go the

249
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,420
integration of TV over because the water isn't in

250
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,100
Florida. Go ahead and absorb that negative sign by.

251
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,890
Inverting the ratio of volumes that appear in the

252
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,560
logarithm.

253
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,380
And.

254
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,820
There are. Two things we can do here. One has to

255
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,340
again.

256
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,670
Pullout, a factor of the height of the surplus,

257
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,820
multiplying and dividing by the high temperature

258
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,200
to put us back to the intensity and is equal to

259
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,280
the year, then we want to.

260
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:38,750
The place this dependence on the boy involved with

261
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,760
the input parameters that we work with, I found an

262
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,010
expression for this final volume in terms of the

263
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,260
other three volumes of the system. There was this

264
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,160
one particular value that it had to take in order

265
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,040
for the cycle to close and get back to the

266
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,610
starting point. Michael Origin here.

267
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:09,340
The ratios of boys, you see over 18 had to be

268
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:15,910
equal to that ratio of Vuh over BP, so no amount

269
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:20,510
of compression or temperature has to match up to

270
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,140
the relative amount of expansion at the high

271
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,700
temperature. So putting all that together.

272
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,080
With, again, any relation between your

273
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,830
temperatures and

274
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:44,410
seem to the two thirds of our times that log of

275
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,030
Vehbi.

276
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:53,790
At this time now the argument on the border is

277
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,640
greater than one plan because much of the volume

278
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,830
of water within itself is positive. And instead of

279
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,790
having the system do work on its surroundings, we

280
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:10,320
find that in order to carry out this compression,

281
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,820
the surroundings have to be doing good on the

282
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,360
system.

283
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:22,340
Increasing the internal energy and essentially

284
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,750
adding to the cost of running the cycle, so we're

285
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,880
no longer getting used to walk out of it. We have

286
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,410
to put more energy into the system. As with the

287
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,920
other isothermal process, the heat and the work

288
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,180
have to balance out. In order to keep the

289
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,710
temperature hostage, you do not consider as well

290
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,010
so that as we could have seen from inspection and

291
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,380
thinking about the physical picture of the cycle,

292
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,260
he has been slow.

293
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,670
Out of the system, into the core reservoir, in

294
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,460
order to keep the temperature constant as the work

295
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,800
is done to compress it. And then finally from.

296
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,210
Last stage about depression from 20 back to the

297
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:22,380
starting point. We can. Repeat essentially this.

298
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,790
Second calculation of the enigmatic expansion with

299
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,590
the only difference is that the change in

300
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,400
temperature is now T minus T, that is there's an

301
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,260
overall negative sign and we have, again, positive

302
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,530
work being done. Equal and opposite to the work

303
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,230
that the system did in its adiabatic expansion

304
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,530
zone, and yes, of course, because this depression

305
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:56,240
is adiabatic from due to a. There is no heat

306
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,430
exchanged, as always, for any the process, so that

307
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,870
is sort of eight pieces of information that we

308
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,950
need to compute the the efficiency, heat and

309
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:15,730
workflow at each of the four stages of this cycle.

310
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:22,010
So if we collect these results, we identify the

311
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:27,230
two stages where work was done by the system on

312
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:33,360
its surroundings. Well, maybe you find this. When

313
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,150
set out to be the positive, absolute magnitude of

314
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,670
the work that the system puts out into the

315
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,670
university to do useful things like training

316
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,460
wheels. This is the negative of the.

317
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,330
Two pieces of work that we completed in the first

318
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,560
two stages, finding them to be less than zero. So

319
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:59,480
this negative signs are. Accounting for.

320
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,770
The definition of work in terms of changing volume

321
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:12,900
and keeping the current amount of output work the

322
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,720
absolute magnitude. Similarly, the work is. The

323
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,980
work done to compress the system with the positive

324
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,090
sign, again, keeping this quality positive and we

325
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,150
found the relation for the last stage that the.

326
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,040
Work done for you. That impression was the

327
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,290
negative of the work done for emetic expansion.

328
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:43,380
And in terms of the heat flow to the cycles have

329
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:47,570
no heat flows by, you'll be able probably to see

330
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:52,160
and then needed a. And we saw that he only flows

331
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,240
into the system during the reception to be it was

332
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:59,570
out of the system during the isothermal oppression

333
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,190
from supervision. That means that since you're

334
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,600
interested only in the keep flowing in to the

335
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:15,140
system, we only have one piece of data to worry

336
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,380
about. Keep flowing in during the isothermal

337
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:23,120
expansion from A to B.. So now we can put all of

338
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,850
this together in our definition for the efficiency

339
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:31,740
of the networks to the put out by the system on

340
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:36,200
the rest of the universe. So negative the word

341
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,110
from A B minus the four on the stage B, C, and

342
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,410
then subtracting the work that has to be put into

343
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,600
the system by its surroundings in order for this

344
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,280
cycle to operate. So subtracting off B, C, C, D at

345
00:25:54,340 --> 00:26:00,440
NBC, which cancels out the. Initial stage from the.

346
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,370
Similar to the work done by two independent

347
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,880
processes are canceling out and the inflow of heat

348
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:15,160
is just this negative of the work done by the

349
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,970
system on surroundings during slow expansion,

350
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,820
cancelling that out, we just find that the ratio

351
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:26,700
is. One plus, the efficiency is much less this

352
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,240
ratio of the work done

353
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,570
in the with depression from CTD divided by the

354
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,080
work done by the isothermal expansion from to.

355
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,920
And what is more, if we actually. Go back up here

356
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:53,960
and look at these values for that work done in the

357
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,580
the stage. It's this complicated expression. How

358
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:03,220
does the boy ratio's times that log over the.

359
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,670
Dorothy.

360
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,130
The expansion phase, the rehab that we want to

361
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:17,780
divide that by has that same factor. It has to log

362
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,310
with the opposite ratio, the smaller going into

363
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,130
the numerator, the larger point that the

364
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:28,440
denominator. So in this ratio, you pick up a

365
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,370
negative sign from flipping the arguments to the

366
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,350
law. And all that is left is then that ratio. The

367
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,940
third is on the screen.

368
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,780
That ratio of and factors which entered being

369
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,050
related to the ratio of the temperatures, so

370
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,540
plugging in the expressions reputedly find the

371
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:57,520
efficiency for the heart of cycle of one minus

372
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:01,810
that ratio of the low temperature to the high

373
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,400
temperature.

374
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:09,060
And just to check that this result we found

375
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:13,320
actually makes sense. We have by definition of the

376
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,350
cold reservoir, but the temperature is smaller and

377
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,040
the high temperature of the reservoir, which means

378
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,470
that this ratio is always going to be less than

379
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,660
one in the efficiency, is always going to be

380
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,750
greater than zero. We do indeed have an engine as

381
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:32,210
required. And you can also see that.

382
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,320
In the limit, where the temperatures of the two

383
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,040
reservoirs approach each other and this ratio of

384
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,680
temperatures goes to one, the efficiency itself

385
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,640
collapses C0, which makes intuitive sense. There's

386
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,310
essentially no flow of heat from the hot reservoir

387
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,710
to the core reservoir through the system. So

388
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,010
there's no work that can be done in the absence of

389
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:05,200
that heat flow. And even just a visual inspection,

390
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:10,780
this TV diagram, when we had if we had the high

391
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,810
low temperatures approaching each other, we saw

392
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,600
when we first introduced ISO therms that we would

393
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,690
cross the same isothermal with the same

394
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,530
temperature. The cycle would collapse to that

395
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,440
single process, just going back and forth along

396
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,280
the same isothermal, bringing in. The same amount

397
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,740
of heat from one reservoir was expelled to the

398
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,710
other reservoir and during the same amount of work

399
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,740
that has to be done on it to get back to the

400
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,370
starting point, nothing that can be used to

401
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,970
accomplish anything outside of the system.

402
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,670
So the efficiency vanishes in that limited.

403
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,700
Whereas in the opposite limits.

404
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,870
If the. Called Reservoir and picked up the

405
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,930
temperature much lower than the reservoir, and

406
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,830
this review itself approached zero. Then the

407
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,190
efficiency would approach its theoretical maximum

408
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,320
set by the first port of thermodynamics

409
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,770
approaching 100 percent efficiency.

410
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:24,230
Either going to one as that ratio of low

411
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:29,150
temperature, the high temperature goes to zero and

412
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:34,730
this is. Is generic result that heat engines like

413
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,960
the cardio cycle are more efficient as the.

414
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,970
Difference between the temperatures of their hot

415
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:46,460
and cold reservoir increases, it is also generic

416
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:51,050
that as the hot and cold temperatures approach

417
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:54,500
each other, there is no heating fuel and no work

418
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:59,700
that can be done as a consequence. What is

419
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:03,230
noteworthy about the Kano's cycle that we have

420
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,790
considered here? What is the reason we consider

421
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,430
this rather than some of the other cycles that

422
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:12,720
might be worth talking about in the tutorial, is

423
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,850
that this expression, the widest temperature ratio

424
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,930
that appears in this equation, 66, is actually the

425
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,040
maximum efficiency at any cycle that can possibly

426
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,000
have due to the second law of thermodynamics. So

427
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,360
we already put up or down with the efficiency from

428
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,770
the first law of the conservation of energy. If we

429
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,300
think about the second law.

430
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,200
That tells us that the. Then amount of energy in

431
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,990
the universe about the system and its surroundings

432
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,590
has to be not decreasing as these processes are

433
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,730
carried out and the system goes around its cycle.

434
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:01,740
So if we go back to our starting point today, that

435
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:07,050
relation between the nets, heat flow and the work

436
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,500
done coming from the first half of the team, we

437
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,550
can rewrite the numerator of the efficiency in

438
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:18,570
terms of the difference between the incoming and

439
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,920
outgoing heat. And this very quickly simplifies to

440
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,550
one minus the ratio of the wastage that is

441
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,220
expelled. The call reservoir compared to the.

442
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,330
Energy that is brought in the form of bottles of

443
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:38,240
water and from the definition of heat, as

444
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,630
temperature times change in entropy, we can relate

445
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:47,090
both of these factors in the ratio to the

446
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,560
corresponding temperature. Multiplied by the

447
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,850
change in entropy, going along the isothermal

448
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:59,620
process where this heat is being exchanged. So the

449
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,590
fact that those processes are isothermal is very

450
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,410
useful because of the temperature is a constant.

451
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,130
He flows out during the Depression concededly, the

452
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:14,150
system is fixed, the low temperature record

453
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,870
reservoir, and it flows in from the isotope

454
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,450
expansion from A to B.. The temperature is fixed

455
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:27,130
at the edge of the reservoir. And.

456
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:36,370
Once we have gone halfway around the cycle. The

457
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,620
system has returned to its original makeover

458
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,060
status. The amount of entropy in the system is the

459
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,810
same at the end as it was at the beginning. And

460
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:51,910
the only thing that can possibly be changed is

461
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:56,260
that the amount of entropy in the surroundings

462
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,080
might have might be different now that the system

463
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:06,460
has gone around the cycle. So as heat comes in to

464
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,640
the system in its expansion, that brings more

465
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,630
entropy from the reservoir into the system and

466
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,970
that entropy that has to flow out of the system

467
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,470
into the cold reservoir as he goes out. So in the

468
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:24,340
end, the amount of heat that is left of these

469
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:29,890
reservoirs is a decrease by that Delta s coming in

470
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:33,400
from the people coming into the expansion, which

471
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,420
must be smaller than the increase produced by

472
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:41,560
expelling waste heat to the whole reservoir. So.

473
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:46,130
Maybe just to connect with the balance, the

474
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:49,100
efficiency, we said earlier from the first law we

475
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:54,460
saw that this efficiency of ADA equals more, that

476
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,820
equality occurred only is on the screen. Equality

477
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,200
in this inequality occurs only when you have to

478
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,610
waste being expelled by the system. Varnishes

479
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,450
Second law says that the amount of waste can never

480
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,750
vanish because if it did that, entropy would be

481
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,260
vanishing as well in violation of of the Second

482
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,810
World. So plugging in this inequality that the

483
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:24,770
amount of entropy flowing out of the system has to

484
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,060
be greater than the total amount. The universe is

485
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,990
not decreasing.

486
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:36,980
They use this ratio is greater than or equal to

487
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,820
one, because we are subtracting the ratio, it

488
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,940
turns into a less than or equal sign in the

489
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,720
overall efficiency of any engine we could possibly

490
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,010
construct. Consistent with the second X is less

491
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:55,760
than or equal to this one minus the ratio of the

492
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,560
low temperature to the high temperature, and that

493
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,910
is independent of any engineering tricks we could

494
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,370
hope to play. That is a fundamental constraint

495
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,010
from the second law of thermodynamics and also

496
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,830
happens to be this equation. Sixty six that we

497
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:17,450
computed for the current cycle. So the participant

498
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:23,440
realizes the maximum possible efficiency that. If

499
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,550
that they possibly can.

500
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:35,650
During the final stages of the cycles of. So I

501
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:40,030
will wrap up by mentioning the possibility that we

502
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:45,450
could well take this kind of cycle and put it in

503
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,510
reverse, so instead of expanding the system at the

504
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,330
height of the horrors of war, that could be

505
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,620
absolutely sure that the contraction show that

506
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:02,180
create on chalkboards particularly visible. But

507
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,670
this is very simple exercise converts all these

508
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,900
Theros extension at the low temperature, the

509
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,550
causes of war to form a cycle that goes around the

510
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,390
same for processes in the opposite direction. So

511
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,480
what this is doing now, instead of having a net

512
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,870
amount of work being done by the system on its

513
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:29,070
surroundings, thanks to the flow of heat from the

514
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,680
hot reservoir to the cold reservoir, we've

515
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,880
reversed the science in all of our calculations on

516
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:40,770
the previous page. So what we're doing is moving

517
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:46,210
work. From the cold reservoir to the heat is

518
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,520
coming in from the cold reservoir. And are doing

519
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,120
work to bring in that heat and expel the heat out

520
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,290
the hot reservoir

521
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,780
at the price of having to do work on the system

522
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,200
rather than having the system do work for us. So

523
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,870
what's going on is that this process of removing

524
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:11,130
heat from a cold reservoir is ensuring that the

525
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,320
temperature of that cold reservoir remains low and

526
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:19,830
in fact, even lower. What this is doing is setting

527
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:23,880
up a refrigerator where the cold reservoir is

528
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,760
where we would keep our lunch. And we do work to

529
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,530
keep the temperature that cold reservoir cold by

530
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,650
shifting heat from us and expelling it into. The

531
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:40,260
reservoir formed by the external environment. So

532
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,180
that gives us a refrigerator rather than an engine,

533
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,740
instead of taking advantage of heat, so to do work,

534
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,360
we do work on the system in order to create a flow

535
00:38:54,360 --> 00:39:00,200
of heat and the analog of the efficiency. Or a

536
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,500
refrigerator is known as the coefficient of

537
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,880
performance and is defined in the same spirit as

538
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,140
the efficiency of what we care about is the amount

539
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,710
of heat that we are able to remove from the cold

540
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:19,730
reservoir. And the price for that heat is the

541
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,870
amount of work that has to be done on the system.

542
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,690
And as before taking it out, the balance of the

543
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,670
efficiency from the Second World through Anex

544
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:36,330
began. The place this difference in work with the

545
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:41,580
difference in heat and simplifies to find a

546
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:46,080
professional performance is one over the ratio of

547
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,440
the heat out of the system into the hot reservoir

548
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,690
divided by the heat flowing into the system from

549
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:56,190
the core reservoir minus one. And when we replace

550
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,710
that. With the inefficient inequality we derived

551
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:06,940
about. We actually find so we have the opposite

552
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,000
connection between the inflow and outflow of gates

553
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,510
and the hot or cold reservoirs. So this ratio.

554
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,170
Rather than being the ratio of the low temperature

555
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,630
to the high temperature for a refrigerator is the

556
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:24,230
ratio, the high temperature, low temperature and

557
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:29,090
the simplified gives a performance related to the

558
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:32,270
low temperature that we want to achieve, divided

559
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:35,210
by the difference between those two temperatures.

560
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:39,680
So this unlikely efficiency can be greater than

561
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,800
one, in fact, and that limit where the two

562
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,780
reservoirs have the same temperature. We see that

563
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:50,370
a divergence which makes sense if the. The looks

564
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,380
have returned the body, but we want to refrigerate

565
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,160
is already as cold as the high temperatures and

566
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,470
the rest of its surroundings, then there's no work

567
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,230
that has to be done in order to keep that low

568
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,100
temperature level.

569
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:09,740
And I will say that we're practical refrigerators

570
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,380
you might have in the kitchen, the typical value

571
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,440
of this coefficient of performance is around five

572
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:22,960
to six. So clearly greater than one and. The final

573
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,660
remark for this year, the ultimate inevitable

574
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:30,450
cycles, is. I related to the efficiency and

575
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:33,330
cooperation of performance of real devices.

576
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,960
What we might talk about the tutorial on Friday is

577
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:45,840
that real devices are. Not the kind of a cycle, so

578
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,490
even though the cycle realizes the maximum

579
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:53,040
possible efficiency for you from the tank engine,

580
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:59,000
it is not a practical way to use heat to do work.

581
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,210
And that is because it is too slow, especially

582
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,090
because it has to have those two isothermal

583
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:11,080
stations for expansion and contraction, isothermal

584
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:14,890
means that process is slow enough for all possible

585
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,890
heat exchange occurs.

586
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,160
And if we want an actual engine like an internal

587
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,370
combustion engine. Were these sort of engines that

588
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:29,250
we have powered refrigerators, they have to

589
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,520
sacrifice the theoretical efficiency of the cargo

590
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,510
cycle for the practicalities of operating on

591
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:41,650
timescales of. Seconds or less rather than hours

592
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:48,340
or days, so. I pushed through it to complete this

593
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:53,080
before, but we have had today let's pause now to

594
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,800
see if there are any questions about the

595
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,060
efficiency of the kind of cycle. Or refrigerators.

596
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:29,180
Not hearing any just. You've won last. Saying

597
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,880
about the efficiency of Olympic cycles, I

598
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,960
mentioned at the start that the first off to the

599
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:41,860
next ensures that we can't win within the next

600
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,210
cycle. We can't make a actual motion machine that

601
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,770
puts out more work than it takes in the four feet.

602
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:55,860
Second level increase in energy is telling us that

603
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:02,150
not only can we not win. It's also possible to

604
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:07,040
break even the work that we get out of the engine

605
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,820
always has to be less than the amount of energy

606
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,940
flowing through it. And fortunately for the. So

607
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,380
just a few minutes left today, not hearing any

608
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,350
questions about whether they had a fight with law

609
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,040
at least motivates the next topic in the module.

610
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,110
Which is getting back to the more formal

611
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:37,440
developments of statistical ensembles. In

612
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,880
particular, developing the grand, fanatical

613
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,260
ensemble, so since there are just a few minutes

614
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,260
remaining, I'll speak loosely, qualitatively for

615
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:51,300
the time being. We're thinking back to what we've

616
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,380
done so far before, digging into some details of

617
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:58,980
the gases and their use in thermodynamic cycles.

618
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:06,600
We started off with the first statistical example

619
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,410
we considered was the microeconomic ensemble,

620
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:15,000
which directly connected to the conservation of

621
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:19,380
energy. The first law from the banks by requiring

622
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,880
that the energy of any system described when it

623
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:27,420
has to be fixed as that system evolves, a time

624
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,690
adopting its various microstates that turned out

625
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:33,330
to be impractical for.

626
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:39,390
Use it for use in interesting situations like the

627
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,480
Matrix cycles, so we quickly replaced it with the

628
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,010
canonical ensemble where instead of keeping the

629
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,230
internal energy of the system fixed, we allowed

630
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,320
the energy to fluctuate by exchanging energy

631
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:58,650
through verbal contact with a large external

632
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:02,850
thermal reservoir that in turn fixed the

633
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,460
temperature of. While still keeping that political

634
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:10,630
no fixed and the economic ensemble essentially

635
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:15,950
fills in the other piece of that development. So

636
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,360
we now allow the. Article number, as well as the

637
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:27,880
energy to fluctuate. By being exchanged with a

638
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,870
large external reservoir of a different sort. This

639
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:35,360
is the this will be one of the developments,

640
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:39,640
formerly a particle reservoir. With which the

641
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:43,720
system of interest can exchange both energy as

642
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,320
well as its particles to the number of particles

643
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,460
in the system will no longer be fixed. In the same

644
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,920
way that the system's energy will no longer be

645
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,760
fixed. But there will be two other qualities that

646
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,500
are fixed through this contact with the particle

647
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:05,350
of one of those is the temperature, as we saw, for

648
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:10,210
the canonical ensemble. The other one will be a

649
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:14,720
quantity known as the chemical potential, which is

650
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,410
a little certainly much less familiar than the

651
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:20,440
temperature. So we'll get into that tomorrow

652
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,870
morning. I guess the.

653
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:30,860
The details of what exactly is fixed by allowing

654
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,860
particles to be exchanged between the system and

655
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,720
its surroundings is.

656
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,500
A bit more of a calculation than. We have time to

657
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,380
go into right now. We'll pick it up tomorrow

658
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,410
morning and.

659
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:53,500
You flesh out this basic idea of having started

660
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,390
with fixed energy and particle, no, not without

661
00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:00,430
both of those two very fixed to other quantities

662
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:04,330
instead through contact with the large external

663
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,140
reservoir. I'll wrap it up there and invite any

664
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:12,040
more questions. I'll be setting up the office

665
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:19,670
hours and. Ten minutes or so and. If there are. No

666
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:23,700
further questions. See you all again. Tomorrow,

667
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,890
we're in the other room.

668
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:28,590
Well.

669
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,240
Once again, the.
