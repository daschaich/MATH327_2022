1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,360
All right, we might as well get under way this morning.

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,940
We'll see how this microphone holds up after not being

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,520
plugged in overnight.  And we'll start as always with six

4
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,370
code for today: nine one one, two oh seven.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,810
With that we can pretty much pick up and keep going from where we got up

6
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:41,000
to yesterday afternoon, after the extended check-in

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,650
with logistics and the recap of the first three

8
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,860
quarters of the module.  We got motivation from phase

9
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,770
transitions to look at interacting systems and

10
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,490
then defined what exactly interactions amount

11
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:00,050
to in terms of how the internal energy of the

12
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,210
system changes, upon making a change to any one of its

13
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,780
degrees of freedom. It's non-interacting if that

14
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,720
change is independent of all the other degrees of

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,540
freedom, except for that one, it is interacting

16
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:21,530
otherwise. And we introduced this simple internal

17
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,300
energy for a system of spins on a lattice. That

18
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,750
includes now the contribution to the energy coming

19
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,370
from a product of two spin's. That.

20
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,370
We can give you mentioned before going into the

21
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,430
details that given the negative signs that are

22
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,040
coming with each term here. There is a energy

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,830
preference to get to the lowest or most negative

24
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,800
energy, but from aligning the spins with that

25
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,800
external magnetic field H in the second term, that

26
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,200
corresponds to a value spin that is plus one. And

27
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,150
assuming that this is greater than zero and that

28
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,370
gives a negative energy, and the way to get the

29
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,030
negative energy of the first term is to have these

30
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,010
two spins on their nearest neighbor sites have the

31
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,800
same value that is point to the same direction. We

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,560
would end up without a plus one squared, minus one

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,680
squared there. The overall negative side then

34
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,920
gives another negative contribution, lowering the

35
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,430
energy.

36
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,390
As is preferred by the bolson factors and

37
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,430
canonical sample that we derived back back in

38
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,140
March. So if there are any immediate questions

39
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,530
about.

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,190
Those. Aspects of what we went through yesterday,

41
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,070
this is a chance to shout them out, otherwise you

42
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:58,230
can keep moving forward with the observation that.

43
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,140
There is one more ingredient just beyond the. Form

44
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,870
of how these spin degrees of freedom are being

45
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,890
multiplied together, and that is the sum over the

46
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,400
parenthesis JDK something over all of the pairs of

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,640
nearest neighbor spoons in our lettuce, it depends

48
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,790
on the latest that we have that we work with,

49
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,730
which can either be something that is fixed by

50
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,190
nature or if we're dealing with different crystals,

51
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,830
they can come up with different structures or

52
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,970
we're interested just in the mathematical aspects

53
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,880
of the systems. We can imagine all sorts of

54
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,220
different lattices with different ways or nearest

55
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,850
neighbors to be distributed. So at least for the

56
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,300
first pass through, we will focus on what are

57
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,660
called simple cubic gladys's. We drew a couple of

58
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,630
examples in one and two dimensions yesterday, and

59
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,390
one of the gaps in these figures are illustrating

60
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,890
some of these features of these simple cubic

61
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:08,440
gladys's in two dimensions on the left and. A

62
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,150
three dimensional, three dimensional, simple cubic

63
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,400
lattice of the right, where we can see in the case

64
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,000
of two dimensions, for instance, that if we pick

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,570
out any given site or spin that we're now

66
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,140
representing as a solid circle every point rather

67
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,830
than an up or down arrow just for simplicity as we

68
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:36,610
look at these higher dimensions. It has. The four

69
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,410
nearest neighbors, which not coincidentally, is

70
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,440
twice the number of connections, so each of the

71
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,010
two dimensions, we can go forward or back, left or

72
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,240
right from our base site as well as up or down.

73
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,310
And in between each of these pairs of nearest

74
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,900
neighbors, we can draw a solid line known as a

75
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,780
link. So what is back on the previous page between

76
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,560
nearest neighbor sites? We have a regular grid

77
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,400
that we can draw links and look at. In this simple,

78
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,810
ubiquitous case, the sets of nearest neighbor

79
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,470
pairs of sites that we have to sum over in our new

80
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,050
expression for the internal energy correspond

81
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,520
exactly to each of these links. So in this case,

82
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,940
the four nearest neighbors correspond to the four

83
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,980
links. And I've marked in a little red hatch there.

84
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,980
And here in three dimensions, we have

85
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,410
illustrations of links going forward to be right

86
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,750
up or off into that third dimension. We've sort of

87
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,010
projected onto the plane here, the human eye piece

88
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,630
of paper and as we go.

89
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,930
To higher dimensions with these little structures,

90
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,800
there are additional higher dimensional elementary

91
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,760
objects that we can start to consider.

92
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,830
So the. Two dimensional elementary units of

93
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:22,310
surface area. Yes. I laid it over here and can

94
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,760
also be seen interventions is known as a catch.

95
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,200
And once we get up to that three dimensional

96
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,740
elementary unit of volume, that's just a cube and

97
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,350
we have a simple cubic lattice and one attempt to

98
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,180
draw any cubes out here, we can generalize all of

99
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,530
this to higher and higher numbers of dimensions.

100
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,290
We have so called hypercube classes and we're the

101
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:58,060
elementary units of the. To the of the dimensional

102
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,890
universe is known as the hypercube, just the

103
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:07,600
product of a single link in all of the available

104
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:13,240
dimensions to. The D in which we are operating

105
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,930
will stop. So because we have to sum over all of

106
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,950
these nearest neighbor pairs that correspond to

107
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,790
the links in order to compute the internal energy,

108
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,600
that's the basis of our interacting system on

109
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,440
these simple cubic gladys's. We may need to worry

110
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,060
about what exactly happens if we tip the edge of a

111
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,310
planet like this and this is relevant since.

112
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,630
Everything in nature is finite, so what happens

113
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,470
with this link, for example, that is dangling off

114
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,300
the bottom of our two dimensional wires here? The

115
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,870
simplest way to approach this, the one that we

116
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,230
will do, I think without exception in this module

117
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,950
and is done in most research, is to suppose that

118
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,670
this link down at the bottom here is the same link

119
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,280
that comes off at the top. There they are

120
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,850
identified. This is something known as periodic

121
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:24,300
boundary conditions, which is saying that once. We

122
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,990
encounter in any side or. The site of the latest

123
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,300
in a number of dimensions. Links that go off to

124
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,320
the edge of what we choose to draw and simply wrap

125
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,720
back around to the other side of the lattice, it's

126
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,320
similar to a classic arcade game, Pacman, where if

127
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,500
you go off the video screen and any one of the

128
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,060
dimensions, the

129
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,010
character immediately appears to be bottom of the

130
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:59,170
opposite side. So there are a couple of ways the

131
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,330
periodic boundary conditions can. People will be

132
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:09,850
confusing if you think about the. In. In a

133
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,720
different way than we have in mind, so the first

134
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,140
thing to note is that all of these links are

135
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,420
essentially the same length. All the nearest

136
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,940
neighbors are the same distance away from each

137
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,230
other. Even when we have to wrap around from the

138
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,810
left of the lands that we've drawn back around to

139
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,300
the right. And it's still the same distance away

140
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,940
as any of the other links in the system. So.

141
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:45,230
We can emphasize this. By drawing a line of

142
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,100
structure with periodic boundary conditions in

143
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,050
this sort of way, as this is a one dimensional

144
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,420
lattice, so there are just one direction we can

145
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,940
move from one dimension which we can move forward

146
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,250
or back from any given site. So there are two

147
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,250
nearest neighbors for each of these sites and we

148
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,610
have sort of come around. Periodic boundary

149
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,760
conditions to connect the links that were

150
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,000
identified at the left and right edges of this one

151
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,340
dimensional lattice, ending up with something

152
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,120
represented as a circle on this two dimensional

153
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,470
sheet of paper. So this emphasizes that there is

154
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,070
still constant separation between all of the sites

155
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,150
in the lattice. But it can introduce a different

156
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,190
misconception, which is that periodic boundary

157
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,000
conditions might induce some curvature in the way

158
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,270
that we have turned this one dimensional lattice

159
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,460
that used to be a straight line into something

160
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,480
that looks like a circle. What what's really going

161
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,690
on is that this impression of curvature is a

162
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,660
consequence of how we are visualizing the system

163
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,410
being drawn on a two dimensional sheet of paper.

164
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,920
And really, this is still a straight line we are

165
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,770
just representing it in. This visual way for

166
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,550
convenience, and this, of course, generalizes to

167
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,940
all of the higher dimensional structures. So if

168
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,290
you have two dimensions, as in this example up

169
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,620
here and you identify both the left and right

170
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,240
edges and the top and bottom edges. You may well

171
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,730
have seen the previous modules end up with a

172
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,080
tortoise, a doughnut that looks curved, if we

173
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,030
imagine it being embedded into three dimensional

174
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,510
space atop a logically, it is a flat structure,

175
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,440
just the same absence of curvature as the sheet of

176
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,370
paper that we have written it on up here. So the

177
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,230
periodic boundary conditions.

178
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,730
Don't change any distances between the sites,

179
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,170
they're all separated by the same distance and

180
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,480
they don't introduce any curvature, we'll end up

181
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:10,030
with flat Tauri. Introduced to this circle in one

182
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,660
dimension, the usual toreson for a two dimensional

183
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,960
system of higher dimensional hypersaline as we go

184
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,090
up in the higher number of dimensions. So just

185
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,610
check to see that there are no objections to.

186
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,960
Those details about the letter structures that are

187
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,310
underlying this system we're considering now.

188
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,150
And if it did come up, feel free to shout them out

189
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:46,060
with this. Underlying basis, all established, we

190
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:53,040
can start to. Specify some of the details of the

191
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,770
system in general, in particular counting the

192
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,100
number of links that we have, depending on the

193
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,550
number of dimensions that we are considering. So

194
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,640
in this one dimensional case, it's easy to see

195
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,190
that there are the total number of links. So each

196
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,830
site has two nearest neighbours corresponding to

197
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,100
two links attached to it, but each link is

198
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,440
attached to two of these sites. So if we were to

199
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,730
count to ten links, all of the ones that connect

200
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,410
to all of the sites here, we would have to divide

201
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,010
that by two to account for the double counting of

202
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:40,330
each link. Being attached to two of those sites,

203
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,820
so that is to say that the total number of links

204
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,230
for this whole system is to an over to August and

205
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,380
she gets we can also see by going around and

206
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:57,110
counting. The number of sites up to end and then

207
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,160
the number of links in between them also up to nd

208
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,940
in this very simple one dimensional case, and if

209
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,580
we look back to the two dimensional lattice, we

210
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,240
can tell that same sort of story that we saw. Each

211
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,090
site has Fournier's neighbors forward or backward

212
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,570
in each of the two dimensions. We still have two

213
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,850
sites connected to each link. So the total number

214
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,870
of links, which I'm just calling the number times

215
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:31,760
now, is then those. Fournier's neighbors divided

216
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,530
by two links for two sites per link for each of

217
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:41,480
the sites. Let us and we can generalize this to.

218
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,920
The dimensional case, again, with periodic

219
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,460
boundary conditions to keep all of the sites the

220
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:56,750
same the same number of links. So. Indeed, it

221
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,990
mentions. You will have these to the

222
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,690
links that attach to every site moving forward or

223
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,740
backward in almost every one of these dimensions,

224
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,970
as always, there are two sites. Shearing.

225
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,930
Each of these. Linc's.

226
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,970
And if we put those two facts together, then we

227
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,730
end up with the total number of links is two times

228
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,120
in.

229
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,570
For two days, links from each of the sites in the

230
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,010
system and then divided by two to correct four

231
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,850
double counting, so just ending up with the times

232
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,880
and try to leave a dot in between and look like a

233
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:56,790
differential factor. And that's the total number

234
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,640
of links or the total number of nearest neighbor

235
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:05,460
terms in the energy we are considering that

236
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,420
defines this interacting spin system to a number

237
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,720
of terms. That person knows both with the number

238
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,960
of sites and the system, as well as the number of

239
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,530
dimensions of the states are distributed across.

240
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,390
So. Now that we have both the.

241
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,050
Equation for the internal energy that and as well

242
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,650
as the underlying. Hypercube, a structure that

243
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,980
defines where the nearest neighbor terms, where

244
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,090
the two students get multiplied together to

245
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,220
contribute to the energy. What we end up with is a

246
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:00,310
system known as the easy model on accumulates in

247
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,920
these dimensions, that is.

248
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,480
The title of this section is not surprised that we

249
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,340
are encountering this terminology, it's called the

250
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,390
easy model because it was invented by us, you'll

251
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,550
have Lence. And what happened historically is sort

252
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,050
of fascinating story that you'll have. I was

253
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,710
trying to come up with a model for Ferromagnetic,

254
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:31,070
the way that certain types of materials can pick

255
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,390
up a overall collective magnetization depending on

256
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,820
their temperature. And had the idea that. Coming

257
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,020
in tonight in 1920 with the new consensus that

258
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,370
these materials are made up of of molecules and

259
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,520
suppose that each of those molecules has a

260
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,540
magnetic dipole structure of its own, which can

261
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:02,720
either add up or cancel out to provide this large

262
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:07,760
scale deterministic response or not. The idea was

263
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,830
that depending on the temperature, the least

264
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,320
magnetic poles represented as the been working

265
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,810
with would. Alive or not, if you find a Ph.D.

266
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,340
students and it's easy to actually solve

267
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,360
mathematically the. This qualitative conjecture

268
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,380
that the simple speed system we have presented

269
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,820
would. Describe magnetism, so using did this a few

270
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,840
years later, working just in the one dimensional

271
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,600
case, if you could solve. Exactly. And finding

272
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,610
that the results did not agree with experiments,

273
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,080
even for these one dimensional materials of.

274
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,210
Essentially a straight line system of magnets, and

275
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:08,520
it was only about 20 years later that anyone with

276
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,880
the mathematical capabilities to solve the two

277
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,530
dimensional case came along. Fellow by the name of

278
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,690
Flores on Zagor. Who was eventually to receive the

279
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,080
Nobel Prize for different work, but in in the

280
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,590
nineteen forties, exactly solved the two

281
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,890
dimensional system, at least in the case of zero

282
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,880
feel this age going to zero and was able to show

283
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,950
that indeed it behave differently from the one

284
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,370
dimensional case and in much better agreements

285
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,860
with a wide variety of phase transitions, as we

286
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,480
will see going forward.

287
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,280
And.

288
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,300
Things really took off again a couple decades

289
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,640
after that, so starting in the 1960s with some

290
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,400
further work on especially these two dimensional,

291
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,780
higher dimensional cases, it was realised that

292
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,620
these simple open systems could be applied not

293
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,150
only to magnetism, but to essentially any system

294
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,670
where there are two possibilities that you can

295
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,700
distinguish between. So things like neural

296
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,760
networks where neurons are firing or not, things

297
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,690
like segregation in cities where people are

298
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,250
similar to their neighbors or not. And there have

299
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,760
been thousands of scientific studies summarized by

300
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,210
this little magazine article that I have uploaded

301
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:46,520
to the canvass site, not a cartoon picture of

302
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,540
magnet's that is being used for all sorts of

303
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,710
applications. In addition, just to the fair

304
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,160
magnetism it started from. But we will have a

305
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,450
chance to see some of those later on. For now,

306
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,630
I'll mention that if we go up from two dimensions

307
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,870
to three dimensions, there is no known exact

308
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:14,780
solution and such a solution may not even exist.

309
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,970
We have to take a different approach to analyze

310
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,050
using model once we get above two dimensions and

311
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,350
we can appreciate the difficulties just by.

312
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,530
Looking at the economical production function for

313
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,120
this theory, that, of course, is based on the

314
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,310
energy we have written down, it depends on the

315
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,870
configuration of all of these and spins as well as.

316
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:50,630
On the set of nearest neighbor pairs that are

317
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:55,220
interacting with each other under our formal

318
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:01,010
definition of interactions. So due to the overall

319
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,130
production function, of course, is the sum overall

320
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,920
microstates, each micro state is defined by a

321
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,200
different configuration of the skin. So there are

322
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,220
two to the power and total microstates, as we've

323
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,950
seen for the not the tracking systems. So.

324
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:24,000
Solving the easy model would amount to coming up

325
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,760
with a. Nice analytica, close form expression for

326
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,290
what here is a sum of exponentially better

327
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,460
exponential factors, each of which has

328
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,920
three times, and then plus in terms within the

329
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,960
exponential and importantly due to the interactive

330
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,020
nature of that first term where changes changes in

331
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,410
energy with a positive change in the spin, SJP

332
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,800
also depend on all the nearest neighbor Spoon's

333
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,460
ask.

334
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,910
That means that you're no longer able to factories

335
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,880
this partition function the way that we could for

336
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,800
the down the track in case that only had the

337
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,000
magnetic field turn to eight times the sum of all

338
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,250
the things that gave us the equation. Forty one,

339
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:17,320
which was just the powers of identical, hyperbolic,

340
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,070
cosine terms. Without that, we're just stuck with

341
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,990
this exponentially large sum exponential with no

342
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,110
known exact solution, once we get up to three

343
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,270
dimensions where there are six nearest neighbor

344
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:31,810
terms.

345
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,180
For each of the spins that are double counted in

346
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,220
that first term, so even if we try to do a brute

347
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,730
force evaluation of this partition function.

348
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,830
That also runs into the same issue of a rapidly

349
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:57,140
exploding number of terms. So if we drop down from

350
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,530
our usual 10 to the power, twenty three to just

351
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,190
ten, twenty three spends a little over a thousand.

352
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,490
So simplifying the system by 20 orders of

353
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,260
magnitude and size and to give a number of

354
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:15,310
dimensions and we can see that. There are going to

355
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:19,510
be two to the N terms, to the thousand power is

356
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:25,480
roughly three hundred in terms. Which if we were

357
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:30,520
to try to evaluate on any existing or foreseeable

358
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,340
supercomputer, would take well beyond the reach of

359
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:39,880
the universe to not to complete. So we have to be

360
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,120
a bit more clever about how we analyze the

361
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,530
interacting easing model. We can't exactly solve

362
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:51,960
the partition function in. Any more than two

363
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,970
dimensions of a two dimensional case, it's

364
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,960
really a tour de force of. Mathematical analysis,

365
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,430
so famously complicated calculation.

366
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,780
So we also can't numerically evaluate this, but we

367
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,680
will have to do is simplify things and we will

368
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,520
dive into that in the time remaining unless there

369
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,630
are questions about. The U.S. model models we have

370
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,980
now to finance and the aspects of it that we have

371
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,450
highlighted.

372
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:39,250
And not seeing anything, we can move on to the

373
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,000
simplification strategy, which not too

374
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,210
surprisingly is.

375
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,210
The same one that we employed in the not

376
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:52,200
interesting case where we consider the extreme

377
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,700
limits of the system and in particular, we'll do a

378
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,920
couple of things. We will look at the limit where

379
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,920
this external magnetic field vanishes. So we'll

380
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,600
set each equal to zero and get the energy down to

381
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:13,290
a single start, a single term expression that just

382
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:20,410
has the. Yes, there were some times escape, so

383
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,280
with that magnetic field turned off, we have at

384
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,280
least a shorter expression to right for the

385
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,810
protection function, but still one with

386
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:35,070
exponentially exponential. And we will, in the

387
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,160
zero field case, consider what happens at

388
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:44,270
asymptotically high and low temperatures. Where we

389
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,020
can expect some aspects of the system to simplify,

390
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,830
some microstates to be relevant, some others to to

391
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:57,620
dominate and just to give a forecast of what will

392
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:02,150
be driving for in this next stage of our analysis

393
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:06,650
of using model, we will see. Not too surprisingly,

394
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,060
that have high temperatures. The behavior of the

395
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,780
system is qualitatively different than the system

396
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,530
at low temperatures. This is also what we saw in

397
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,770
the economy, tracking cases, and we can identify

398
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,580
each of these high and low temperature limits as

399
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:32,100
distinct phases of the system, similar to the

400
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,320
phases that we talked about more qualitatively

401
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,690
yesterday, like the actual steam at high

402
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,210
temperatures compared to liquid water at lower

403
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:47,070
temperatures. This allows for there to be a phase

404
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:52,340
transition between these two phases. But that is

405
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,620
not a priority guaranteed because there is a

406
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,360
specific meaning to a mathematical meaning and

407
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,230
definition to what we mean. We talk about a true

408
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,200
phased transition, which is what we will wrap up

409
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,190
this section by

410
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,040
spelling out in the context of the easy model. So

411
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:18,650
if we just have two different phases to different

412
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,690
types of behavior at high and low temperatures,

413
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,490
then either be a true rapid transition between

414
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,790
them or just a gradual evolution from one of those

415
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,820
limits to the next. As that control parameter, the

416
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,900
temperature is very low. That gets called a

417
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,930
crossover in contrast to a phase transition. And

418
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,530
we will see as we see, the first step is to

419
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,430
delineate these two different phases and then we

420
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,910
will define the difference between that phase

421
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,760
transition and the crossover between them and then

422
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,880
move on to try to establish which of those two

423
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,120
possibilities, phase transition or crossover is

424
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,790
realized by the easy model, both within and

425
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:12,710
without a external magnetic field. So that's the

426
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:18,320
plan for probably the rest of today. So we'll get

427
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,540
underway with the high temperature regime. So in

428
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,970
the asymptotic minute where the temperature goes

429
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,130
to zero, it's been a while since we've seen data.

430
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,670
So we recall that that is the inverse temperature.

431
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,360
Well, as promised, there is a significant

432
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,180
simplification of the partition function in this

433
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:38,600
case.

434
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,230
We have from this equation one child that is still

435
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,680
at the top of the screen, that petition function

436
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:53,540
is the sum over all configurations of our spins

437
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,480
and the exponential factor of that percentage of

438
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,630
the times, the sum of all, in your standard terms,

439
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:06,130
sending it to zero except some just zero. So that

440
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:12,910
picks up just counting that one for every single

441
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,000
spin configuration of which there are two to the

442
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,020
power and available. So this is looking a lot like

443
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:28,970
the not attracting. Case that we had earlier, in

444
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,580
the absence of an external feel, every.

445
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:37,970
Configuration, independent of its actual internal

446
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:43,380
energy, is adopted with the same probability. As

447
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,450
always, working in the dynamic equilibrium, so in

448
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,300
effect, we can physically what's going on here is

449
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:57,770
that the. Temperature is so large that the energy

450
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:01,040
coming from the village of Orientation's all of

451
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,760
these new receiver spins is irrelevant.

452
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,650
Whether the spins are aligned with each other,

453
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,910
reducing the energy or one opposite with each

454
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,940
other, increasing the energy makes no effect to

455
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,830
the overall behavior of the system, all of which

456
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,250
is dominated by the huge amount of thermal energy

457
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,990
that is sloshing around.

458
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:29,600
So. What we can do to characterize this system

459
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,410
where the internal energy is irrelevant is

460
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:37,920
consider a slightly different observable. And in

461
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,170
fact, a simpler one. That came up yesterday in the

462
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,140
context of the final homework assignment. This is

463
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,240
the magnetization of the system, a bit of

464
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,340
terminology coming from the historical roots of

465
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,960
this model as a model of romanticism. But what

466
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,450
this is, is just counting the. Total number of

467
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:11,330
upper pointing spins minus the downward spins. So

468
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,010
initially we define up and down with reference to

469
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,120
external magnetic field, the skins with the value

470
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,340
of plus one that were considered to be aligned

471
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,850
with the field minus one or against it. Now that

472
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,740
we don't have the field, we can still keep that

473
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,750
same definition of spin having plus or minus one

474
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,820
to state oriented up or down. There's just no

475
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:39,110
energetic preference for a spin to be pointed out

476
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:44,730
as opposed to being put down. I guess they decide

477
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:49,570
I have time to fit in here, is that this reveals

478
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:55,830
that symmetry of the zero field case. So once you

479
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:59,100
remove that external feel and don't have it to.

480
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,660
Prefer one direction or the other. We can flip

481
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,870
every single spin in the of system without

482
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,860
changing internal energy or anything other than

483
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:16,450
the overall sign of this magnetization. So.

484
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:20,110
There's nothing in the absence of external field

485
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:24,610
to distinguish a system up from one with all the

486
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,400
spins pointed down, or similarly, if we have a

487
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,700
complicated microstates with lots of upward and

488
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,790
downward sprinkled around, if we flip all of them

489
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:39,330
at the same time, we end up with. Effectively, the

490
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,840
same physical system from the.

491
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,910
Corresponding opposite microstates, so of the

492
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:53,460
microstates are carrying up these pairs related by

493
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:57,360
symmetry, transformation, flipping all of the

494
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,360
spins at the same time.

495
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:07,130
So getting back to station. We will typically

496
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:12,170
normalize it by the total number of spins. And

497
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:15,490
what this does is just make it easier to compare

498
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,760
systems of different sizes so the decision has a

499
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,910
value that is always between minus one, plus one.

500
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,930
Speaking of the this is lower case than. So it's

501
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:33,660
now the difference between the plus one minus the

502
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,110
minus hospitals divided by the total number of

503
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:43,140
plus and minus spins, and in order to account for

504
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,440
that symmetry, I mentioned the absence of external

505
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,610
fuel. It also makes sense to focus on the absolute

506
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:56,120
value of the U.S. so that we don't pick up

507
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,470
duplicate copies of just different biocide, how to

508
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,180
find that symmetry, transformation, something all

509
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,850
of these systems at once. So have some value that

510
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,150
ranges from zero to more than the limit zero sum.

511
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,380
There are people numbers of positive and negative

512
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:15,910
skills.

513
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,430
And the limit of one is by all of the skins are

514
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:27,380
either a plus or minus, and there's no difference

515
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,300
between those two microstates.

516
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,500
So what we want to do is. Figure out the

517
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,680
expectation value of romanticisation in our

518
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,640
high-temperature limit.

519
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:48,050
We do that in the usual way that the expectation

520
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:53,780
value of any observable is a value that observable.

521
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:57,110
We're getting the microstates, some deverall, the

522
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,890
microstates, so. And by.

523
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:07,340
The probability for the system to adopt that

524
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:11,030
microstates we have seen that all of the

525
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,450
microstates have an equal probability of one over

526
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:21,380
to. So the expectation value is just going to

527
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:26,690
depend on. How many of these equally probable

528
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:30,570
microstates have particular values of the

529
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:34,700
magnetization so we can pull out that constant?

530
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,740
Probably have military control over to them and

531
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,200
see that the expectation value is just related to

532
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,730
the sum of all of the major decisions for all the

533
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,590
microstates that will be dominated by.

534
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:59,650
The most probable value for this magnetization. So.

535
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:01,810
This is.

536
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,040
Again, because the energy is not playing any role

537
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,140
in the coming days, this is producing effectively

538
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,630
what we already considered it for, the non

539
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:15,320
distracted case. Where as an example, we looked at

540
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:18,590
the ground state of the system and we saw that

541
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:23,450
there were just two microstates with that maximum

542
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:28,310
mobilization of one where all of the end spins are

543
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:34,850
either plus one or on spins or minus one. And this

544
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,450
is, of course, a special case of the binomial

545
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:42,050
coefficient factorial that we are used to seeing

546
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,350
in this context, where the number of states with a

547
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:49,940
given number of upward pointing spins. Out of the

548
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:53,930
total is just the binomial coefficient, the ratio

549
00:37:54,470 --> 00:38:00,680
of these factorial factors which are now

550
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:06,370
sufficiently familiar with to recall that the

551
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:11,930
spinal cord deficient has a narrow peak around the.

552
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,390
Limit where half of these things are pointing up

553
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,370
and the other half are pointing down.

554
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,300
So not only is that.

555
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,170
So the microphone has died from not being plugged

556
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:37,020
in, get him to stop beeping at us. So not only are

557
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:42,090
there more microstates with a roughly even number

558
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:46,440
of distribution, even number or equal number of

559
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,270
upward pointing it down expense.

560
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:55,940
There are enormously larger numbers of microstates

561
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,960
in that regime where the magnetization, the

562
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,500
difference between the number of upper pointing

563
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,210
and Dalrymple's expense is small or varnishing,

564
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,590
which is to say that the main position is. Towards

565
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:17,860
its lower limits of zero. So what we have overall

566
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:24,760
is the expectation value that's just counting the

567
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:30,520
numbers of states is going to approach zero as the

568
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,950
number of degrees of freedom in the system. Is

569
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:39,330
increasing the peak that we have in the spine that

570
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,030
we'll factor distribution becomes narrower and

571
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:48,180
narrower as it increases and this limit of and

572
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,760
going to an infinite number of degrees of freedom

573
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,650
is. Just that through the limits that we mentioned

574
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,650
yesterday, it shows up in the final homework

575
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:04,280
assignment as the. Limit in which the canonical

576
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:10,040
canonical examples are effectively equivalent. On.

577
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,760
So in that limit, we have.

578
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,220
Absolute value of the mechanization effect of

579
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:22,210
vanishing for any final, and we will have at high

580
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:27,100
temperatures a small value of the mechanization,

581
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,010
close to zero, it can be closer to zero as it

582
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:37,290
increases and. This we'd describe or we call a

583
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,620
disordered phase of the system where there are

584
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,550
roughly equal numbers of upward and downward spins

585
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:48,600
and no overall pattern to how those upper

586
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,120
Delaporte expense are distributed.

587
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,020
Across the US, it's all all disordered and.

588
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,400
I think we have plenty of time to get through the

589
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,450
opposite lower temperature limit where we. Can

590
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,580
expect, as advertised, something different to

591
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:18,060
happen, so this is the case in which the

592
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,680
temperature is becoming very large, going to

593
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,890
infinity, and we want to determine the

594
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,820
magnetization here. And.

595
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,740
In the same sort of way as we saw, we're not

596
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:36,120
interactive systems, we now have this both form

597
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,690
factor, the exponential of the speed of times, the

598
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:40,170
energy.

599
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,990
That appears in the canonical petition function,

600
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,190
equation 112 as Peter. Becomes large as opposed to

601
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:56,780
small disposable factors, exponentially enhancing

602
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,860
the preference for enhancing the probability where

603
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:04,710
the system will. Adopt, for example, sampling

604
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:07,560
microstates where there is a lower or more

605
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:13,540
negative value of the energy. So as the sum of all

606
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,110
your neighbors becomes more negative. And gets

607
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,930
multiplied by the large indoor temperature and the

608
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:23,620
low temperature regime. We have it exponential,

609
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,710
the very large negative number which approaches

610
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,190
one.

611
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,220
Whereas the.

612
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:44,380
The opposite regime we have, the very large

613
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,720
positive number has that exponential suppression

614
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:53,000
that we saw before and we'll see you again. If I

615
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,940
move more quickly through the rest of this, this

616
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:03,680
on Friday, but what we can expect is just as we

617
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,400
saw the opportunity for the tracking system, the

618
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,630
ground states should dominate the expectation

619
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,470
value for any of your including that magnetization.

620
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:21,980
And the impact on the expectation value from

621
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,840
higher energy microstates will be exponentially

622
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,500
suppressed. And we've seen already that there are

623
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:36,600
to be generally ground states. When the. External

624
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,430
field of the easy model, Danishes.

625
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:46,820
In which case all of the spins are. Aligned in

626
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:51,760
either the two directions. And it becomes easy to

627
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:59,510
confuse the. Energy of. Both of these ground

628
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,900
states, energy is just the beginning. Some of the

629
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,120
product spends on sites.

630
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,140
Since these spins are always aligned in the same

631
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:18,530
direction, both as I and as as came in the ground

632
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:23,040
state will be both plus one or both minus once

633
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,590
there are two factors, plus or minus one, the

634
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,660
negative signs, will that cancel in that square

635
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,530
again? Just something over the number of newspaper

636
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:39,210
pairs with the sign. That was these times and in

637
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,200
these dimensions, so the overall energy is picking

638
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:50,030
up a minus one contribution. From everyone. Of the

639
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,510
new types and links in the latest.

640
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:58,690
And.

641
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,390
Because all of these things are alive, we've

642
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:06,780
already seen that mobilization in the ground

643
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:12,990
states is. Exactly one. And we can check what

644
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,810
effect that first excited the set of first excited

645
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:22,460
states will have on the overall expectation value.

646
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,750
So to get from a ground state to a first exciting

647
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:32,410
stage. The only thing we can do is flip a single

648
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:36,700
spin, so starting from either of these two states,

649
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:42,280
from the center line up or down, we negate one of

650
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:45,120
the spins we get, one that is pointing down while

651
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:47,950
the rest point out we have one that is pointing up

652
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,060
all the rest point down.

653
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,890
And the total number of microstates that have this.

654
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:03,930
This particular set of operating expenses

655
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,130
responding magnetization is just, again, the.

656
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,900
Binomial coefficient now with a single speed

657
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,790
pointing out or equivalently and minus one spins

658
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,800
pointing up at a single point. Now each of these

659
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:27,460
factors is just equal to in. Their son gives us to

660
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:33,730
an. Degenerate microstates. Where the position

661
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:38,390
normalized by the number of degrees of freedom is.

662
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:43,400
Almost one, but not quite an exact approaches, one

663
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:50,030
as the number of students increases. So. The

664
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:54,560
deviation from the maximum position in this first

665
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,580
excited state is just a one over and correction

666
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,240
that vanishes in that moment.

667
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,190
So. In order to.

668
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,480
Figure out what effect this first excited state is

669
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,500
having on the system, we need to compute the

670
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,640
probability now and it will be adopted. That, in

671
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,960
turn, depends on the first excited state energy

672
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:33,170
where. We have. Rather than minus one from every

673
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:39,900
link, we have a. Plus one coming from all the

674
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,040
nearest neighbors.

675
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,860
Of the one spin that has been flipped with respect

676
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,290
to all the rest St..

677
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:59,390
From that spin, this our. To the.

678
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:04,940
Links that have a positive contribution to the

679
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,990
energy and dimensions and then all of the other

680
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:13,690
links in the latest. It's the same minus one

681
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:18,260
factor. That's what we had before and the ground

682
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:23,720
states there are now the times and minus those to

683
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,020
the.

684
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:30,650
Linc's. With this negative one contribution to the

685
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:35,480
energy is that plus two to minus the Times and.

686
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:39,770
Minus two D lengths for a total of.

687
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:43,880
We

688
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:50,540
seems.

689
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,990
That was a testament to the scrap of this gap here.

690
00:48:57,110 --> 00:49:03,850
The total is minus and minus 14.

691
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,860
So I'll just go a couple of minutes over today to

692
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:16,130
bring everything together quickly. So looking at

693
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:22,160
the relative probability for this model to be in

694
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,030
the state with the maximum magnetization versus

695
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:29,480
the first excited state with the one over and

696
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:35,780
change. To that maximum is just a product of this

697
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,040
ability, depending on the energy and times, the

698
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,940
number of microstates with that probability. So

699
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:48,850
the probability of being in the ground state. Is

700
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:53,230
the two distinct microstates multiplied by that

701
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,980
large exponential factor and the probability of

702
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:01,120
being in that first excited state is the two and

703
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:07,900
microstates times the slightly different factor by

704
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,690
the speed of times, the energy of that versus the

705
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:14,820
states, which is these times in minus 40. So

706
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:18,160
canceling out the speed of times, an exponential

707
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,550
factor and moving the negative exponential up to

708
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:26,840
the top. We can confirm. That the crown stage is

709
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,320
exponentially more profitable for the system to be

710
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:36,830
in as the temperature data becomes a large number.

711
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:40,540
There is an exponential factor in the temperature

712
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:43,430
of the first degree on stage compared to the

713
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:46,550
linear factor and on the multiplicity of the first

714
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:51,110
excited stage. So as we go to sufficiently low

715
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:54,320
temperature, a sufficiently large beat up, we have

716
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,900
exponential domination of the ground states. And

717
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,940
as we saw before, the non interacting case only

718
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,090
exponentially suppressed contributions from the

719
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:09,020
higher energy levels. So that is to say that in

720
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:13,220
low temperatures we have. All of these bands

721
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:17,280
aligning for ordering, so this gives us the order

722
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:22,620
to phase where the magnetization approaches. Its

723
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:26,580
maximum value of one as the temperature decreases,

724
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,360
so.

725
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:33,740
20. Twelve minutes over today just to wrap up,

726
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:37,470
that's. Scan of the possible faces of the U.S.

727
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:40,320
model at zero field and high and low temperatures.

728
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:45,940
And we have contrasted these two phases by looking

729
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:50,920
at the accusation, seeing that in one phase, the

730
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,440
organization is small disorder phase and the order

731
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:57,880
patronization is large. We'll pick up on Friday by

732
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:02,800
looking at. The possible ways that we can connect

733
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:06,520
between these two phases as the temperature varies

734
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:12,970
from one minute to the next. So I will forward to

735
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:16,200
see you then back in the other room, down the hall.
