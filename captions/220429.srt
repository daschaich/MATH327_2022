1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:07,040
It is just about time to get underway, so here is

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,120
the six-digit code for today:

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,760
two six two, four seven four.

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,260
So far this week we have introduced

5
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,620
interactions and phase transitions in general,

6
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,330
looked at the Ising model on a d-dimensional simple cubic lattice

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:40,820
as the simple playground to make those discussions

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,590
more quantitative, and we've seen on Tuesday the two

9
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,730
distinct phases that pop up or emerge from the

10
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,830
Ising model at high and low temperatures. So any questions

11
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,130
about those general issues before we pick up and

12
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,500
start to look at the more interesting regime of

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,190
what happens in between those two limiting

14
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:04,880
behaviors?

15
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,900
Let's see...

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,120
To quickly recap what we have

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,860
gone over, the Ising model

18
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:33,130
itself is defined by this energy that sums over

19
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,750
pairs of nearest neighbor spins, multiply by each

20
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,330
other in addition to the usual.

21
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,450
Coupling between the STEM degrees of freedom and.

22
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,700
The external magnetic field spins have values plus

23
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:59,280
or minus one, and the nearest neighbors are. You

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,170
find. By the underlying lattice structure of.

25
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,740
Which we may take a look at some of the

26
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,440
possibilities this afternoon is the detail, no

27
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,590
particular person boundary conditions. To.

28
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:29,040
Out of the space on the page and simplify the

29
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,920
overall structure of the lattice and be considered

30
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:43,180
the zero field is the model. And the of high and

31
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,580
low temperature. So as the temperature becomes

32
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,580
high, we end up with.

33
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,600
Equal opportunities for all of the microstates,

34
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,240
just one over. The total mobilization factor to

35
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:09,080
end and with all microstates equally probable, the

36
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,430
phase is determined by. The degeneracy is the

37
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:14,940
number.

38
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,470
District microstates with a given energy

39
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,260
for a different distribution of operating expense.

40
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:37,350
And. If we characterize this by the magnetization.

41
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,630
So, William, verbalised difference, looking at the

42
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,130
absolute value of the case of zero external fuel.

43
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,880
And the total magnetization womanize by the number

44
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,320
of spins, which is the difference between upward

45
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,890
and downward when he divided by the total.

46
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,320
When the. Things is determined just by counting

47
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,770
the degeneracy of the numbers of possible

48
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,080
microstates with different distributions of

49
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,690
operating expense. We have roughly equal numbers.

50
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,320
That is where binomial coefficient is separately,

51
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,030
which was a topic of one of the first tutorials

52
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,530
that we did for the start of the term. The

53
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,530
magnetization then becomes. Approximately zero

54
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,500
approaching exactly zero in that thermodynamic

55
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,150
limit. But the number of degrees of freedom

56
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,560
becoming large.

57
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,840
The opposite limit, how low temperatures, the

58
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,750
probabilities are exponentially sensitive to.

59
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:02,470
Their energies in particular, all excited energy

60
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,590
levels are exponentially suppressed compared to

61
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,060
the ground states, just to say that the. The

62
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,340
Granite State wins.

63
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:18,730
Evy. I have seen from this energy that. The.

64
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,450
Ground state with the minimum energy occurs, the

65
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,750
absence of electrical field for all of the spin's

66
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,360
are aligned in the same direction.

67
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,910
Whether that is plus or minus, we can't tell but

68
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,240
that.

69
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,300
Produces what we call the order phase. But there

70
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,890
is a tendency for all of these things to align in

71
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,070
one direction or another with the absolute value

72
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,730
of the magnetization approaching its maximum value

73
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:58,960
of one. As the temperature gets smaller and this

74
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,740
order phase. Is in contrast to the disorder things

75
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,080
up here and maybe give some intuition beyond. Just

76
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,450
writing down words of equations, we can look at

77
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:20,690
some examples of microstates of the easy model. At

78
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,590
high and low temperatures, these are some figures

79
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:30,660
from. Schroeder's book on thermal physics, where

80
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,540
he's considering a 20 by 20 lattice in Colorado

81
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,370
squares in that light as either black or white,

82
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,670
depending on whether the skin is a plus or minus

83
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:48,750
one. And even for systems that would certainly not

84
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,860
add another page to use 20 by 20 degrees of

85
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,180
freedom do correspond to two to the four hundred

86
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,120
power possible microstates. So that's about 10 to

87
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,370
the power of one hundred twenty. So

88
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,910
few samples are coming from. A computer program

89
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,230
that samples those microstates proportional to the

90
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,470
probability distribution and at high temperatures,

91
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
we can get a visual sense that.

92
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,620
Given the roughly equal probabilities for all the

93
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,600
different microstates we are. Almost guaranteed to

94
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,170
end up, for example, from that flat distribution

95
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:41,690
with a. What the even number of operating expenses

96
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,030
when black squares in this case, so. Even

97
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,060
comparing Iran and missile states, but those four

98
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,290
hundred spins are said to be black or white here

99
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,560
with equal probability. If you have a temperature

100
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,200
of 10. In their.

101
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,210
In the. Units of.

102
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,850
Of magnetic fields, so. Get into those units a bit

103
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,730
later on, this is a relatively high temperature

104
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,460
where you can see the. If we didn't have to leave

105
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,170
this out here, we wouldn't necessarily be able to

106
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,660
tell the difference between that random mental

107
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,290
state and the. Because they draw from the top of

108
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,660
the distribution at a relatively high temperature,

109
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,620
while the situation changes as we go to the low

110
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,950
temperatures, we end up with big blocks of spins

111
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,350
all around in one direction or another,

112
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,660
corresponding to almost all sides of this lattice

113
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,920
being either white or covered in black. And then

114
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,330
the interesting question is what happens in

115
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,670
between those high, high and low temperature

116
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,960
regimes, which is what we'll focus on today and

117
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,430
probably on Tuesday as well. We can see and it is

118
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,650
more intermediate temperatures, there is a more

119
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,320
intermediate behavior there. Still a mixture of

120
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,670
black and white spin's that there are regions

121
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,340
where the spins are all stay here, the mostly

122
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,790
black, and here they're mostly white. So if we

123
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:30,330
were to zoom in on smaller sections of this twenty

124
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,100
one lattice, you might see something that looked

125
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,190
like the lower temperature case. But if we were to

126
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,280
zoom out and look at the latest as a whole, we

127
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,770
still have roughly equal numbers of operating

128
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,480
expense as we did in the high temperature phase

129
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:52,000
just to sort of this home. This is a larger system.

130
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,200
Computed in the same way.

131
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,660
Numerically sampled from the probability

132
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,020
distribution, now with four hundred by four

133
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,300
hundred sites so that there are something like ten

134
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,230
to the forty eight thousand possible microstates.

135
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:13,800
And.

136
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,830
Temperature here is set to be two point two seven,

137
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,400
which is an interesting number that we'll get back

138
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:31,460
to if we can see islands of alliances, of all

139
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,790
different scales, easier to look at the marksman's

140
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,530
visually and with this little island of mostly

141
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,260
black spins there, the larger island over there.

142
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,290
So this one water just filed over here. If we had

143
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,860
selected any of those kind of 20 by 20, Latisse

144
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,310
being looked at the previous set of figures. You

145
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,380
might have thought the system was butterface. But

146
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,920
looking at the larger scale system, we could see

147
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,450
equal numbers of upward and downward pointing

148
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,560
spins. So an overall visualization that's more

149
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,850
consistent with this phase. So, two. Briefly

150
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,480
policy, if there are any further questions about

151
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,050
those visas before we dive into. Putting this sort

152
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:23,740
of visual.

153
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,470
Consideration, home work, mathematical footing.

154
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,920
We zoom back in here, the key concept that. Makes

155
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,540
the.

156
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,730
Discussion of these high temperature cases, very

157
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:53,900
mathematically well-defined, is the concept of the

158
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,890
order parameter, which in the case of the easy

159
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,800
model is the magnetization we've been discussing.

160
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:07,370
This is a quantity that is small in one phase,

161
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,710
what we've identified as the disordered phase with

162
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,280
reference to the sorts of visualizations of the

163
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,790
user model, and it becomes it goes to zero and

164
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,390
that sort of limits. But there's a number of

165
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,330
degrees of freedom. But the other ordered phase or

166
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:30,350
the parameter is not zero and in particular large

167
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,660
enough to be easily distinguished from zero.

168
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,650
The lawsuit over some of the forward construction

169
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,660
of the theory of these transitions, which could be

170
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,520
a model in itself, but there is a distinction

171
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,860
between the true order parameter and just any

172
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,300
given quantity. We want to define that by behave

173
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,850
differently in these two phases. And that

174
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,290
distinction is that the order parameter formally

175
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,910
is related to some derivative of the free energy.

176
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,450
So in addition to finishing in one phase and the

177
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,090
other, it's got to be a different order parameter,

178
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,690
it has to be related to a derivative of the of the

179
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,470
free energy use of water, of the partition

180
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,450
function and. Just to give a so we've always

181
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,790
assumed this to be the case for now. It is

182
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,460
possible to have what are called topological phase

183
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:44,730
transitions that have a actual transition between

184
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,640
two different phases but do not have an altered

185
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,480
parameter characterizing them. And these are. Not

186
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,930
only interesting, but important as well, so I

187
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,520
mentioned in passing here that the most famous

188
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,870
example of a technological transition without

189
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,530
water is known as the transition. Discovery

190
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,090
independently by Brzezinski is to be impossible to

191
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:19,010
tell us the K.A., which was a recently recognized

192
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,700
Nobel Prize in physics five years ago. Now, we can

193
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,860
also generalize this concept of water parameters

194
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,470
you think of. Specific systems that have multiple

195
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,590
distinct transitions, each with multiple distinct

196
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,100
order parameters related to different derivatives

197
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,660
of that free energy. But for the time being, just.

198
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,150
Keep working with the. Using ball with the

199
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:50,490
magnetization is that over the perimeter, you will

200
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,790
see its relationship to free energy in just a few

201
00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:00,680
minutes. And with the border parameter in hand,

202
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:07,160
distinguished. The disordered phase there is zero.

203
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,340
And the order phase would is not necessarily its

204
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,980
maximum value, but anything distinct from zero. We

205
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:21,780
can formally define the phase transition and

206
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,890
distinguish it from a smooth and gradual crossover

207
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,270
between two distinct phases, which is the.

208
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,130
The question of the drive to what is a phase

209
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,000
transition mathematically, so mathematically we

210
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,870
only have a phase transition when the order

211
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:48,690
parameter itself is discontinuous or diversions or

212
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,080
one of its derivatives with respect to the control

213
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,740
parameters of the system, exhibit such a

214
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:00,100
discontinuity or divergence, which typically will

215
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,380
only appear in that thermodynamic limit of an

216
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,430
infinite number of degrees of freedom. So we say

217
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,910
that the we express the order parameter as a

218
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:17,050
function of the control parameters. And see if it

219
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,070
or any of its derivatives with respect to those

220
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,730
parameters have. Discontinuous behavior included

221
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,740
divergences, and if they do the value of the

222
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,290
control parameter. Corresponding to that

223
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,870
divergence, which is commendably is known as the

224
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,750
critical point of that phase transition. So that

225
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,970
is the general definition that we can quickly

226
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,870
specialize to the easy model itself, where having

227
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,680
turned off the external fuel to the suction, the

228
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,610
temperature is the only remaining program that we

229
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,340
have to to very well fix the structure with a

230
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,640
fixed number of degrees of freedom. So that

231
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,130
critical point. Becomes a critical temperature,

232
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,360
T.S.. Where?

233
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,900
If we do have a phase transition, there are these

234
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,480
two possibilities to consider the border itself is

235
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,980
discontinuous in this case or the border parameter

236
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,060
is continuous, but one of its derivatives with

237
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:38,070
respect to the temperature, is discontinuous with

238
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:43,010
versions. So these two cases or. Coming out of

239
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,880
some obscure process of historical understanding

240
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:51,980
are known as the first and second order phase

241
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,710
transitions, respectively, so the first order

242
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,700
phase transition. There is a. The street jump in

243
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,780
the water perimeter itself, so the magnetization

244
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,270
in the case of the easy go.

245
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,170
There is a second order phase transition, that

246
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:19,490
order parameter is continuous at the critical time,

247
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,530
really continuous for all temperatures. But it's

248
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:28,240
derivative as a discontinuity, which we can see

249
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,260
from this schematic picture here, if we were to

250
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,030
approach that critical temperature from. Lower

251
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,300
temperatures, the left hand side, and we see that

252
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,540
the derivative of this line has a very large

253
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,170
negative slope becoming larger and larger as we

254
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:52,030
approach to see. That corresponds to probably try

255
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,690
to draw that to the side.

256
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,150
Derivative with respect to temperature of that

257
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,990
order parameter.

258
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,620
That.

259
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,450
I said it was negative slope, so I just.

260
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:22,810
And those actions down to negative values. We're

261
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:29,990
coming from the left, the eventually subversions

262
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,750
option A. Infinitely negative value is coming from

263
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,830
the right with the. Value of the A parameter is

264
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:43,740
always zero. The slope itself is. Derivative of

265
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,760
zero, which is zero, and that gives us, in this

266
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,410
case, the discontinuity. In the first derivative

267
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,470
of the order or so, it is still able to transition,

268
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:03,530
but with that. Discontinuity in the derivative

269
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:07,370
rather than the order itself becomes known as the

270
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,700
second order phase transition. So historically,

271
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,830
there were also discussions of third or fourth

272
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,320
order phase transitions where depending on how

273
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,960
many derivatives you had to take to see this

274
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,140
discontinuity, that would be the order of the

275
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,250
phase transition. That's an antiquated terminology

276
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,420
these days and.

277
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:34,690
Modern parlance, anything that features a

278
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,800
continuous order parameter, but a discontinuity at

279
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,320
some finite number of derivatives is just that

280
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:46,270
second order phase transition. So whenever the

281
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,220
order perimeter is continuous, is the second row

282
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:49,840
the case?

283
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:59,270
And as the. One final comment on the. General

284
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,150
aspects of his transition before looking in more

285
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:06,800
detail at this model mentioned above in this

286
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,680
definition, the role of that through the equipment

287
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,310
which is typically required in order to see actual

288
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:18,590
discontinuities. So what happens? In general, we

289
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,520
have a system with a finite number of computers,

290
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:28,290
that freedom that's. Instead of the actual

291
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:34,200
discontinuity showing up in court versus control

292
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:42,300
parameter as in increases, is the sort of smooth

293
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,100
behavior that.

294
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,230
More and more rapidly, Gary.

295
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,220
So this is.

296
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,280
It's more the smaller the end is, the smaller this

297
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,170
is its.

298
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,460
It becomes a more rapid transition. And it's only

299
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,440
in the limits of infinite and that there is

300
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:21,700
additional discontinuity emerging, so.

301
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,290
Our formal definition is sometimes some of the

302
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:35,030
textbooks, you'll see that they will say true

303
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:39,320
phase transitions only occur when there are an

304
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,190
infinite number of degrees of freedom. But really,

305
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:48,230
we can tell based on how the independence of the

306
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,840
entrepreneur on the temperature varies as the

307
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,960
system size increases, whether that discontinuity

308
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,800
is developing or equivalently, that divergence in

309
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,470
its first derivative. So these techniques are.

310
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,640
They will find out how the system varies as its

311
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,820
numbers of degrees of freedom, change and.

312
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,160
I think we will get into that and this morning,

313
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,680
you have enough other topics to. To go over in the

314
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,470
time remaining is the way to distinguish whether

315
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,560
or not a change between faces is a true transition,

316
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,330
even when these systems are finite, as of course,

317
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:42,750
everything physical is. So that is.

318
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,330
Abstract or generic? Definition of phase

319
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,640
transitions of first and second order. And

320
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,420
assuming there are questions about that, we can

321
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,600
make things a bit more solid by

322
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,660
looking in more detail at the U.S. model. As it.

323
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,130
Transitions between its high temperature

324
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,100
disordered phase and that low temperature order

325
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,640
things, so this might allow some of those abstract

326
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,280
discussions to be made more concrete. But, of

327
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,160
course, mentioned earlier that the easy model is

328
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,180
only soluble analytically in one or two dimensions.

329
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:34,100
The end still a net zero for your case, and in

330
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,980
particular, if you want to restore an external

331
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,850
magnetic field, the solution is only known in the

332
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,430
one dimensional case. So. If you want to say

333
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:44,940
anything

334
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,920
mathematical about this. There are sort of only

335
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,610
two options available to us. One is numerical

336
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,950
simulation of the sort you did on that computer

337
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:02,750
project, which is relegated to Unit 10 or have

338
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,620
some general discussion of that. What we're

339
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,460
focused on here is a way to get an approximation

340
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:17,000
to the using model. That will allow us to look at

341
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,690
the transition region. Hopefully in a reliable way.

342
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,100
Even in the presence of a non-zero external field

343
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,510
where the resolution no longer needs an average

344
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:38,560
value. So to start the process towards. This

345
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,240
result, we can. Look at a bit more detail about

346
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:49,070
the deposition. With a non-zero external fuel. And

347
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:53,750
in particular, we can see that from its definition

348
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,710
is the difference between the number of operating

349
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,960
expenses and the brutality and expense, it is

350
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,170
probably related to the sum over the spin's

351
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:08,030
themselves. We look at this sum that whenever we

352
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,850
have a positive spin, it contributes a plus one.

353
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,010
Whenever we have a negative spin to contribute to

354
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,540
minus one, which

355
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,000
overall estimates just gives us the total number

356
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,060
of operating expenses, minus the total number of

357
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,510
dollars on expense, kind of one minus one for each

358
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,400
of the corresponding degrees of freedom.

359
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,590
And of course, this is useful because we've seen

360
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,420
exactly the similar spins before, it showed up in

361
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,480
the using model energy in the first place, which

362
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,680
means that we can rewrite. The internal energy for

363
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:54,700
getting microstates I in terms of this

364
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:02,370
magnetization, so. And is the average value of all

365
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,770
these things in the given microstates? So multiply

366
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,520
three by and relates that sum itself to end times

367
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,190
magnetization for a total magnetization. The

368
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,610
Capital M. That varies with the number of spins of

369
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:24,350
the system, so plugging this internal energy in to

370
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:30,060
the economic competition function. Some of you to

371
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:34,230
the minus made the Times internal energy, the

372
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,720
negative sides cancel out, we can overall factor

373
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,680
hold the temperature better on both terms. And we

374
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,430
have an expression for the partition function that

375
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,140
explicitly depends on the translation of each

376
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,740
microstates defined by the spin configuration.

377
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,560
So this is the promised connection between that

378
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:04,720
magnetization and free energy see organization

379
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,570
appearing in the partition function.

380
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:15,390
And the free energy itself is just the logarithm

381
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,450
of that production function with a factor of minus

382
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:23,510
two fronts that we can. Plug into a derivative

383
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:26,960
with respect to the external feel. With an eye

384
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,630
towards getting something that depends on the

385
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,550
magnetization, so.

386
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:38,430
Proceeding with the definition of that free energy.

387
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:47,350
The derivative of the log. This one over Z, that's

388
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:52,740
the derivative of Z with respect to H and moving

389
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,550
that derivative through the sun over microstates.

390
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,790
The derivative of the exponential is simple enough

391
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:06,700
to do in our heads. We end up with some overall.

392
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:14,540
Microstates of from Chambal Bita. Times,

393
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,340
mobilization and times that same exponential

394
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,920
factor was derivative we have just taken.

395
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,350
So the inverse temperature data and the

396
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:40,600
temperature cancel and. Looking at the inverse

397
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,280
protection function multiplied by the sum of

398
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,730
Raulston configurations of the mechanization of

399
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,860
the corresponding spined configuration.

400
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,230
We can identify that as just the expectation value

401
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,500
of the total magnetization with a negative side

402
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:06,110
for a criminal, 18 times the expectation value of

403
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,020
the normalized micronization that ranges from

404
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:15,010
minus one to one. So rearranging some of these

405
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,210
intermediate steps, that gives us an expression

406
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,270
for that expectation, value of the magnetization

407
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:27,350
or order parameter it is. Minus to you, sorry,

408
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,670
plus to your friend. So the minus signs cancel out

409
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:38,990
those equality's. And define convert that. Tea to

410
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:39,650
one of the.

411
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:45,590
And normalization factor or whatever in the times,

412
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:45,920
the.

413
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,150
Derivative with respect to external fuel of the

414
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,310
logarithm of the protection function. So this is

415
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:59,420
the promised connection between magnetization and

416
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,670
the free energy that confirms it is a formal order

417
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,270
parameter.

418
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,130
Is that quantity is rigorously defined?

419
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:21,500
Now, if we go back to this relationship between

420
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,580
the position for a given spin configuration and

421
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,850
the average value of the some number that

422
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,730
configuration. You can push the.

423
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:39,920
Would apply the expectation value to both sides of

424
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:46,080
that relation. And then relate the order itself to

425
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:50,400
the expectation value of the average spin, or to

426
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,640
say the other way, the average of the expectations,

427
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,470
values of all the spins as we sum over all of the.

428
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,940
Spin configurations, so the expectation value is

429
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,970
given by that sum of all possible spin

430
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,360
configurations, meaning that this quantity is

431
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,960
independent of any particular configuration. It is

432
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,100
simply a function of our two control parameters.

433
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:25,900
So. But on the next page, that's Paul.

434
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:35,160
The average spin is a function of the inverse

435
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,910
temperature data, and that means that appeals to

436
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:42,940
an age independent of. The spin configuration

437
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,570
itself. And there's a trick that we can play

438
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,940
around with looking at the spin spin interaction

439
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,360
in the internal energy of the user model. We can't

440
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,270
exactly rewrite this by adding and subtracting

441
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,400
that average magnetization from both of these

442
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:09,330
factors, so SCBA minus M plus M is just as

443
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:14,280
subjective. And if we organize this as the

444
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:20,760
fluctuations sometimes called Beltagy, how the

445
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:25,500
speed S.J fluctuates around the average value of

446
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,010
the spin.

447
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:31,260
Then we can expand this product into.

448
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:37,720
Four terms, so the fluctuations square S.J in this

449
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,780
case correspond to nearest neighbor sites defined

450
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,350
by the structure and the cross terms, the

451
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,740
individual spins multiplied by this constant

452
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,770
magnetization in duration and on the temperature

453
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,750
of magnetic field, minus that overall constants

454
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,580
and the squared.

455
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,070
So what we've done in this equation, 114, is

456
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:06,910
actually take a simple product of two things, make

457
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,240
it a lot more complicated by. We'll leave it up to

458
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,750
fluctuations around the absolute.

459
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:20,170
By subtracting that absolute squared, the. Purpose

460
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,160
for the benefit that we gain from doing this. Is.

461
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:30,270
By conjecturing. That these fluctuations on

462
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:35,670
average are small, we can make an approximation

463
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,810
that this term of two small factors multiplied by

464
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,120
each other can be reflected.

465
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:50,210
Leaving only the.

466
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,200
Remaining terms in this expansion. I should note

467
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,950
that this is somewhat non-trivial approximation

468
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,490
because

469
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,960
obviously these are the two values of that you can

470
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,640
take plus or minus one cannot be cannot both be

471
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,860
close to the average magnetization. So before you

472
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,970
put the flip one of these spins. We see a big

473
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:22,970
shift in that individual fluctuation, but if we

474
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,640
suppose on average, that's. All of those big

475
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,400
individual fluctuations around the mechanisation

476
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,890
cancel out, which. We know that the climate they

477
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:39,760
have to give us that position as the average, we

478
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,230
can justify this approximation, which then

479
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:49,090
replaces that. Spin, spin, interaction term in the

480
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,960
easing, the internal energy to what is called what

481
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,290
is known as the field approximation. They're only.

482
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,380
Terms linear in the individual spins remain in the

483
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,450
song over here to stay with us.

484
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:14,530
And this summer, Brewer's neighbors that simplify

485
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,770
that second term is just a constant for every one

486
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:21,970
of the nearest neighbors that we have computed

487
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,030
earlier this week that there are these times and

488
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:30,180
possible terms. In the sun for a p dimensional

489
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,880
symbol for ubiquitous, so that constant factor

490
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,490
just comes out front end times and Times Square

491
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,610
with the overall negative side pences, with the

492
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:47,340
relative negative side. And then in the other term,

493
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:53,880
we have the two spins on either side of the link

494
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,750
defining or the link connecting these nearest

495
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,290
neighbors.

496
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:03,360
Which means that if we sum over the overall

497
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,690
population, the largest, the entire large volume,

498
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:11,810
every single spin is going to appear twice, once

499
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:16,940
from one, says S.J onces effectively.

500
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,320
There are then.

501
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:34,020
Yeah, to the. Copies of each individual has been

502
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,410
submitted in some of her legs,

503
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,930
recall maybe be a bit more detail in this written

504
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:46,500
down here, thinking of how many times it's been a

505
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,270
little counted as we go over some of the links in

506
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,250
however many dimensions that we have, we've

507
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:58,410
counted that there are two deep links connected to

508
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,510
each of these spans. All of which are included in

509
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,340
this song, so.

510
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,720
We can rewrite. This some of your neighbors

511
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,000
assisted some over the themselves with that cost a

512
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,740
factor of two and the cost factor coming along

513
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,330
from our expansion in terms of fluctuations. So

514
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:30,990
combining that some over. Dispense with the some,

515
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:36,050
you already have connectivity, make them feel this

516
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,650
equation one 15 results where we just have a sum

517
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:46,320
over the spin's times that two times zation plus

518
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,710
the external magnetic field, which we can write in

519
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:55,590
a. More evocative way by defining effective

520
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:01,800
magnetic field that depends both on the control

521
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,610
parameter itself to be. Magnetic field we started

522
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:09,630
off with, as well as the mean value of the spin

523
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:14,280
multiplied by the number of links connected to

524
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:20,980
each site in the sun. So this is sort of the

525
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,980
historical origin of the name of this

526
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,130
approximation, we have introduced an effective

527
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:33,280
feel that you spin that sees that depends on the

528
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,880
value of the spin given by the magnetization. So

529
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:43,230
this result is. Goes by the name of the main field

530
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,520
approximation, which otherwise is a bit mysterious

531
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,710
while neglecting these fluctuations. Gives us this

532
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:58,110
effective feel, depending on the spin and in

533
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:05,920
essence, we are supposing that we can average over

534
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,120
all of the nearest neighbors that you seize to

535
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:16,080
produce. And approximately Konsta factor that we

536
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,890
can account for just as a modification of that

537
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,770
magnetic field, which is sort of the conceptual

538
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:27,540
aspect of this, that cycle, back to on Tuesday,

539
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,130
when we wrap up the discussion of the windfield

540
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:38,730
approximation itself will get a bit further today,

541
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,600
stirred by. Considering what happens from the.

542
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:47,240
Take this new expression for the energy in the

543
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,200
mutual approximation and put it through our

544
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:55,260
criterion for identifying an interactive system.

545
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,330
I remind you is.

546
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:06,010
Looking at what happens to energy when. An

547
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:11,350
arbitrary degree of freedom is changed. In this

548
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:16,160
case, it is. A single spin where the only thing we

549
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,880
can do to get to. Change it is the game, its value.

550
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:26,340
So when we flip that single spin, this first term

551
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,940
is a constant until the independence of the

552
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:36,900
Confederation and the dependence on the external

553
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,300
on the effective magnetic field, that we just pick

554
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,280
up a negative sign for the spin of the other state,

555
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,890
the same and not too surprisingly, the

556
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:53,170
corresponding change in the energy. Is just twice

557
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:56,940
that effective magnetic field times has been

558
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,080
installed as this is.

559
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:05,430
Independence of all of the other degrees of

560
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:05,880
freedom.

561
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:15,300
We have taken our using model, the paradigm of an

562
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,610
interacting system and

563
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:24,690
reduced it to, you know, interacting approximation,

564
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,170
but still accounts for some of these nearest

565
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:32,280
neighbor interactions through this definition of

566
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,670
the effective magnetic field arising from

567
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,770
expanding precisely those nearest neighbor

568
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:38,580
interactions.

569
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,230
So let's see. When the time goes.

570
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:55,450
We have enough time to. Push forward the analysis

571
00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:00,510
of this new fuel approximation to. And we set up

572
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:05,640
the identification of a phase transition in

573
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:10,280
Mischaracterisation, which. Is now much simpler

574
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,090
than in the case, the the is involved because as a

575
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,370
not interacting system through our formal

576
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,910
definition, we can expect the petition function

577
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:23,300
and other observables to factories to boil down

578
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,830
into just a product of that single particle

579
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:32,340
partition function. Just as happened for the full

580
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:40,450
on the case back in three. So. Plugging in that

581
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:44,550
mean fuel energy. Into the corresponding

582
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,900
protection function.

583
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:53,980
Try to put both views on the projector at the same

584
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:59,500
time. We have this overall concept turn up front,

585
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,160
that's as it does not depend on any of the spin

586
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,960
configurations. We can just pull out. The

587
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,210
multiplicative factor of the exponential of minus

588
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,020
the times this constant in these times, in times,

589
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:18,660
standardization squared and the dimensions, and

590
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:23,040
then all the same configurations are defined by.

591
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,410
The plus minus one values for each of those things

592
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:34,800
where the remaining split independent piece. Of

593
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:40,430
this exponential factor. It was just given by the

594
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,590
some overspenders with some prefecture just

595
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,270
justified to be this X minus B the times, the

596
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:53,670
effective magnetic field, which was put back many

597
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,240
weeks ago to another track, expenses to the

598
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:02,210
equation. Forty one we had exactly this for. Of

599
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:05,520
the protection function. Aware that some of our

600
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,120
spins inside the exponential can be broken up into

601
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,500
the product of the exponential of the spin with

602
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,310
the spin taking two values plus or minus one, we

603
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:22,860
have the exponential of X plus the exponential or

604
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,580
minus X known to his friends as a hyperbolic

605
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:30,470
cosine for each of those and spins independently

606
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:35,190
the factories calculation that just raises. That's

607
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:40,690
hyperbolic, cosine. To the nth power that we can

608
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,430
insert the defective magnetic field to get the

609
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:50,770
full equation one 16 or the beam partition

610
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:55,510
function, a constant exponential factor times a.

611
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,170
And powers are being hyperbolic, cosine that

612
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:04,490
depend on the mechanization. So this is far

613
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:08,470
simpler than the easy model where in a general

614
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,320
number of dimensions, there is no known analytic

615
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:17,450
solution. But it is interesting that. The

616
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:22,130
partition function depends explicitly on the order

617
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:24,800
parameter, the expectation value of this

618
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,810
magnetization, which we have recently seen, is

619
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:36,420
itself. Related to the derivative of that petition

620
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,680
function. So if we look at the derivative we

621
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,180
derived in general terms earlier. The

622
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,490
mechanization is one over 10 times better times

623
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:50,250
the derivative of the larger the production

624
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,010
function with respect to the magnetic field.

625
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:59,910
All of this factor depends on age and only one way

626
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:04,560
that's inside the hyperbolic cosine. So the longer

627
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,700
the power brings the power in, down, out front, we

628
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,090
have the logarithm of the hyperbolic cosine of the

629
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,670
defective magnetic field, plus a bunch of other

630
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:17,430
terms that are independent of each drop out of

631
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:21,750
that derivative. So taking the derivative of that

632
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:26,250
long term, what's the hyperbolic cosine of the

633
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,250
denominator and then the chain rule it through to

634
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:33,820
get a hyperbolic sign in the numerator with a

635
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,510
again, another application of the chain rule,

636
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:41,520
taking a base out front, cancel out the one over

637
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,090
data that we started off with. So since you

638
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:51,940
because if they a and we have an expression that

639
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:58,810
has the. Order parameter the. Expectation, value

640
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:00,790
of the organization on both the left and right

641
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:05,690
hand sides. We found that that magnetization is

642
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:10,130
equal to the township itself with some dependence

643
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:12,920
on the increased temperature they're going to feel

644
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:19,250
and dimensionality of the system. So. The

645
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:22,430
Minnifield approximation is only self-consistent

646
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,120
when this equation 117 is satisfied, look,

647
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,170
considering that order parameter as the.

648
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:36,610
The variable, the degree of freedom to to analyze,

649
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:40,240
so that is where we will pick up next Tuesday,

650
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:43,210
university will be closed on Monday for the bank

651
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:47,140
holiday. We will look at the solutions of the

652
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:50,290
self-consistent supervision equivalent to finding

653
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:56,710
the roots of the hyperbolic geometric equation,

654
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:02,230
leading the charge of X to X itself. And we will

655
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:07,930
see what those self-consistent solutions have to

656
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:12,220
say about the phases of the mutual approximation,

657
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,860
depending on the temperature dimensionality. So

658
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,410
are there any questions before we break for the

659
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:24,660
morning? So we'll pick up with that on Tuesday,

660
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:29,040
this afternoon with that, some of homework

661
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:30,300
solutions and

662
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,860
some the things that we can do with. Let us know

663
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:35,880
what, General.
