1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,630
OK, that should be the recording underway, so we can

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,550
get going. There's a few people connected by

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,690
Zoom in addition to the smaller crowd today.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,670
Imagine I saw some of you were up a bit late last

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,860
night working on the computer project, which is

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,250
now through.  The next homework assignment due in a

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,390
couple more weeks, should be available on the

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,820
weekend, finishing touches on that. And, of course,

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,050
there's a forecast for unpleasant weather later

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:41,840
today. Well, it's sunny and calm at the moment.

11
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,690
That's how weather forecasts go, but set that

12
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,140
aside, get underway with CNN attendance monitoring.

13
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,500
Members of the. Three, two.

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,580
We.

15
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:11,970
And then they'll resume with the set up of the

16
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,660
canonical ensemble. So it's been a few days with a

17
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,800
computer project in between. Let's do a quick

18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,600
recap of what we did earlier this week. So.

19
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,630
There is the visible.

20
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,000
After.

21
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:46,460
Ramped up the micro ensemble on Monday and moved

22
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,090
into.

23
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,870
Somewhat more natural and more tractable

24
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,570
economical ensemble.

25
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,450
So far, just developing some of the. Formalism and.

26
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,790
Defining characteristics for this self where you

27
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,050
bring in you have to see some of this sort of

28
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,920
demonic about the reminder of the differences

29
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,260
between microeconomic or ensemble's. We're in the

30
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,040
microbiological case, we directly impose the

31
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,940
conservation.

32
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,010
Of energy. What's called the first law of

33
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,590
thermodynamics, which requires that the systems we

34
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,520
consider be completely isolated from the rest of

35
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,100
the universe. You're showing some insulation

36
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,130
around a closed container filled with some

37
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,340
particles that have some some number of particles

38
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,630
and the total energy, both of which are conserved.

39
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,450
And in the canonical case, we. Remove the.

40
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,350
Condition that the system be completely isolated

41
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,900
from the rest of the universe and instead of

42
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,380
directly imposing conservation of energy.

43
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,120
We allow the system to exchange energy with its

44
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,160
surroundings and.

45
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,420
Demand that those surroundings.

46
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,040
Chokepoints visible despite being zoomed out of

47
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,680
the surroundings, fix a constant touch in addition

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,870
to the possible.

49
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,430
Now, this is much closer to the sorts of everyday

50
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,100
situations that you would want to work with and

51
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,270
also turns out to be more natural and convenient

52
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,130
for analysis just is the reason why we didn't do

53
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,020
so many examples or analysis with microeconomic.

54
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,090
All of us looking at spin systems and seeing that

55
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,150
the. Temperature can be can behave naturally, but

56
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,760
can also exhibit some strange behavior like

57
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,820
singularities and negative values. So in the

58
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,730
canonical case, once we finish building up this

59
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,250
groundwork, we will see how we can.

60
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,380
Fix the temperature on. Rather than the energy.

61
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:32,050
And fixing the temperature. But also demanding the

62
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,150
first lawsuit and the cancellation of the total

63
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,340
energy of the universe.

64
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,650
Requires this system being verbal contact with a

65
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,750
large. External thermal reservoir.

66
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,750
Which has this characteristic temperature that the

67
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,360
system picks up by virtue of this double contact.

68
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,090
Now, what we want is not to have to worry about

69
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,170
what that thermal reservoir is or maybe just see

70
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,260
that it's there is playing the role of fixing the

71
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,990
temperature and we don't care about it beyond that.

72
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,930
And the way we are, I guess, in the process of

73
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,880
managing that is what's known as the replica trick

74
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:22,910
introduced by Gears

75
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,270
in the skills and contacts for the form of that

76
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,230
thermal reservoir

77
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,320
that we want to show will be.

78
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,090
We'll drop out of all of the defendants and all

79
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,920
the characteristics of the system that we are

80
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,720
interested in.

81
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,230
The focus here a bit better.

82
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,940
So having imposed this on Zazi, we want to. Turn

83
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,860
the crank on, derive the properties of the system,

84
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,400
which if they're independent of the reservoir and

85
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,090
the way that we are proceeding with that is

86
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,030
imposing thermal equilibrium.

87
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,040
By maximizing. The Entropia.

88
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,960
Subject to constraints on that conservative total

89
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,070
energy, which.

90
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,500
It's time to come back to the actual building in

91
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,750
which that process was underway, and maybe I

92
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,220
should highlight here before just to emphasize the

93
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,520
importance of one of the things that popped out of

94
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,740
that interview maximization was the appearance of

95
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,870
the canonical petition function.

96
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,360
Which is the sum over all microstates of an

97
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,390
exponential factor of times, what is now at the

98
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:10,040
gross multiplier multiplied the energy of that

99
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,580
microstates exponentially, the negative side. What

100
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,070
we have here, which is going to turn out to be.

101
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:25,200
The fundamental starting point for analysis and

102
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,410
the canonical ensemble, so that gets us back to

103
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,480
more or less would be more and more questions

104
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,540
about the current state of things. What we did

105
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,380
earlier this week.

106
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,990
That's coming in terms either so.

107
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,880
We didn't quite have time to get through the.

108
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,060
Conclusion to this calculation on one day,

109
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,570
remember that on Tuesday when we last met, we were

110
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,490
aiming for an expression for the temperature of

111
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:09,230
the overall. Universe, the system of combined with

112
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,370
the thought of, is in contact with in order to get

113
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,460
that temperature in the microeconomic approach

114
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,920
that describes the overall universe with conserve

115
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,940
energy, we need to take the derivative of the

116
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,090
entropy with respect to the considerable energy.

117
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,160
And that energy comes from counting the total

118
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,590
number of microstates, maximizing it for thermal

119
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,720
equilibrium. Which is.

120
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,200
The condition that we have imposed miscalculation

121
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,830
and we got to the point of computing the

122
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,380
expression for the entropy in terms of the

123
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,420
logarithm of the partition function, plus this

124
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,880
other parameter, bita times that total energy of

125
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,430
ours, the number of replicas that we have in the

126
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,270
system plus several reservoir. So this is the

127
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,720
quantity that we want to take the derivative with

128
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,220
respect to that whole entity that we argued last

129
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,680
time that we have to include in this the

130
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,220
derivative of these. Parameters that have been

131
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,690
introduced into the modified entropy to capture

132
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,610
constraints on the probabilities so that data and

133
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,370
the prediction function. We are now viewing as

134
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,800
functions of this total energy, so when we take

135
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,970
the derivative of this expression, some of the

136
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,900
terms are easy. The. Total eight times better.

137
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,530
Just gives us a better front, but then we have to

138
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,740
use the product rule and worry about the energy

139
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,010
derivative of that parameter data, as well as the

140
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,280
energy derivative of the logarithm of the

141
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,010
parameters. And that, in turn, depends on better

142
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,480
sort of tracking through the chamber rule.

143
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,920
Derivative of the log is one of its arguments over

144
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,390
his head with the customer up front. And then we

145
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,940
take the derivative of the argument of the law

146
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,590
with respect to the parameter. It depends on the

147
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:18,110
user data and to get the overall energy out of our

148
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,990
pulling through. We have a debate on DFT energy,

149
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:28,900
which is the major problem that we've defined. So

150
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,800
one of the final steps in this calculation is

151
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,670
figuring out this one derivative of Z with respect

152
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,580
to detail, which is straightforward enough to

153
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,050
compute plugging in. The expression for the

154
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,380
British function we have from Tuesday just is no

155
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,340
microstates of the exponential minus speed of

156
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,220
times energy derivative with respect to better

157
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,640
than closedown, a negative energy for each micro

158
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,090
state we can recognize.

159
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:09,800
From also earlier in this page, the. Whatever is

160
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,290
that factor times the exponential speed of times

161
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,100
energy. So what is appearing in this interview?

162
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:26,650
The expression. Is. Despite the probability the

163
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,380
occupation. I believe I should say that this

164
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,740
particular crusade is realized by one of the

165
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,410
replicas in this overall system.

166
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,890
So plugging that in then gives us a sum over all

167
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,680
microstates of the occupation, probability of

168
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,810
times, the corresponding energy, which again from

169
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,320
earlier work, we can relate to the total energy

170
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,240
divided by the number of Republicans. So it's like

171
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,340
this result into where it appears in our

172
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,580
expressions for the average temperature for the

173
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,440
Hubble. It's actually become much simpler than

174
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,650
they might have looked up till now, whatever

175
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:20,560
temperature is just below. And now we have reached

176
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:26,830
the goal of this whole analysis. We have

177
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,450
expressions for all of the parameters that appear

178
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:36,490
in the probabilities for our system of interest

179
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,980
with no reference to any details of the thermal

180
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,680
reservoir. There are no more factors of our than

181
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,680
of Republicans. There are no more extensive

182
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,260
quantities that add up among all those Republicans,

183
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,060
like the overall energy or part of the number of

184
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:02,190
Republicans. What we have is. Just expressions for.

185
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,810
The temperature in terms of the parameters that

186
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,810
appear defining thermal equilibrium by maximizing

187
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,770
the entropy that up in the petition functions in,

188
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,430
so plugging in its relation that the beta

189
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,950
parameter is the inverse of the temperature, we

190
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:26,050
can rewrite that particular function as some of

191
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,990
the microstates of the exponential. Of minus the

192
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,170
energy divided by the fixed temperature.

193
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:43,000
That is. The only remaining input from the last

194
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,820
album Reservoir we're in contact with. And

195
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:52,340
similarly, the probabilities are also just that

196
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,550
same exponential factor mobilized by the

197
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,670
partnership function itself.

198
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,870
With this calculation done, all all the features

199
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,540
of the thermal reservoir having dropped out, we

200
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,980
can see that we're talking about our system of

201
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,300
interest, that omegle with microstates and with

202
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,600
corresponding probabilities, with no reference to

203
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,890
any details of the thermal sample. There's a

204
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,450
reservoir that is fixing the temperature and

205
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,630
beyond fixing the temperature. No, I have no

206
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,570
information about that thermal reservoir is even

207
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,770
knowable in the canonical approach. I just have

208
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,420
this particular probability distribution, which is

209
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,320
known depending on which side of the Atlantic I

210
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,780
happen to be on is either bowsman or Gibs

211
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,920
distribution. And the factor of the exponential of

212
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,360
the negative energy caused by temperature itself

213
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,430
is always known as the bottom factor. So it

214
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:09,730
becomes exponentially suppressed as the energies

215
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,840
become very large compared to the temperature. And

216
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,050
we can also see that. There is a connection that

217
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,310
can be made to microeconomic ensemble here that if

218
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,460
we were to fix the energies of all these

219
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,610
microstates, the way that we had to propose in the

220
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,880
microeconomic ensemble with an isolated system of

221
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,850
being conservation of energy, then all these

222
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,480
probabilities with the equal energy would result

223
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,830
in equal probability, just as we saw for

224
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,410
throughout the microeconomic context. So here we

225
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,450
are able to generalize this to let the energy vary

226
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,830
from state to state with a fixed temperature. So

227
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,820
that is the bubble development of the

228
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:04,250
microeconomic ensemble. With the petition function

229
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,740
and probabilities being the key. Characterising

230
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,760
factors that we can now apply to derive other

231
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,440
observables in terms of Sulpice here and see if

232
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,990
that whole somewhat extended argument we went

233
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,500
through introducing the replicator to the thermal

234
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,520
reservoir and then showing that it can be ignored.

235
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,280
Any questions about that or your objections to.

236
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,670
That overall approach.

237
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,790
So we have a bit a bit less where we're going

238
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,620
forward, especially next week when we start to

239
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,000
look at concrete realisations of systems covered

240
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,030
by the economic of what we've actually yet to

241
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:04,460
begin that later today. But the first step is to

242
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,960
build up things in full generality is driving some

243
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:14,610
of the. Interesting observables of measurable

244
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,540
quantities in terms of the fixed particle number

245
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,360
and fixed temperature of the canonical approach,

246
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,580
starting there with the internal energy of our

247
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:30,930
system, which is sort of turning around the micro

248
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,680
canonical rotation we went through about this time

249
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,730
last week where we fixed the energy and saw that

250
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,010
the temperature was derived as.

251
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,850
A prediction of the macroeconomic approach in the

252
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,030
classical ensemble, will we have the temperature

253
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,750
fixed, predicting the energy is going to be an

254
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,080
outcome rather than an input. And as we're saying,

255
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,860
with the thermal contact to the thermal reservoir,

256
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,810
the energy of the system is able to fluctuate, to

257
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,960
vary from microstates, microstates. So in order to

258
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,370
talk about anything stable and predictable in

259
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,920
thermodynamic equilibrium, we have to consider the

260
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,700
expectation value of the energy. For which we

261
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,860
apply the basic definition of what the expectation

262
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,910
is with the reminder that it depends on the fixed

263
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,250
temperature, expectation, value. The energy is

264
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,890
just the sum of the microstates of the energy of

265
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,190
each state, whether by the probability of the

266
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,430
system adopting that microstates that's coming

267
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,840
back from the first unit on the probability

268
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,120
definition's, it's like again. Now, the problem is

269
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,580
that we have computed gives this expression where?

270
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:01,200
We have. We saw over microstates of that

271
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,500
exponential Boltzmann factor, we divide the energy,

272
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,430
which is actually similar to something we saw just

273
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:16,200
on the previous page, albeit with a different

274
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,680
interpretation of the probabilities as

275
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,250
probabilities for a particular system of interest

276
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,340
to adopt a micro state rather than occupation.

277
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,330
Probabilities for what micro state we would be

278
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,750
likely to see for various replicas of those

279
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:42,450
replicas have now gone away and. We can interpret.

280
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,560
The same sort of calculation that we did now in

281
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:53,710
terms just of the system itself, so the derivative

282
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,280
of the one percent is one of resetting times, the

283
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,820
derivative with respect to data. The definition

284
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,330
for that as the sum of the microstates of each of

285
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,530
the minus. I am taking the derivative love you

286
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,520
just heard of that song,

287
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:19,650
you just end up with how of the negative energy

288
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,560
for each microstates is turning into some

289
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:28,260
exponential factor sticks around and we can then.

290
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,490
Replace the exponential factor by the

291
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:38,590
probabilities the negative side comes up front and

292
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,810
end up with. Now the average with the expectation

293
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,820
value for the internal energy of our economical

294
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:53,200
system related to the derivative of the log of the

295
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,200
partition function with respect to the inverse

296
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,330
temperature. And in this case, it was easier to

297
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,220
work with the inverse temperature and take a

298
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,900
derivative of better times rather than working

299
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,270
with the temperature, taking the derivative to

300
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,360
divide it by the temperature. It's easy enough to

301
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,630
use the chain rule to swap back and forth between

302
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,940
these two equivalent ways of expressing the

303
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,750
temperature, either directly or in terms of its

304
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,490
inverse. Theta just brings in a factor of negative

305
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,750
T squared relating to derivative. So it's.

306
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:41,750
Maybe a useful check to rerun that this derivative

307
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,090
computation in terms of the temperature rather

308
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:49,000
than its inverse. But given this relation now

309
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,020
between energy and official function, we can.

310
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,470
Note something interesting, which is already a

311
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,070
benefit to working in economic terms rather than

312
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,690
micro canonical and part of the reason why. The

313
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,530
canonical ensemble is called a canonical, ordinary

314
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,720
or typical approach, you want to ask what happens

315
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,500
to this internal energy related to the protection

316
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,210
function as the fixed temperature of the canonical

317
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:32,910
ensemble varies? This is similar to. The question

318
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,210
that we put in the opposite terms on the previous

319
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,550
year. No, not at all. Some of the.

320
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,580
How does the temperature of the number of

321
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,570
microstates depend on the energy available

322
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,160
biotechnical case here?

323
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,450
We can define it's called a heat capacity to be

324
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,710
directly this dependence of the energy on the

325
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:05,830
temperature. So just the derivative of the average

326
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,500
internal energy that we have an expression to

327
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,280
extract from the petition function improbabilities

328
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:18,310
and we can see, which I think will be included in

329
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,290
the homework for the next couple of weeks, that

330
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:28,840
this kid's capacity for an economical system is

331
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,800
always negative and turns out to be zero only in

332
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:39,400
special circumstances. And what this amounts to is

333
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,850
the. Statement that we will always be working with

334
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,210
so-called natural systems for the economical

335
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,030
approach imposes this natural behavior that we

336
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:56,020
expect at higher energies correspond to higher

337
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,260
temperatures and vice versa, which was only true

338
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,290
in certain situations in the canonical approach.

339
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,420
So just by changing the perspective to fix the

340
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,060
temperature rather than the energy, we have

341
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,840
avoided some of the strange behavior we

342
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,230
encountered with microeconomic ensemble. And we

343
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,660
don't have to worry about specifying whether or

344
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,820
not systems are natural that comes out of the

345
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:26,710
construction that we are putting in place. The

346
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,130
only problem will be an interesting one. The way

347
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:35,260
to show that the sea capacity is not negative is

348
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,920
to look at fluctuations of the energy about its

349
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:45,130
expectation of value and as a special case of a

350
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:48,970
fairly general of the size of the fluctuation,

351
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,980
dissipation or fluctuation response through. This

352
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,770
can be related to how the energy changes and

353
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,770
responds to a change in the temperature given by

354
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,520
the derivative of

355
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,040
the.

356
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,340
The terminology of calling that dissipation is

357
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:12,000
maybe a bit more dated because it's a relation

358
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,870
between the fluctuations of the energy in the sub

359
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,060
over microstates of the canonical ensemble.

360
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,320
Connected to the response of that energy to change

361
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,220
in some fixed control parameter, in this case the

362
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:33,530
temperature. He is going to be something useful to

363
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,520
explore.

364
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,110
So are there questions about. Internal energy or

365
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,700
heat capacity at this.

366
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,490
Sort of basic, almost definitional level and

367
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,290
economical on some level.

368
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What other derived quantity that we will quickly

369
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,380
relate to the.

370
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:09,580
Expression's and. Partition function. And

371
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,480
probabilities that we have available is, of course,

372
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,330
the entropy. This is where we started driving.

373
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,490
Driving observables in the MicroCon approach is.

374
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,890
Just as important, if not more so, in the

375
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,220
canonical ensemble that we're directly maps on to

376
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,170
day

377
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,380
situations and the general definition of the

378
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,430
entropy that is independent of what ensemble we

379
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:45,890
consider, what quantity is fixed. Is this what we

380
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,410
started off with last week as some of the

381
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:53,630
microstates of this very transparent, opaque,

382
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:57,330
non-transparent product of the probability times

383
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:57,980
their lord?

384
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,200
So that's coming from that equation to see what we

385
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,350
need to do is just insert the probabilities that

386
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,750
we have for the canonical ensemble and as in a

387
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:18,700
previous calculations, turns out to be. Quicker

388
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:24,520
just to expand the logarithm and keep the other

389
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,640
factor of the probabilities floating around for

390
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,230
the time being. So the probability that the system

391
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:39,530
is in microstates, I. With energy, Eastby is.

392
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,090
That's both the distribution and then the

393
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,370
calculation follows through from the properties of

394
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,780
that law. So the.

395
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,560
More to the product is the sum of the logs and the

396
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:01,680
border, the inverse is the biggest. So we have a

397
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,030
negative Wanstead and then the of the exponential

398
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:11,800
function is going to bring down a negative data. I

399
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,840
can't let you go go negative, Simon.

400
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:24,960
And some of the I p e. The negative signs cancel

401
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,340
here as well. The mindset is constant, as with

402
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,300
some of the microstates. So we just have this

403
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,330
first term sum of all probabilities has to go to

404
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,900
one. And in the second term, we recognize the

405
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,010
expectation value.

406
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:46,710
For the internal energy, so we become a logarithm

407
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:52,860
of the petition function plus. By the times, the

408
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,930
expectation value for the internal energy, we can

409
00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:01,690
also write equivalently in terms of the

410
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,720
temperature that is fixed and the canonical

411
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,470
approach, and we do see the promised dependence on

412
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,140
the logarithm of the production function here,

413
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,500
which is not something that can easily be

414
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,750
simplified, recalling that the production function

415
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:21,530
is the sum overall microstates it's. Encompassing

416
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,790
the information about all of those microstates and

417
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:32,980
their individual energy is. But the appearance of

418
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,640
this logarithm of the partition function, both in

419
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:42,880
the entropy as well as this, as a derivative of

420
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,860
expression for. The expectation value is, as you

421
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,040
suggest, or I guess confirm something that I

422
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,100
forecast earlier, that the prediction function

423
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:57,270
really is the fundamental equality in the economic

424
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,280
approach. The general starting point from which

425
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,660
all of these other derived observables like energy,

426
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,410
intrepidity, capacity and eventually more can be

427
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:18,010
derived. And given this of central role of the

428
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:22,120
petition function, in particular, the logarithm,

429
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,100
the petition function that we're seeing

430
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,600
specifically it is useful for practical

431
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,250
calculations. To.

432
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:38,930
Define the quantity related to the longer the

433
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:43,250
production function that has dimensions of energy

434
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,460
and can be. Used essentially to simplify or

435
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,620
streamline some of the dictation and the

436
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,550
calculations. And this is what is known as a free

437
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:59,620
energy. And in the specific case of the class,

438
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,140
it's called the help of three energy, named after

439
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:09,400
19th century German physicist Helmholtz, which we

440
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,360
defined to be equivalent with working in terms of

441
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:16,750
temperature or the inverse of the logarithm, the

442
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,170
petition function. Times the negative temperature.

443
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,860
We're divided by the negative of the inverse

444
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,410
temperature.

445
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,180
Which.

446
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:38,440
Just to restate the fundamental. Some objects we

447
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,450
are working with the probabilities.

448
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,990
Which we can recall are whatever is in time is the

449
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:51,430
ultimate factor into the minus energy over tea can

450
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:57,880
be recast into a overall exponential factor. The.

451
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:05,140
Tons of free energy that defines the overall

452
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,230
behavior of the entire system, some over all of

453
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:11,050
the microstates minus the energy for the

454
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,940
particular microstates which monitor this

455
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,270
probability, all normalize by the temperature in

456
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,990
the argument that exponential, which is already

457
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,310
bringing in the. Simply expression for the

458
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:27,600
petition itself, just as the exponential of the

459
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,730
negative free energy divided by temperature, which

460
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,940
is just inverting this equation. Thirty seven.

461
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:44,790
Given this definition of the free energy and all

462
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:50,210
of the projectable, see how close I can get.

463
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:02,960
The usefulness of defining this. Quantity based on

464
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,150
the production function is reveal.

465
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,920
In particular, when we had computers, derivatives

466
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:13,380
with or without actors of T so just.

467
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,580
Collecting this temperature derivative of the

468
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,520
water, the petition function, which is related to

469
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,990
the derivative with respect to data that we. Look

470
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,930
at to define the average internal energy, that's

471
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:34,110
what this equation. Thirty five is.

472
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,400
I have space up here, that was a thirty five,

473
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,220
which is the relation that the derivative with

474
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,390
respect to beta differs from the derivative with

475
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,870
respect to temperature by the overall factor of

476
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:55,500
minus two squared. So in that relation to, say, a

477
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,650
minus one over a few squared. Can he be beat up or

478
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:07,480
is it a up and this is. What we computed is the

479
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,820
negative expectation value of the internal energy.

480
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:20,250
The negatives then cancel out. So this derivative

481
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:25,250
of the. How much free energy normalized by

482
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:31,170
temperature gives us the. Average internal energy

483
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,490
normalized by a squared, which we can then look

484
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:35,980
into.

485
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:44,020
Slightly. More complicated derivative of the free

486
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:48,190
energy itself. So that expression is now

487
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,870
reproduced here.

488
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,740
First term is the.

489
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,910
Trivial, long said, derivative of T with respect

490
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:04,860
to this one, and then be the one that negative T.

491
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:12,160
The ones that were included above. So this is the

492
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,450
logarithm of that is the negative free energy

493
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:20,090
property that's negative for cancer services or

494
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,000
free energy itself, divided by two.

495
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,990
And then the second term brings in the specter of

496
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,220
average thermal energy over T-square times t that

497
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,020
negative sign comes along.

498
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,450
And we can check.

499
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,930
This is the expression, the computer earlier in

500
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:48,010
the week for the entropy is a function of T with

501
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,310
an overall negative side logarithm of Z, plus the

502
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,420
average internal energy only divided by T, and we

503
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,990
can confirm that all the units are matching up.

504
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,250
And all the terms of this expression is promised,

505
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,640
the couple's free energy has the same units as

506
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,930
neutral energy. And in the system of units we are

507
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,470
working with, energy and temperature have the same

508
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,650
dimensions than just the dimensionless entropy

509
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,750
coming out at the end.

510
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:24,960
So the.

511
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,250
The main observers will be interested in, at least

512
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,170
for the remainder of this year, the entropy and

513
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:37,870
average energy assumptions of T.. Now, I have

514
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,580
several expressions related to the Helmholtz free

515
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:46,360
energy, the centrifuges, the negative of the

516
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,970
temperature, derivative of the almost free energy

517
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,450
and the energy is that the temperature at times

518
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,300
entropy plus the free energy.

519
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:02,870
So those are. Ways of recasting some of the

520
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:07,010
previous general expressions in terms of the

521
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,270
border partisan function now showing up as this

522
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,860
free energy and relation between. Energy and

523
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:19,510
entropy, which will actually spend a few minutes

524
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:26,670
applying this to. Specific systems, having gone

525
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:31,560
through the general generic derivation of what

526
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,000
these quantities are, how they are related. And

527
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,580
before diving into battle paths again to see if

528
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,610
there are any questions or objections about.

529
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,800
General Foundation formulation of the economic

530
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,630
approach that we've done.

531
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,090
So there is time to at least start looking at a

532
00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:01,520
first application of. The canonical example that

533
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,120
we have now defined mathematically justify that

534
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,400
and related between the fundamental microsleep,

535
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,140
probability is partition function and derive

536
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:17,310
quantities like energy and entropy. And maybe not

537
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,720
surprisingly, we are. Going to focus on that same

538
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,000
sort of storm systems that we've talked about a

539
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,750
few times in the past couple of units will be

540
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:32,050
looking in particular about the role of

541
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:37,520
information in these systems. By considering two

542
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,630
possible setups that differ only by the amount of

543
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:46,810
information that is knowable in principle. About

544
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,450
each of these spent systems, so this is connected

545
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,640
to what is a.

546
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,850
Important and hot topic in ongoing research,

547
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,990
especially once we bring in. Quantum field theory,

548
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:04,140
general relativity and all the other pillars of

549
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,450
modern physics, statistical physics has to

550
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:12,840
interact with the relevant regimes, the. The

551
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,460
dependence of systems on the information content,

552
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,110
what information is knowable about the principle

553
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,370
is.

554
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,620
Is subject still with a lot of uncertainty and

555
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,770
debates in particular related to what's called the

556
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:34,300
black hole information paradox, which is trying to

557
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,230
figure out how precisely or precisely how

558
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,040
information that falls into a black hole or regime

559
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,140
there, both general relativity and quantum physics

560
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:51,790
is important how that information is processed.

561
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,880
Preserved and eventually admitted in the hawking

562
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,120
radiation as that black hole evaporates over time,

563
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:02,090
which is part of the thermodynamics of black holes

564
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:06,320
and other contacts that you may have time to look

565
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,210
at just at the very end of the course where

566
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,520
there's strange behavior like negative

567
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:16,910
temperatures and systems that. Get get the colder,

568
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:21,480
the more energy they bring in, that's the general

569
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,290
motivation for picking up information in general,

570
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,070
the concrete calculations we'll be doing is

571
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:34,230
considering two to four to. Variations of the same

572
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:40,770
system and spins which. In one case, the spinach

573
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,830
will be distinguishable from each other in

574
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,100
principle, this.

575
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,070
In the other case, the spinners will be

576
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:52,610
indistinguishable in the way that we can set this

577
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:57,770
up physically. Is by fixing this belongs to a

578
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:03,080
particular position or allowing them to move in.

579
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:08,720
In whatever container is contained, they'll start

580
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,850
with the. Distinguishable case where the idea is

581
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:17,090
that the spin degrees of freedom will be

582
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:24,990
considering. Are all arranged in a line. And. In a

583
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:30,880
settlement that field. So repeat the ruling we had

584
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,350
earlier, some excellent field and spins that could

585
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:40,690
be aligned with or against it. And we will further

586
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:46,240
specify that these films are what form?

587
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,820
A solid material, so they may be identified with

588
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:54,460
the atoms and some crystal of the sound

589
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,500
like a building, for instance, the physical

590
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,170
context in which these systems were first

591
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:07,710
developed. And in this cell, the molecules that

592
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,780
correspond to these and other titles in this case

593
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:15,110
are fixed. They're not allowed to move around.

594
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:22,750
They can. Only align with or against the magnetic

595
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:26,230
field, and because they are associated with a

596
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:31,510
particular point in this solid, an observer can

597
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,690
look at that particular point and know that it is

598
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,280
that particular spin that has been observed by

599
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:48,020
focusing on a well-defined region in the solid.

600
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,230
In the canonical approach to generalizing the

601
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:02,670
microphone system we looked at earlier, too, now

602
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:08,100
allowing the energies of the microstates to to

603
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:13,260
vary all possible to the sort of equals to the end

604
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:18,090
configurations of these and spin's align our

605
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:22,830
values microstates with generally different energy

606
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:26,760
use and now different probabilities of being

607
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,760
adopted, exponentially suppressed by those

608
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,250
energies. And that's the time remaining.

609
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,670
We'll introduce a bit of a different, more

610
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:44,760
efficient notation for the systems, rather than

611
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,520
having to draw lots of arrows pointing either up

612
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,670
or down, and we'll represent appointing spins by

613
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,320
just an integer from a six one minus one. So

614
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:04,350
whenever. The value of this degree of freedom at

615
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:09,340
distinguishable speed and equals one that will be

616
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,630
point you spend aligned parallel to the magnetic

617
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:16,410
field, contributing a negative edge to the energy

618
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,270
and the downward pointing spins, or Angelyne

619
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,690
contributing a positive H to the energy so that

620
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:29,100
the total energy get that back realign. And the

621
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:33,750
projector is just now easily expressed in terms of

622
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:38,440
these n spin variables, plus or minus one with an

623
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,050
overall factor of negative. So this is the total

624
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:47,610
energy of the particular microstates eye, which is

625
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:54,250
specified in full by the configuration of the as a

626
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,600
set of integers that are plus or minus or

627
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,490
responding to upward and downward pointing spins.

628
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:02,520
So.

629
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:07,750
As we will see repeatedly and economic approach,

630
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:11,150
the starting point is the production function

631
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:16,050
called sense of the word, emphasize the

632
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:19,130
sensibility of these business and that petition

633
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,820
function is the sum over all of the possible

634
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,990
microstates. So on to the power and possible

635
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,210
configurations as Ceylan.

636
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,450
Which. Looks like. At the basic level, this factor

637
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:41,410
here, the Boltzmann factor, exponential minus

638
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,370
better times, energy, something over the two

639
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:49,000
values, plus or minus one of all of these spin

640
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,750
degrees of freedom as one through. So there are

641
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:58,330
enormous sums each over to of these. Where the.

642
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,950
Degrees of freedom being sucked over, the speed

643
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:04,980
variables a sudden appear in the.

644
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,810
Determination of the total energy of the

645
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:13,440
microstates that shows up in The Factor. Now,

646
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,520
since all of these spins are independent of each

647
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,380
other, they don't interact with each other, the

648
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,410
entities depend only on their orientation up or

649
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:26,100
down and not what any other spin is doing. We can

650
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,540
expand this exponential of the sun to be a product

651
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,870
of exponential growth and then redistributes all

652
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:37,800
of those factors in the product to the

653
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,270
corresponding sum over the two plus or minus spin

654
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:42,840
states.

655
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,700
In this overall sum over to the impossibility, so

656
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:54,800
we end up with any factors of two terms each.

657
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:01,790
And the factors, so this product just boils down

658
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:06,580
to a single. Some of the two possibilities raised

659
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:10,240
to the power in those two possibilities are Bess's

660
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,130
plus one, we have the exponential with the

661
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:17,680
positive arguments I've called X and magnetic

662
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,670
field divided by temperature. And similarly, when

663
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,810
this is negative one, we just pick up the negative

664
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:27,190
side in that argument, which you can recognize as

665
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:31,120
the hyperbolic cosine of this dimension, this kind

666
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:33,750
of magnetic field strength divided by temperature

667
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:40,550
with that factor. Up to the cosh to the sound of

668
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,150
the Excellency's, minus six, all raised to the

669
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:44,720
power at.

670
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:54,860
So. Maybe just wrapping up with the breaking down

671
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:57,110
the Helmholtz energy, it's simple enough, take the

672
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:02,070
rhythm of. This quantity that breaks down to we

673
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,530
have the logarithm of the argument two times of

674
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:09,330
hyperbolic, cosine and dividing by making the

675
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:15,420
better just gives. This expression for the

676
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,390
helpless, we understand that next week we will.

677
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:22,670
Turn through the expressions we've derived for the

678
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:25,840
democracy and interview to see how those behave

679
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:31,610
for the system wrap up there. We you seen set up

680
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:34,880
for this distinguishable, spent to resolve other

681
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,150
questions about anything we've seen so far this

682
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:38,450
week.

683
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:48,270
I guess I will have hopefully see you again this

684
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:51,840
afternoon, unless the storm shut everything down

685
00:48:52,950 --> 00:49:00,390
on the. Look at some more aspects of Al Gore's

686
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:06,510
numbers, the. We'll exercise the post last week,

687
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,420
as well as some derivations related disturbance,

688
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,110
one can be a fun way to spend some time on a

689
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:15,740
Friday afternoon. See you that.

690
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:26,030
That.
