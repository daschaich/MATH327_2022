1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:08,670
All right, welcome back to Friday afternoon.  As

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,700
a reminder before I forget, the University will be closed for

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,880
the bank holiday on Monday. So after this, I'll see

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,910
you again in the other room Tuesday morning.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,200
Another thing I don't want to forget is the six-digit code for

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:31,220
this afternoon: one three, five five, zero zero.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,530
And then I have three things planned that we could

8
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,290
have some fun with this afternoon.  But of course,

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,800
this is also your opportunity to bring up any

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,580
issues or questions or concerns about what's been

11
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,430
going on in the course that you may want to discuss

12
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,580
more detail, so before I dive into what I have

13
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,950
planned, let's see if there's any

14
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,420
issues you want to raise or questions to ask.

15
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,780
And it may well be that some of the questions on

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,780
your mind are concerned with the first topic at

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,790
about 4:00 today, which was just a few quick

18
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,690
comments on generic feedback on the solutions,

19
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,560
that homework that came back to you over the edge

20
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,720
of the break. Where we got mentioned on Monday

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,680
that the markets were generally reasonable average.

22
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,500
Sixty nine, plus or minus 16 is a standard

23
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,950
deviation. And no one question that really stood

24
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,490
out as particularly challenging or not. The. On

25
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,840
the whole, the. Most marks came from this first

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,150
question about the.

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,950
Drift and diffusion of oil droplets model, as they

28
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:15,600
would do in a random walk. And. Here to the. The

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,750
key step was just this change of variables.

30
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,920
To something that depends all the time that the

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,770
war in Iraq is progressing and this is the key

32
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,240
because it makes the. Could you grab the

33
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,770
probability distribution symmetric in you so

34
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,220
fucking you divide us, you.

35
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,520
Is asymmetry of the probability distribution,

36
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,410
which is not the case for the distribution and the

37
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,890
function of X, precisely Duse that on. So most

38
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,710
folks were able to realize that they wanted to

39
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,870
account for the whole integral over all possible

40
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,900
positions of this random walk, give the one

41
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,010
hundred percent probability for locating the oil

42
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,900
in question and then break that up into the error

43
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,540
function region around symmetric around zero.

44
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,540
Along with the remainder we are actually

45
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,410
interested in.

46
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,390
And that cemetery is only possible to identify

47
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,480
after making that kind of pendant change of

48
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,020
variables after which the solution. Boils down to

49
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,970
solving a quadratic equation there, Ali, or by

50
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,390
hand.

51
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,620
Question two was the. One, that.

52
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,680
People seem to find it easy to sell the whole

53
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,740
latest America works, even though there was a bit

54
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,080
of a funny business with the.

55
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,000
The final bit about what happens when the systems

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,490
with positive and negative temperature are brought

57
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,570
into verbal contact and be able to exchange energy,

58
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,570
which reminds me that I actually set up a little

59
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,180
illustration of this beyond what went into the

60
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:26,100
solutions. I can actually recover a few seconds.

61
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,350
On here.

62
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,350
So the.

63
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,590
This is interesting because I have definitely

64
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,160
opened this up recently that are showing up here.

65
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,190
Did you hear this negative temperature?

66
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,700
Open and.

67
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,130
Looking at the expressions in in the first two

68
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,550
parts of this problem where the entropy is the.

69
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,650
Just difference between the full and and minus

70
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,710
whatever fraction are in the positive energy US

71
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,960
state. Which of these degrees of freedom have that

72
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:37,610
not zero energy absolom so that. That number is

73
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,720
known as X. We can put in any arbitrary large

74
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,790
numbers for the total number of degrees of freedom.

75
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,970
And as we've seen before, this entropy has

76
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,260
maximized.

77
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,610
Right in the middle, when half of the degrees of

78
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,930
freedom are in one of the two possible. Energy

79
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,100
levels and the other half are the other one, but

80
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,690
of course, this. Maximum is interesting because it

81
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,220
means that the slope is zero and that slope is the

82
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,360
inverse temperature. So here's the derivative. So

83
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,760
Epsilon over t dimensionless units that crosses

84
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,670
zero rates at the point where the entropy is

85
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,390
maximized. Which corresponds to. As most people

86
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,200
found the temperature that diverges at that same

87
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,840
point, the inverse of this derivative.

88
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,310
Now, the connection that this has to the final

89
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,820
part of the question. Has to do with the.

90
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,640
Connection between the energy and temperature. So

91
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,120
the question was phrased a little baby is what

92
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,850
happens when systems of positive and negative

93
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,220
temperature are brought into trouble contact. So

94
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,050
looking at this part, that's one system on the

95
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,100
left, half of the frame. No contact with the

96
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:12,950
system on the right half. And if you. Look back at

97
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,960
the calculation done in unit to see that the

98
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,920
energy would kind of flow from the system with

99
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,760
more energy on the right half of this grid system,

100
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,050
with less energy on the left half. Which has.

101
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,190
Somewhat counter intuitive impact on the

102
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,550
temperature itself, so as the system that has

103
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,370
negative temperature and the right half gives up

104
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,910
energy to the other system, it moves closer toward

105
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,710
those that midpoints and therefore picks up a more

106
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,570
negative temperature. Whereas the other system

107
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,920
that is giving energy, the positive temperature is

108
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,000
moving to a higher temperature at the same time to

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,990
be temperature. So the two systems are actually

110
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,840
moving further apart as they're brought into

111
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,780
contact is becoming increasingly positive

112
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,300
temperature, the other increasingly negative,

113
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,760
which did a few folks up who based this on sort of.

114
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,090
Usual intuition that if you have two systems with

115
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,080
different temperatures and the thermal contact

116
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,440
that will try to approach the same temperature

117
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,450
rather than wandering off to temperatures further

118
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,330
and further apart. So that is another way that

119
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,160
these negative temperatures coming from the

120
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,490
canonical ensemble are counterintuitive and in

121
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,070
fact, more generally to the convention here. You

122
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,320
can prove that. Temperatures only 10 to

123
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,100
equilibrated between two such systems if the heat

124
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,450
capacity is always positive. That heat capacity

125
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,070
being the derivative of the energy with respect to

126
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,360
temperature.

127
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:16,510
So that is a even though this question what is? So

128
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,070
hard for most folks. There are interesting

129
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,470
connections that are more broadly.

130
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:31,420
And question three is mostly calculational, the

131
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,600
only place where. Folks are sometimes in danger of

132
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:43,200
getting tripped up was in the small second part of

133
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,830
it, asking essentially what the result means in

134
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:52,500
terms. So when we find the heat capacity is

135
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,300
proportional to the square of these fluctuations,

136
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,510
what does that mean for the microwave energy use,

137
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,800
which requires some care to distinguish between

138
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,260
was microwave energy supply rather than the energy

139
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,640
expectation value that sums over all possible

140
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,810
microstates with the probability distribution. And

141
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:25,230
some folks try to comment on. In this part of the

142
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,800
question, so rather than. Pulling out the

143
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,700
microwave energy and seeing what could be said

144
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,180
about it

145
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:44,420
was tempting to just say that if. Derivative of

146
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,030
the expectation value. And if it was, then.

147
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,120
You are tempted to say that this means that the

148
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,700
energy expectation value must be independent of

149
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,290
temperature, which.

150
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,160
Is not always true because we are considering just

151
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,250
a single point with a capacity advantage, rather

152
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,000
than requiring requiring that it be zero for all

153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,900
temperatures and is also focusing on the wrong.

154
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,030
Variable, there's a big difference between that

155
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,110
expectation value and the individual state energy

156
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:31,000
use that we are able to. Determined must be. All

157
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,910
the same for every microstates in the system, but

158
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,130
not necessarily the same for different

159
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:36,820
temperatures.

160
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:40,780
That's.

161
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,120
Quickly, Mark, in there,

162
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,960
similarly with regard on the final question, which

163
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,540
was a lot of fairly straightforward. Computations

164
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,320
and approximations, the trickiest aspect of this

165
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,670
is the high temperature expansion. There are.

166
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,610
Nontrivial series expansions to keep track of

167
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,690
where. In particular, in this actually in the

168
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,090
expansion of this ratio, one over one minus the

169
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:25,740
expense of minus X. It's sometimes tempting to.

170
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:33,140
Expand the denominator there just to be order in X

171
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,440
that you think you want to end up with the apple,

172
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,160
so to get.

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,460
The leading coefficient here, I expect to be the

174
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,850
leading coefficient that doesn't cancel the

175
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,780
dominator, but as we can see from Converse's, the

176
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,700
expression of the exponential expansion of this

177
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,880
geometric series actually have to keep terms to

178
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,610
execute power and the denominator in order to end

179
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,530
up with something that is accurate only to order X.

180
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,860
And similarly, what's the other an exponential

181
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,610
factor in that ratio is brought in, it has to be

182
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,590
expanded to.

183
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,950
Order. Peter Square, which is the square variable

184
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,130
in order to end up with something in the end, that

185
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,460
is order Batel just due to the cancellations that

186
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,540
are coming out from enumerator and laminator, so.

187
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,020
Those are the sort of highlights of each of the

188
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,250
four questions, the. The main issues are the

189
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,000
better connections to interesting aspects of

190
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,220
physical physics there. Any further questions that

191
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,190
we want to follow up on about

192
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,210
that first homework assignment?

193
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,400
Since I'm not seeing any, I will move on to your

194
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:22,340
second. Third piece is the more fun, somewhat more

195
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,490
fun, the two year olds have been out of the core

196
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,770
content for the module.

197
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,960
Interesting and fun to think about and do some

198
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:41,220
calculations with, in particular in. This tutorial

199
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,690
problem here, which I just put on the Web site. A

200
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,960
few minutes before we started this afternoon, I've.

201
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,730
Got a bit of background material about different

202
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,720
forms of nanostructures and why they matter go

203
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,650
through that, it's a brief presentation of both

204
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,800
some conceptual questions that we'll get through

205
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,240
this afternoon and then a more challenging

206
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,110
calculational question, which was actually what I

207
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,360
was thinking about putting on the second homework

208
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,210
assignment, but decided it would be a bit to mean

209
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,200
someone just talk about it this week and we

210
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,920
actually expect to leave it for you to be able to

211
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,350
think about over the holiday in the coming week.

212
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,800
So.

213
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,630
In the work that we've done so far this week of

214
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,970
the easy model and will continue doing, we've

215
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,890
focused just on. That model to find out what same

216
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,680
dimensions that were shown in the left side of

217
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,990
this figure here, but of course, there is a large

218
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,380
number of different possibilities for the lack of

219
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,740
structure that we have where we can define these

220
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,890
sorts of interactive systems, a lot of which bring

221
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,220
in.

222
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,510
Important information coming not from the form of

223
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,400
the interaction itself or from the degrees of

224
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,780
freedom, but how they are organized both in

225
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,960
physical experiments as well as more abstract

226
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,940
mathematical considerations. So the little ladies

227
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,730
here, for instance, is the political class that

228
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:37,570
was mentioned in passing on Monday that. Tom is

229
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,840
the latest, the graphene is far better than

230
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,890
essentially the reason graphene has some

231
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,360
remarkable

232
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,430
properties, both electronic and structural, is

233
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,380
that it consists of this very regular lattice of

234
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,290
storage, which we can distinguish from the the

235
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,170
square lattice in a few ways. The simplest is by

236
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,130
looking at how many various neighbors in a given

237
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,840
site house for the square lattice. We've seen that

238
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,850
a given site has. For years, neighbors to

239
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:19,130
symbolized to two times the nearest neighbors

240
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,770
delimiters. Can easily see here for this two

241
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,850
dimensional optical lattice at any given site as

242
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,730
not four, but three nearest neighbors, which. Also

243
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:39,180
turns out to be related to the dimensionality of

244
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,380
the system, the coordination number that I'm

245
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,320
describing here, which is just a fancy term for

246
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,300
the nearest neighbor sites that any given site has,

247
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,940
as always, with periodic battery conditions for

248
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,550
this honeycomb structure that.

249
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,880
Coordination number is the plus one in these

250
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,860
dimensions. Where higher dimensional

251
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,990
generalizations of. How do you come last if you

252
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,050
can wrap your head around how to visualize those,

253
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,240
which I have a difficulty with our doing this

254
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,090
hyperthyroid analysis and show up in mostly

255
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,710
theoretical work, but we're. And then.

256
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,370
In that area, so this nikolaidis is relevant for

257
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,210
Graffy, the reason it has such tensile strength,

258
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:43,920
conductivity and so on. In investigations of. High

259
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,500
temperature superconductivity, so trying to

260
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,710
manufacture materials that superconductor at a

261
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,750
higher temperature that lead to Kelvin, where the

262
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,780
twisted by the graphene system has its

263
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,080
superconducting phase transition.

264
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,410
Decades of work in physics labs all over the world

265
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,960
have tried to design and manufacture materials

266
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,920
that undergo that sort of superconducting phase

267
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,930
transition at the highest possible temperature,

268
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,250
trying to get close to room temperature of 300

269
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,840
degrees so that we can burn electronics and

270
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,930
electrical systems without losing any energy to

271
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:33,870
waste heat. I had. All sorts of language, lattices,

272
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,530
and these three dimensional materials played key

273
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,030
roles, and in that process, just as a quick

274
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:47,400
illustration of the will force me to zoom out a

275
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,830
bit.

276
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,130
This is.

277
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,640
It was from that. Wikipedia is showing a class of

278
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,680
superconducting materials.

279
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,860
To times where there are different options of

280
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,460
exactly which atoms get inserted into these

281
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,340
complicated layered structures.

282
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,300
Which depending on how exactly. The.

283
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,320
At the time the species are chosen and what

284
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,570
percentage of them are selected. So the process

285
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,780
that is probably shouldn't get distracted by

286
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,980
talking about the critical temperature for

287
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,980
superconductivity and materials of this sort can

288
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,570
be pushed all the way up to around 50 Kelvin, one

289
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,650
sixth of the way from two Kelvin superconductivity,

290
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,060
trusted by the graphene.

291
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,250
On the way to three hundred Kelvin room

292
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,280
temperature, this is sort of the state of the art

293
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,740
and ordinary pressures where you can see that in

294
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,700
addition to the complicated connections between

295
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,480
these different species that allow the electrons

296
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,440
to flow without any resistance at low temperatures,

297
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,120
there's also a larger scale superstructure between

298
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:27,140
the. Alternating layers of the system, the

299
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,950
protective layer to the Clintonian layer down at

300
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,310
the bottom. So that's just a bit of practical

301
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,550
application to motivate considering some of these

302
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,580
different structures. The third one here just

303
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,790
finished going through that list.

304
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,080
Is probably trying to get us motivated by the

305
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,800
trials that you can see out there where any given

306
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,300
site now has a coordination number of six.

307
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,330
Which is twice the coordination of the political

308
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,590
homeless and essentially can be obtained from the

309
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:16,590
hurricane. Lettuce by filling in the sensors of

310
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,970
each cell.

311
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,910
Like still, as an illustration filling in, that

312
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,370
hexagon produces triangles and doubles the

313
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:33,630
coordination number and. And as always, there are

314
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:38,040
higher dimensional generalizations, all this is a

315
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:44,190
star lattices where the body centered Cubitt was

316
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,420
drawn. Here is the simplest example, moving up

317
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,170
from two to three dimensions. Using some different

318
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:59,870
colors to. Highlight the simple Kubic lattice that

319
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:05,530
is embedded. Within the body center that Cuban is,

320
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,280
where if you go through and count the number of

321
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,650
links connecting any of these sites to all of

322
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,820
their dearest neighbors, you will reproduce that

323
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:24,520
same. Two times B plus one, where three quarters

324
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,760
of the age she's at that level for that central

325
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,750
purple sides can give all the sites that it is

326
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,630
connected to. That is the purple site is sitting

327
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,860
in the center of the body of a simple tube defined

328
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:45,020
by those eight, which is that terminology used by

329
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,990
synergy devices come from. And before diving into

330
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,720
work for you to do, I'll just mentioned that this

331
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,580
coordination number is a characteristic of all of

332
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,690
these different matter structures, but it's not a

333
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,810
unique characteristic. You can have different

334
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:09,900
lattices with the same coordination number, which

335
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,580
is I had included this. Type of a structure here,

336
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:21,190
which also has information number for the same as

337
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,010
the square lattice, obviously a. Different

338
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:31,260
distribution of. Use for your state was given

339
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:36,240
different interactions and. You get a different

340
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,690
visual appearance, so. With that little bit of

341
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,730
time spent, time, day.

342
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,390
Best trendspotting, that excursion, we're going to

343
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:54,520
think about what happens to the easing model if we

344
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,780
define it on these lattices, which is to say that

345
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,260
the nearest neighbor is Shakila, that we some over

346
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:07,440
is now given by some by the structural design

347
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,860
beyond the simple human case that we've been

348
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,130
considering in the lectures.

349
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,500
What makes this especially interesting is that we

350
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,970
generalize it is immoral to have a tunable

351
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,500
parameter controlling the shrimp of distracting

352
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:31,850
term, so. The energy is given by the somewhat of a

353
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:38,150
task of our nearest neighbor take scale by this

354
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:43,520
confidence factor, which whenever GAO is positive,

355
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,360
it's pretty trivial just to scale things through a

356
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,790
redefinition of what we mean by spin and get

357
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,510
exactly the same physics as the GAO equals one

358
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,280
case that we've been considering.

359
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,990
But some different things happen if Jay becomes

360
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,250
Negatus and three pairs of alliance teams

361
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,520
contribute to a positive energy rather than

362
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,120
negative energy that we've been considering. So

363
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,630
just a few minutes. And possibly, possibly for

364
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,270
five minutes to consider a couple of conceptual

365
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:26,560
questions just about this set up with reference to

366
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,750
the very simple lattice structures, square

367
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,760
honeycomb triangular that don't quite fit on the

368
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,890
screen at the same time.

369
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:44,810
The. First question is all six of these cases, the

370
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,980
three letter structures and the two choices for.

371
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,190
The interactions from the side of the interaction

372
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,640
strength.

373
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:00,210
What is the Granite State, the state of energy,

374
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,140
possibly multiple different states in each of

375
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,370
those cases and building recall, that means you

376
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:14,400
have a sense of what the state is, what is or is

377
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,070
there or a parameter that could distinguish the

378
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:23,550
ground states from the disorder, microstates that

379
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:28,650
we generally expect to dominate the system at high

380
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:33,450
temperatures. So this is the answers to these

381
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:38,260
questions are. The starting point to consider if

382
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:43,220
there is a. If there exists two different places

383
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,760
and if so, whether there is a true face transition

384
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,800
between them, so

385
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,380
a few minutes to think about that and feel free to

386
00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:01,140
shout out if. Any of the. Set up or the point of

387
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,880
this question is not clear.

388
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:21,380
But as well as the recording of that. Yes, will

389
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,680
help if I presume that require a limit and.

390
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,960
I'm guessing there will be no objections if I

391
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:38,700
claim that. In the case of a positive job, grouses

392
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,810
that you have found, at least conceptually, are

393
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,210
the same as the ones that we looked at, a class of

394
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,620
30 square Latisse with a positive J equals one is

395
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,510
exactly what we considered a class immigrant

396
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,260
status, where all the spins aligned in the same

397
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:55,900
direction.

398
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,170
Particularly in the case where we consider the

399
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,460
zero field limits, there's no distinction between

400
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,180
all the spin to the top or plus one and all of

401
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,320
them pointed down minus minus one. That's also the

402
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,190
same case for any of these three lattice

403
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,060
structures to generate round stakes in all three

404
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,750
cases.

405
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,140
With all spins aligned in the same direction.

406
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:35,820
What about the case of the negative interaction

407
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:40,900
strengths, which are less than zero? I. Claimed

408
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,630
was qualitatively different than that.

409
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,930
Any ideas what the ground states could look like,

410
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,500
say, of the square, like this one that we're most

411
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,070
familiar with so far from the easy model work

412
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,630
lecture's?

413
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,080
Perhaps we could start answering that question by

414
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:55,760
speaking about what happen to the. Ground states,

415
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,890
in the case of positive that we just discussed, so

416
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:06,100
this is visible. Florida was big. So you now have

417
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:12,110
the energy. We say that is minus one to the value.

418
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,270
It is

419
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:22,000
almost ubiquitous. All the students on both sides

420
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,510
of the border, states that we saw in class for all

421
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:32,900
the spin's are alive. All these products, SJS, are

422
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,840
just plus minus one squared.

423
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:45,570
So that the energy is more than being. Negative.

424
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,290
Two times as good times, the number of sites is

425
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,960
the number of links to elections, which is

426
00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:00,410
possible to win. So a very large. Value for the

427
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:04,010
energy and in fact, the maximum possible energy

428
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,790
that we can have out of the sign of the

429
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,970
interaction term and the energy has been reversed.

430
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,950
So are there any states that. Could produce a

431
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,910
lower energy that us closer toward the ground

432
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:32,060
states. And it's not that. So if we. Will be here

433
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,850
once big problems come down. So rather than being

434
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,000
worried, whether it's the one that just pushed

435
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:43,240
aside there and brings energy down by two units,

436
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:48,130
it removes one unit from the positive amount and

437
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,350
the unit to the negative column.

438
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,880
Starting from this basis, we can essentially

439
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,220
generalize and say that we get a reduction of the

440
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,460
energy from having these two storms opposite to

441
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,700
each other, that a further reduction by having

442
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,700
spent considerable time there, comes along next to

443
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,500
it and similarly in the end. So there is a pattern

444
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:27,100
developing up and down since. That we can continue

445
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:31,840
in the other direction, so if that comes up, then

446
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,990
maybe that's then used as a negative contribution

447
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:39,250
to the energy from that link between them. So this

448
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,880
guy wants to be part of a negative contribution to

449
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,150
that one, as well as a negative contribution from

450
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,210
the vertical and so on last.

451
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:59,620
So that is. The overall structure of the ground

452
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:04,270
states for this case of a negative interaction

453
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:09,220
strikes on the simple tube ubiquitous. And in

454
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:15,640
terms of terminology, this is described as an anti

455
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,580
thermogenic.

456
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,310
Siskin.

457
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,040
Performs.

458
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:30,260
So the ferromagnetic is something we saw briefly

459
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,970
in the lecture. What's the motivation for let's

460
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,760
use them to consider developing this easy model?

461
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:41,450
Well. The material has a large and lasting

462
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:47,570
magnetic dipole, so the sphere of magnets become

463
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:50,360
magnets at low temperature when all of their

464
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,170
magnetic dipoles from the constituent molecules

465
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:58,790
align in the same direction so that aligned ground

466
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,760
states resolve for. Positive coupling both in

467
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,550
lecture and just now is called the fellow in the

468
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,890
States. This one where is a regular pattern of

469
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,130
Pantelion and particles corresponding to

470
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,120
interactions with the opposite side is a fancy

471
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:25,940
like system. So we can appreciate that overall

472
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,700
position, but there is. Regular array of

473
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,960
oppositely oriented particles is just going to be

474
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,700
exactly zero in this great state, which is the

475
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,730
same magnetization that we get at the high

476
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:46,810
temperature phase. But on the other hand, there is.

477
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:51,850
A certain amount of order in here that we at least

478
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,720
intuitively, would think that we could capture

479
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,680
with some order parameter.

480
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,280
With an eye on the time, I won't go into too many

481
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,280
details, but it is possible for this guy to define

482
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,600
quality as a stable.

483
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:18,860
Which is,

484
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,530
of course,

485
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:31,870
minus one to the end. I should sleep over here

486
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:39,400
over all these scandals, and so just sit down, as

487
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,210
we did for the organization summit that's been

488
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,350
going on with a factor of minus one to the end. So

489
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:51,270
that. The positive spin at site.

490
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,460
Zero plus one negative spin aside, one contributor

491
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,760
minus one plus minus one, plus one, and it all

492
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,960
adds up to the large non-zero value here. And it's

493
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,190
possible to relate this to the derivative of the

494
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,450
of the log of the free energy derivative, the

495
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,430
derivative of the free energy, which is the longer

496
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:18,520
the partition function. By adding an additional

497
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:24,710
standard extra field contribution to the success

498
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:30,240
that couples and this is an.

499
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,040
So that is, in fact, a bona fide order parameter

500
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:38,230
for an anti Semitic phase that distinguishes it

501
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:42,100
from both the high-temperature disordered phase as

502
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,220
well as the ferromagnetic phase for all the

503
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,690
students are aligned as the usual using model

504
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,040
we're looking at in lectures.

505
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:59,660
And the. I will just mention that essentially this

506
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:05,380
constitutes the opinion on this hexagonal, this

507
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,620
type of glass alternatives.

508
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:15,550
Up and down the street on all of these various

509
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,150
neighbors.

510
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:24,030
I don't know. Well, here this guy is, that would

511
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,160
be consistent alternating pattern that also has

512
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:36,250
that non-zero of magnetization. The Funchess is

513
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,840
the triangle, the

514
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:41,610
OR.

515
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,280
Put it here, we just look at a single cell of that,

516
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,000
trying to relax and we say one of those kids is

517
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,780
going up. We've seen that to get a negative

518
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,980
contribution to the energy of the ground states.

519
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,090
We want. All of its neighbors to be walking down

520
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:08,320
the opposite direction so that the energy with

521
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:14,820
less than zero is itself turned out, so it was

522
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:19,570
more expensive to do that. Now, this pair of

523
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,150
nearest neighbors is kicking a positive

524
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:26,110
contribution to the energy rather than the

525
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,820
negative contribution that we want from all of

526
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,540
these things in order to minimize the energy.

527
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:39,000
In this case, we're just this simple cell of three

528
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:42,930
students trying to integration, you can prove this

529
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,720
is the best you can do. There are six possible

530
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,750
orientations of two students in one direction and

531
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:54,360
one the other that are the lowest that. You can go

532
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,080
to the antigrowth and the case, things that can

533
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:04,740
help you start to feel that this. System from the

534
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,290
one you have to sell out to

535
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,350
for less with some large number of students. We

536
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:18,150
start seeing all sorts of flashes. Want this to be

537
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:23,760
obvious that there's a clash with that? It's to

538
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:26,740
have this up, so that's contributions for those

539
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,870
two links now we

540
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,450
know it's going to have one of the other two.

541
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:39,330
It's a mirror image of the.

542
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:48,330
So this situation is very strange in

543
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,800
that it easy model is trying to the latest is

544
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,100
known as a frustrated anti-hero. And that's where

545
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,760
the connect briefly with a bit of theoretical

546
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,970
computer science question of finding the ground

547
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,680
state for a given number of sites is not possible.

548
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,780
To compute in a polynomial amount of time with a

549
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:20,710
polynomial is in the number of sites that you have.

550
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:24,820
If you add another site to the system, finding the

551
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:28,060
microstates, minimum energy takes exponentially

552
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:35,060
more time than the smaller system. So if you're

553
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,410
given the ground state, you can check. That is

554
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:43,950
energy is small pretty quickly. So the question of

555
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:48,440
finding the ground states is known as has been the

556
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:52,980
key calculation here that stands for non

557
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:57,150
polynomial and abstract computer science

558
00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:00,540
determinations, that means that it takes

559
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,300
exponentially longer to find the solution. But

560
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:06,690
once you have a solution, check it quickly. And

561
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,630
this question here, the. Frustrated easing into

562
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,150
heroin is

563
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:20,730
a huge problem without going into details, you can

564
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:23,640
think of that, say the other, exponentially higher

565
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,120
computational problems can be mapped into this

566
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,150
sort of system. That's a riverside.

567
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:39,270
The conceptual the qualitative aspects of the

568
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,700
housing bubble on different land structures

569
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,290
obviously running out of time much more quickly

570
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:49,920
than I anticipated. Going to just wrap up by

571
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,640
posing what? Narrowly avoided being one of the.

572
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,560
Questions on the homework assignment, which is

573
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:02,800
motivated by physics. There were spin classes,

574
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,380
which I don't really have time to talk about today,

575
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,170
but we might get back to you later on over the

576
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,860
next week or two. If time permits, then there's a

577
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,230
further generalization. The is immoral to

578
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:21,940
couplings that can vary on different levels. How

579
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,350
does indeed have practical application in a lot of

580
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,980
experiments, which is how you receive a Nobel

581
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:34,450
Prize that 10 months ago have to really work on

582
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:37,330
this in the case of let's call a fully connected

583
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,050
lattice

584
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,020
rather than. Now, the.

585
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,100
Some say it's been years and years of others and

586
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,420
some slightly further away from the connected case,

587
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:54,270
sometimes called the complete graph, every side of

588
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,900
the. This is a neighbor of every other side. So

589
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:01,480
that's illustrated here, going from there, trying

590
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:07,790
to sell. Up to systems with four, eight or 12

591
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:11,570
sites and a number of links that increases, like

592
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:18,850
the binomial coefficients of engines to. So as a.

593
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:25,200
Phone conversation that you can do on this fully

594
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,040
connected Latisse email. Her off to at least part

595
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,630
of the. Until next week can simplify things by

596
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:40,310
going back to a constant interaction strength. And

597
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:45,030
trying to compute the procreation function. For

598
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:49,350
the energy given by the same sort of using

599
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:54,170
Hamiltonian where now? Somebody go to the nearest

600
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:57,530
neighbors need something over all pairs of sides

601
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:01,520
of the lattice, so just in case with the

602
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,330
interaction strength that decreases as the number

603
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:09,260
of size increases so that the energy parasite's.

604
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:13,730
Our interview per spin remains five times as it

605
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:17,870
increases, so sorry you didn't get a chance to

606
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:20,630
start playing with that this afternoon, but it's

607
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:24,350
something that you think about the weekly column

608
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:29,570
and siblings below there that I'll skip over about.

609
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:34,710
The productive way to approach this by

610
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,640
reorganizing the problem in terms of possible

611
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:44,600
values of magnetization, so. That is all the time

612
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,650
we have this afternoon off until Tuesday morning.

613
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,600
Don, as always, feel free to get in touch if any

614
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,800
questions come up about this or indeed anything

615
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,130
else.

616
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:05,920
What

617
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,110
was that?
