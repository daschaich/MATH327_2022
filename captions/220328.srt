00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:12,460
All right, let's get things underway this afternoon. Hopefully the jackhammer outside

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,570
is not going to cause any problems for us.  It

3
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,660
seems far enough away that it's just a bit of

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:25,550
background noise. So, welcome to the final stretch

5
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:31,970
before the break.  The plan for this week, just

6
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:37,370
looking at where we are in the topics for the module, is

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,500
going to be to wrap up those quantum gases in the

8
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,080
grand-canonical ensemble, but hold off on getting into

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,500
the next and final big section of the module,

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,130
which is introducing interactions to the

11
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,520
statistical systems we consider. I think we'd

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,540
probably have time to start talking about that

13
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,140
later this week, but then after the break, we

14
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,350
would have to circle back and resume all of that

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,240
from the start to catch back up. So probably good to

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,910
put a bit of a break in the material as well as

17
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:24,890
just in the meetings. So what we are doing today, on

18
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,980
the twenty eighth

19
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,060
of March, is, first of all, checking to see if

20
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,210
there are any immediate questions about what we

21
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,550
were doing last week.

22
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,210
We dealt with the photon gas, the quantum gas of

23
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,410
Marcellus unprivileged, this seclusions.

24
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,960
Particularly.

25
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,880
Finisterre, the so-called radiation pressure that

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,210
even particles of light exerts on any containers

27
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:15,370
that contain them, and this gave us the equation

28
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,350
of state for the first time, gas, which are the

29
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,580
usual form that radiation pressure times. The

30
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,470
volume depends on the number of particles. The

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,560
temperature is like the ideal gas law with just a.

32
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,590
Numerical factor of the rebounds is a function

33
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,500
with argument four divided by that, we must see

34
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,940
the function of three coming in from the quantum

35
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,840
statistics of those Einstein counting the. Stuff

36
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:56,730
food arrived back in Unit seven, and I don't think

37
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:03,390
I emphasized enough last week that this expression,

38
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:10,740
which is PI squared over 90, Zyda three, is not

39
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,300
that far from one. So in practice, it is not easy

40
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,000
to distinguish the equation of state for a gas of

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,060
mass photons compared to the classical equation of

42
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,370
the state that was started to be established

43
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,250
empirically back in the sixteen hundreds Boyle's

44
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,520
law and was put on the framework of statistical

45
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,220
physics even in the mid eighteen hundreds well

46
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:38,790
before.

47
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:46,440
The. Connection between photons and radiation was

48
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,380
developed following quantum statistics and ideas

49
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,150
of those kinds of programs, and we're actually

50
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,200
part of the fourth. Sorry about that. Kind of

51
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,060
looking at this, we can just do a bit of mental

52
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,560
arithmetic that PI squared is 10 PI being a bit

53
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,180
more than three years apart. The fourth is about

54
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,690
one hundred. Zyda three. Something like one point

55
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,490
two to it's a famous irrational number, so 90

56
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,640
times more, that one also gives us something

57
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,530
around one hundred. And altogether this comes out

58
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,150
being that point nine times. And if you actually

59
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,390
put that into a calculator. And the precise value

60
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,590
so after. Wrapping up that the derivation of the

61
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,890
equation of state for the photon gas in three

62
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,610
dimensions, we turned to quantum gases at four

63
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,680
rounds and here we change looking at non

64
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,370
relativistic fermions, which is fermions that are

65
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,910
massive and huge. Mass is large compared to the

66
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,300
typical momentum of the energy are given by. The

67
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,890
classical relationship screwed over to AM derived

68
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,310
from the general Einstein triangle, the

69
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,850
combination of mass energy and kinetic energy. And

70
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,360
we also saw how all of the free energy levels are

71
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,430
degenerate from up and down spined states, at

72
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,240
least for a typical fermions like Electron's.

73
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,660
So a similar degeneracy to the full time and

74
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,540
tutorial attriting, but from very different

75
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,800
physics spin rather than pauperisation, and we

76
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,370
started working through derivations of the

77
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,300
particle, no density for fermions. So the average

78
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,500
number of particles and approach per unit volume.

79
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,020
That we found that we described as an integral

80
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,650
over the from the energies of this Fairmead

81
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,250
function.

82
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,690
I've left the cost of proportionality here, that's

83
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,150
in the notes, but the important thing for the time

84
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:24,290
being is. The. Similarity between the security

85
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:30,170
function and the average occupation that we looked

86
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,620
at to compare and contrast those instances, just

87
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,560
experiment with sticks and classical maps or

88
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,940
bowsman statistics. So which if we. To go back to

89
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,500
what I had on here is you. Test the focus for

90
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,200
today, you can see that as the temperature

91
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,520
decreases, that family function becomes closer and

92
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:59,410
approaches more closely, just a step function that

93
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,610
corresponds to.

94
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,110
Essentially, the probability of a level being

95
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,950
filled at low temperatures, that probability

96
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,220
becomes one for energy levels that have value to

97
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,000
the energy less than the positive chemical

98
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,270
potential that will come back around to today. And

99
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,060
once the energy becomes larger than that chemical

100
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,740
potential probability of a corresponding energy

101
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,430
level playing field crashes down quickly to zero.

102
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,570
So.

103
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,830
If we focus on that, the low temperature regime,

104
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,820
to simplify our calculations, at least for the

105
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,230
first pass through, then the simplest thing we can

106
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,980
do is approximates the security function just as

107
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,580
that step function, which is exact in the zero

108
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,480
temperature limit of absolute zero. And it's very

109
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,620
simple as these intervals quite dramatically.

110
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:14,950
That's still visible in. On what it does is cut

111
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:20,860
off the integral at the energy equal to the

112
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,850
chemical potential.

113
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,410
So that all of that exponential dependence that is

114
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,880
present at zero temperatures drops out and we just

115
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,710
end up with something directly proportional to the

116
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,950
power, three 1/2. So that's what we wrapped up

117
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,620
last week because of questions about.

118
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,420
This is the state of this calculation before we go

119
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,000
on to discuss a bit about what it means.

120
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,250
In terms of the media, I want to highlight the

121
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,360
dimension of dependence on the three halves power

122
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,010
of the chemical potential.

123
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,370
Since waking up at the top of this next page.

124
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,190
As well as, again, at the level of dimensional

125
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,630
analysis, independence from the temperature, at

126
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,650
least at low temperature, so we can appreciate the

127
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,840
temperature independence pretty easily just by

128
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,560
saying that this is a really good approximation to

129
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,670
a more general general result that could be

130
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,690
organized in the powers of that small temperature.

131
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,720
That is something you will have time to look at

132
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,720
and a bit more detail than originally planned

133
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,410
before the term break sets in at the end of this

134
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:56,790
week.

135
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,060
But independence of temperature is essentially an

136
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,050
approximation that we are making to this result by

137
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,680
placing that farming function with a simple step

138
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,040
function, the. Power of the chemical potential use

139
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,920
of the three hands. Is now governing the behavior

140
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,290
of this average density, so the average number of

141
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,880
particles is dependent on the chemical potential

142
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:39,200
and in such a way that. Can be appreciated from

143
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,630
dimensional analysis or from a more geometric. But

144
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,910
you're looking at things which gets to the.

145
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,110
Attempting to not quite succeed in draw on the

146
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,500
board

147
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,670
last week. And speaking of drawing on the board, I

148
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,950
realize I put on your six digit number for today.

149
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:11,810
So sorry that that is five seven zero.

150
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,370
So

151
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,980
we decide to fill in that blank

152
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:29,440
what we can think of at low temperatures just.

153
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,210
Is it not working?

154
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,130
Looking for something? When I reported some

155
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,760
problems earlier on, the generic advice was I saw

156
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,500
recently that we could see more trouble. That's

157
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,030
the level we're working at. It's not a crucial

158
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:55,220
issue for today. So getting back to the.

159
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,440
Dependents of the average, the density on this

160
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,670
three have power of the chemical potential. What

161
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,460
we can think of to motivate this, at least at low

162
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:14,360
temperatures, is a picture qualitative idea that

163
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,730
the step function approximation that we've used is

164
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,600
corresponding to the probability of energy levels

165
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,410
being empty or filled. So every energy level that

166
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,120
has a value of the energy is smaller than the

167
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,060
chemical potential is filled every one that has. A

168
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,070
energy larger than the chemical potential is empty,

169
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,760
so there is a cut off on the values of the energy

170
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,370
below, which all of the energy levels are sealed

171
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,510
and above, which all of those are all empty. So

172
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:56,580
the picture that I tried to draw on the board last

173
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,920
week with limited success is now replaced by this

174
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,270
printout I got from Dan Schroder's textbook

175
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,550
introduction to thermophilic. Several other

176
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,120
figures from there have also popped up and sugar

177
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,130
is using slightly different location. All these

178
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:20,800
names are the integer case that we have. What is

179
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,050
showing here are energy levels that depend on the

180
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,260
overall magnitude of that three vector case, X

181
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,960
squared squared plus case squared with the overall

182
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,180
chance that some of these energy levels depend on

183
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,510
the electrical energy, some constant.

184
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,580
Since when we looked at the possible of generous

185
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:58,300
use of those energy levels maybe a couple of weeks

186
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,270
ago now, the very start of this relatively long

187
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,370
date, each of the dots in this figure are those

188
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,270
possible energy levels, three vectors in tax. And

189
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:17,030
why is that? And the corresponding energy is given

190
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:23,740
by. The. Magnitude of the distance of the dot from

191
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,110
the origin, and by replacing or approximating the

192
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:36,760
integer X, Y, Z by real continuous has been to

193
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,060
simplify the calculations and integrals rather

194
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,970
than complicated sums. What we're doing is

195
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,560
approximating these cubes of discrete integer

196
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,170
points in this case based by the positive octaves

197
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:00,120
of the sphere that has this radius, payback's.

198
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:02,980
Remembering that.

199
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,140
The possible numbers of degrees of freedom and

200
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,440
values for today that we have in a typical

201
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,630
statistical physics system are something of order.

202
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,670
Ten to twenty three. If you do this exercise for

203
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,480
ten of the twenty three points filling up a cube,

204
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,490
you can convince yourself to take my word for it,

205
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,510
that the sort of rough bits around the edges of

206
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,360
this approximation where the sphere in Cuba are

207
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,590
not quite matching up are thoroughly irrelevant

208
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,270
compared to the overall volume of that cube. So

209
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,920
all of the energy levels that are picked out by

210
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,790
the step function are those that fit within that

211
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,490
tube. So they are

212
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,410
essentially filling the void, the volume of that

213
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:08,250
cube or the sphere with this particular radius

214
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:15,040
Cmax that is being set by the cutoff point in this

215
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,300
step function where E is

216
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:28,220
equal to. And since the idea is given by E

217
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,700
corresponds to where the overall value of Cmax is

218
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,230
like the square root of the energy. And then we

219
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,360
have again this cutoff point for the energy. You

220
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:47,380
pick up a sphere. We are counting over the field

221
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,240
energy levels within the volume of the positive

222
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:59,070
octave of a sphere with radius Cmax. Which is like

223
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,770
the square root of energy, which goes like the

224
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,970
square root of new volume of the sphere, is the

225
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,410
cube of its radius, giving us free powers of the

226
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,650
square root of MU or use of the three has this

227
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:21,900
functional dependence and hopefully the focus on

228
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,780
this camera will improve as I zoom back in.

229
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,530
You dealt with.

230
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,320
Stinking. Hopefully that's better, so that's the

231
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,200
kind of.

232
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,550
Dimensional analysis based arguments, you can

233
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,350
figure out the functional dependence of these

234
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,920
various quantities on the critical parameters,

235
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,550
temperature and chemical potential, just from some

236
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:02,120
considerations of the meaning of the

237
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,550
approximations that we're making in terms of what

238
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,660
this family function is and what it means, what it

239
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:17,660
amounts to when we talk about it as a step up. So

240
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:23,860
hopefully that discussion is not too confusing and

241
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,590
immediate questions about.

242
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,430
Not hearing any what we can do on the basis of

243
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,330
this argument is actually invert the result that

244
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,260
we found for that critical density. The average

245
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,170
number of particles divided by volume and extract

246
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,950
the corresponding energy that.

247
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,870
Matches up to the.

248
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:01,370
Square root of the radius of that sphere that we

249
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,780
were just looking at. So rather than talk about

250
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,020
how many particles or what particle density we

251
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,870
have to give, the kind of potential we can

252
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,860
consider, if we have a gas with gas, a fermions

253
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,100
with some particle density, what is the

254
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,530
corresponding chemical essential, which is use of

255
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:29,640
energy that corresponds to the. The region must

256
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,410
see the energy space that would be filled by that

257
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,270
density of particles. This value for the chemical

258
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:44,730
potential is known as the fairy energy at zero

259
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,670
temperatures. It is just the chemical potential

260
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,360
and at non-zero temperatures, we will see. Not

261
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,530
today, but later on this week. There are small

262
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,310
corrections that come into the terminology, but

263
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,030
this is essentially is the.

264
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:09,040
Shape of the region in the space of momentum and

265
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,250
all of these terminals are trying to fill at low

266
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,100
temperatures and they don't have a large amount of

267
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,400
thermal energy or equivalently, with all higher

268
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,780
energy, energy levels are exponentially suppressed

269
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,280
by that function and every transit systems that we

270
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,090
have derived.

271
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:31,910
So.

272
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,310
I'll just say in passing that. In the case of

273
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,580
these not interacting, yes, in civil war, that's

274
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,760
sort of the simple case for the of energy. The

275
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,190
ferry surface, as it's called, is just the sphere

276
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,590
of the sphere, and once we get into if we were to

277
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,530
get into more complicated gases, it firming up,

278
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,510
for instance, electrons and various sorts of

279
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,790
metals, we talk about what it does talk about and

280
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,580
watch those through the shape of their so-called

281
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,730
pheromone surface. No longer just a year with a

282
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:15,290
particular radius, but a more complicated object,

283
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,820
the behavior of which we can tell you a great deal

284
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,450
about the behavior of the corresponding the

285
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,900
without having to go through detailed calculations.

286
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,850
That's not even for this modulars they will peak

287
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:36,700
at. How these sorts of ideas play out in. Things

288
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,570
like material science and superconductivity and

289
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,960
investigations of crystals themselves.

290
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,350
Set that aside for now and having completed the

291
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,530
average particle density can go on to. If you're

292
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:59,850
the average energy. Was there are. Questions or

293
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,870
objections about.

294
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:11,520
What we've gone through so far. The. Only change

295
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,110
that we need to introduce to consider the average

296
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:20,040
internal energy density rather than the. Average

297
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,210
particle, no density is just an additional factor

298
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,050
of the energy in the same integral that we had

299
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:33,210
before. So. When we broke down, this had to go

300
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,680
with the cost factor multiplied by the integration

301
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,680
of that family function, the square root of the.

302
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,720
That was counting the number of particles that we

303
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,380
have in the energy levels that are available, the

304
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,240
every function essentially giving us the

305
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,890
probability that any given energy level with this

306
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,480
value of the energy will be occupied. Now, to get

307
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,880
the internal energy, we have to start over not

308
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,870
merely the number of occupied energy levels, but

309
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,370
also the amount of energy that they are

310
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,520
contributing to the overall gas. So.

311
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,810
That is the purpose of this extra factory coming

312
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:25,150
into. This next integral here whenever we have.

313
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,720
With some probability and occupy energy level

314
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:32,770
energy, it's contributing exactly that energy to

315
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,120
the overall average energy of our gas.

316
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:47,740
And with the low temperature approximation of that

317
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,130
primary function being the step function, this

318
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:57,440
integral is. Essentially just as easy to to

319
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,030
compute as that for the average protocol. We

320
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,670
started off with by reviewing today.

321
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:12,110
The constant increase factor comes on. For the

322
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:18,050
ride and the fairy function is one between ages of

323
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:22,010
zero, up to the chemical potential view and it is

324
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,430
zero for all, energy is larger than UCITS, if you

325
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,090
will. Just it just gets cut off at a maximum value

326
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:35,670
of the chemical potential. And. The integral of.

327
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:43,520
X2, the three halves, the X is. Just another.

328
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:50,500
Simple power function. So the to the firefighters

329
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:56,960
now divided by five halves and evaluated as equals

330
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:06,100
zero and equals. So we have now zero zero and new

331
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:12,400
to the five hands we can split up into. That same

332
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,500
view to the three House facts that are coming from

333
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,300
the volume of a sphere in energy space the states

334
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:25,250
are filling. So it's that same factor of two new

335
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,370
to the three horsepower.

336
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,240
Bring that one over half up to provide another

337
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,590
factor to get to the three heads, there's a five

338
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:45,600
left over with PI squared in each part cubed. And

339
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,930
then one additional factor of view that comes

340
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:53,380
along and. The reason for organizing things in

341
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:59,480
this way is that we can identify a constant factor

342
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,260
proportional to the average particle, no density.

343
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,670
So we have to.

344
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:12,640
The result that we had earlier, this three has

345
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:20,070
power to win you over three. I scored a five and a

346
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:26,020
three everything else. It's the same for. Firmly

347
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:32,020
on no density times, the additional factor of the

348
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,990
chemical potential.

349
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:39,810
Many campuses will cancel out because of the

350
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,950
policies that are now on both sides of this

351
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:45,830
equation and just end up with the situation, one

352
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:51,480
of three very simple relations between the average

353
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,150
particle number in the average, the energy.

354
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,630
If we were to find out that overall internal

355
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:05,410
energy by the particle number, what would just be

356
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:10,240
left is three fifths of the chemical potential,

357
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,200
which is that from the energy that we have just

358
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:21,930
defined. So if all of the fermions were occupying

359
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:26,400
energy levels at the boundary of this year, then I

360
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:30,300
do want to show that would correspond to energy

361
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,430
use of that very energy.

362
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:39,080
So of the boundary of the sphere, the energy is

363
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,340
just kind of the actual. And what we found is that

364
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,040
it was that low temperatures,

365
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:54,590
as we fill up that sphere, the average energy.

366
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,390
Coming from all of the particles, from what that

367
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,190
sphere is not all the way up to the feminine

368
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,090
energy, but a little more than halfway there on

369
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:07,780
average, which is, again, just coming from the

370
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,650
geometry.

371
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:13,710
The.

372
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,980
The geometry of the relations between energy and

373
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,720
momentum in the knowledge of Mr.. That we.

374
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,410
We are depending on the situation where these

375
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,720
multiple energy levels are restricted to have at

376
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,880
least one term, you probably should have said

377
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,200
earlier, given a reminder, that that restriction

378
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,270
is the key that needs things to fill up one energy

379
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,970
level after the next rather than all collapsing

380
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:49,430
down into the lowest energy level. The way that

381
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:55,640
Placidyl particles or exotic particles would. And

382
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,530
one. Important aspect of this equation, one of the

383
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:05,930
three temperatures is that, as we said earlier,

384
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,750
the average particle number is independent of the

385
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,630
temperature and there's no additional dependence

386
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,670
on the temperature coming in through this three

387
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:23,440
fifths of U. Factor. So the energy itself. Is

388
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,160
independent of the temperature and the positive,

389
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,810
even when that temperature is absolutely zero.

390
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:39,220
And even in the absence of interactions, we are

391
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,900
still considering its ideal gas of the track and

392
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,370
particles. So.

393
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:53,130
There is a behavior here for four males, that is.

394
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,940
Extremely different than classical particles or

395
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:03,010
gases of. All those islands, like little towns, we

396
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:08,030
consider, if you remember the. Expression be used

397
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:12,500
repeatedly when considering thermodynamic cycles

398
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,910
built on plastic about the masses we had in the

399
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,160
chemical and solvents relation between the

400
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,500
internal and the temperature equals three has

401
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,030
plenty to that. That temperature, absolute zero

402
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,490
energy of the system. Also vanish. This is also

403
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:37,220
the case. For the first time this year. Things are

404
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,180
a bit more complicated because in the grand

405
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,170
economic ensemble number of photons, there's also

406
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:49,610
varying with the temperature. And if we pull out

407
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:53,750
of the overall temperature, we had found that the

408
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,600
energy with the US is actually proportional to

409
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,290
temperature. The fourth power and varnishes even

410
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:04,460
more quickly as that temperature becomes very

411
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,650
small. And it's completely different for fermions.

412
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,720
We have a non-zero energy even in the limits of

413
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,510
absolute zero temperature, which is precisely

414
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:21,570
because. We have at least one me in each of these

415
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:27,720
energy levels. So organizing energy levels as as

416
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,670
we have labeling them with some integer labels.

417
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,740
Where the energy is always increasing as we go to

418
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,890
the values of this label, we can picture 30 year

419
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:47,440
olds selling their energy levels, starting from

420
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,830
the levels of the smallest energies that have the

421
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,750
least exponential suppression of that function.

422
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,680
The average occupation number and. Going up to

423
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,370
levels of higher and higher energies until they

424
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:08,500
fill that whole sphere downward by that very

425
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,400
energy is the tension.

426
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:19,780
So and that is independent of the temperature from

427
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,700
can't get any lower energies with all of the lower

428
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,140
energy levels already filled due to that post

429
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:32,010
principal. And this this is the contrast to

430
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:36,510
classical Masonic systems, which. Don't have to

431
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:42,000
worry about the occupation numbers for energy

432
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,540
levels preventing any more particles from moving

433
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,510
into that, they can just keep crashing down to the

434
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:52,800
lowest energy, but eventually varnishes. The

435
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,040
temperatures,

436
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:00,440
again, with. Exponentially suppressed

437
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,340
probabilities for any higher energy levels to be

438
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:04,970
occupied.

439
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:11,840
And I know I've been going on at some length about

440
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,990
that picture of. Fermions filling up energy levels

441
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,160
as a way of thinking about the behavior of these

442
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:26,120
gases, that low temperature. And that is because

443
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,300
it's very useful to. It's sort of intuitive

444
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,890
understanding beyond the formal mathematics of how

445
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:37,360
these systems are behaving and why we can see now

446
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,420
returning to a question that came up at the start

447
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,420
of our considerations last Friday, which is. Why

448
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,930
do we have the positive chemical potential in

449
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:52,650
these systems, whether on introducing the

450
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:57,420
chemicals actually six now holding our bodies in

451
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:02,880
general, negative on based on this definition and

452
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,830
the relation between the number of particles and

453
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:12,920
the entropy of the system? So just to briefly

454
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,960
recall that argument, which was a few weeks ago.

455
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:22,020
If we think of just a ordinary classical gas

456
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,680
without any of the. Any consideration or any

457
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,110
worries about public exclusion principles for

458
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,130
forming the input from pond mechanics, we argue

459
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,980
that as we increase the number of particles in

460
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,550
that system, we generically have ways of Organa

461
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,460
ordering. Those particles are organized within a

462
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,010
larger number of microstates, response to a larger.

463
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,650
And if you want to define the chemical potential

464
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,300
with the entropy fixed through this equation that

465
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,280
comes from generalized, some of the identity we

466
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:03,410
derived in unisex, you would need to decrease the

467
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:07,940
overall energy of that system, remove the number

468
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,400
of accessible microstates for those larger numbers

469
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,920
of particles to occupy. So in that way, the

470
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,890
increase in entropy from the larger number of

471
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:22,310
particles is compensated by a decrease in the

472
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:27,110
entropy from a smaller energy, and the overall

473
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,890
derivative is therefore negative, that energy has

474
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:35,000
to decrease the number of particles increases and

475
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,790
vice versa. That's how it works. Classically, we

476
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:41,480
went through that argument some time ago and

477
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,100
that's exactly what does not apply to fermions at

478
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,460
low temperatures because in that limit of absolute

479
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,940
zero. We are all of the families who have fallen

480
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,240
to the lowest energy levels and they can fill in

481
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:56,640
all the.

482
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,230
There is only a single microstates, not one.

483
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,640
They're all the energy levels up to the energy are

484
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,060
full of the energy levels with higher energies are

485
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:15,680
empty. And if we were to add particles, so

486
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,650
increasing the number of particles, we don't get

487
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:23,980
the classical increase in the entropy number of

488
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:28,330
ways of organizing these particles, we just. Push

489
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:32,020
up that energy a little bit more, but we still

490
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:36,310
have just that simple micro states where all the

491
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:40,270
new particles are filling the additional energy

492
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:44,170
bubbles up to be shifted to energy. So going back

493
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:49,410
to the general definition of the entropy. Several

494
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,980
microstates of probability of the system being a

495
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,670
democracy at times of that same ability to have a

496
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:01,030
single term in the sun, that is that has

497
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:06,370
probability one for the system to be in the single

498
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,270
part of the microstates. So we have one time

499
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,800
support of one, which is zero entropy.

500
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:17,660
Independence of how many particles we have in the

501
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,190
system,

502
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,230
but at the same time, because these additional

503
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:28,190
particles are considering adding have to pick up

504
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:32,810
the empty energy levels that are around that

505
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:36,260
fairly energy, each of these additional particles

506
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:39,650
is bringing in a positive contribution to the

507
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:45,290
energy. They're all landing, if you will, at the

508
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:50,190
edge of the former surface, the sphere in case

509
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:55,600
space. We add the particles just outside of it.

510
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,230
Push the sphere to make the bit larger to the

511
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,750
portion of the particles in each of these new

512
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,960
particles that are contributing approximately that

513
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:08,860
energy to the total energy, which is a positive

514
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,820
contribution, a positive contribution in the

515
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,090
particle number for the positive derivative here.

516
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,680
Unlike the classical case we considered earlier on.

517
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,740
So the.

518
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,620
The potential then becomes zero, and we may or may

519
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:33,760
not have enough time this week to go through the

520
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,650
demonstration of how the chemical potential

521
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,070
recovers, the expected classical behavior and the

522
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,910
high temperature limits. Where we get back to that

523
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,840
situation where we generically expect it to be a

524
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,470
negative.

525
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:58,310
Quantity in the classical analysis, that's.

526
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:04,260
Something will be pushing towards coming up to the

527
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:04,680
break.

528
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:12,410
So quick pause, 30 questions that have come up,

529
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,490
we're going through this justification for working

530
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,580
with positive chemical potentials.

531
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:27,560
Because at this point, we are in. The position to

532
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:32,510
complete the calculation of the equation of states

533
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,340
for this now Multiphasic from get us to the

534
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,670
relation between its large scale quantities that

535
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,870
governs its behavior. And the missing piece that

536
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:52,530
we need is, as usual, the pressure of this case.

537
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:58,100
So the response, the average internal energy to a

538
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,640
negative change in the volume, keeping the number

539
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,430
of particles fixed and also keeping the entropy

540
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:09,890
fixed. And we just went through an argument that

541
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,470
the entropy at least had this low temperature

542
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:16,490
limit is automatically fixed, it's just zero and

543
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:22,170
having only that one microstates. Available. So we

544
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:27,600
don't have to do anything special to impose the

545
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,410
conditions of entropy in this case, we just need

546
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,780
to plug in the.

547
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:39,640
Overall internal energy that we computed into this

548
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,540
derivative and. In particular, in serving the.

549
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:49,050
Average political number that we computed earlier

550
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,710
to get everything in terms of the volume.

551
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:59,130
So that is the expression that is it's written

552
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:03,450
here be slightly. We are inserting actually the.

553
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,520
Value of the chemical potential at the zero energy

554
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,810
limit in order to get things in terms of.

555
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,640
The volume, so.

556
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,740
Look back to this equation when no one really knew

557
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,700
was this was the definition of the of the energy

558
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,430
that it's your temperature matches the chemical

559
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:33,510
potential and obstacles optical three factors to

560
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,650
consider. The particle mass just brings in another

561
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,220
two thirds power of the average particle that

562
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:45,600
density and divided by five. So that's revealing

563
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,910
how the

564
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:55,700
average internal energy depends on the volume. And

565
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,430
adding that two thirds power of the protocol

566
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:04,620
number to the single tower, the part of the number

567
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:09,000
that we had in relation to the previous page is

568
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,960
three fifths times chemical potential times

569
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,390
average protocol. No end up with this dependence

570
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:20,430
upon that particular number two five thirds. So

571
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:24,690
keeping in and fixed.

572
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,420
All that happens when we take liberties with

573
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,710
respect to the volume.

574
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:42,170
Is that we pick up, so we have here lots of

575
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,470
constants and the functional dependency of the

576
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:49,070
minus two thirds power so that.

577
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:56,220
Two thirds negative, two thirds it comes down that

578
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:59,460
cancels out that negative sign that we had the

579
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,000
definition of the pressure. And then we reduce the

580
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,640
exposure to the volume by another factor, which

581
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,050
corresponds to dividing by the and then everything

582
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:15,610
else is just a constant that comes along for the

583
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:20,980
ride. Three fifths times squared over to him and

584
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:25,080
then this three pi squared with the remaining

585
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:29,640
factor of the two thirds and the average particle,

586
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:36,270
number two, the five others. We can rewrite in a

587
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:40,220
couple of interesting ways, so. Maybe the easiest

588
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,220
way is to recognize that this whole thing is the

589
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,060
energy taking, the derivative of so this is two

590
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,610
thirds times. The average internal energy

591
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:56,590
nanowires by an extra factor of the volume. So

592
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:03,890
pressure is directly proportional to the average

593
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:08,340
internal energy density and. Plugging in the other

594
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,040
relationship we had, the energy was three fifths

595
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,950
times the chemical potential, eight times the

596
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:20,400
particle number we can read this instead is three

597
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,260
is cancer and the five comes in the chemical

598
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:27,210
potential average number, number density.

599
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:35,030
Maybe the most interesting way of expressing this

600
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,700
is. But again. Inserting what we had for that

601
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,010
chemical potential, that the zero temperature for

602
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,140
energy in terms of that same. Particle, no density.

603
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,150
Which is.

604
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,290
From that equation, one to once again.

605
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,330
Just look at it quickly here, that picture of each

606
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:13,350
person to end times in three pi squared to the two

607
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:18,180
thirds power, so the two cancel each square mile

608
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:26,010
over five, and we have three pi squared to two

609
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:32,010
thirds power. And a two thirds power of it will be

610
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,270
multiplied by this additional power. And it will

611
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:43,440
be so. Particle, no density now to be five thirds

612
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,250
power, that is. A useful way of.

613
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:58,480
Getting things precisely because an. Recognize

614
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:03,730
this average particle, no density as well, just a

615
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:10,030
density, we can take that to be the relevant

616
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:15,400
parameter in this expression. So that the pressure

617
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:19,390
of the gas.

618
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:25,300
Is just directly proportional to the density of

619
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,210
the five thirds power multiplied by some

620
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:33,580
complicated calcium factor, depending on the mass

621
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:39,540
of this particle. And again, like the energy there

622
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:46,530
is. The new and exciting behavior for the pressure

623
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:52,650
that we still have a positive pressure, even in

624
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:56,070
the limit of absolute zero temperature, again, to

625
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:02,670
be a contrast to. The classical ideal gas photon

626
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:07,240
gas that we had for prosodic particles. And this

627
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,570
pressure, even though there is a pressure, it's

628
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:16,140
not related to any force between these fermions.

629
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:20,790
It's coming from that exclusion principle. If you

630
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:25,140
owed. Symmetric or anti symmetric functions

631
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:30,150
describing these fermions. So it's that purely

632
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:33,840
quantum effect arising from the public exclusion

633
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,460
principle that leaves this temperature independent

634
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:43,840
contribution to the pressure. Now. Wrap up just by

635
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:50,100
looking at. This figure here, which is combining

636
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:52,710
the two limits that we've considered so far,

637
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:59,580
recognizing that high temperatures, we recover

638
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,500
classical physics, so we should recover precisely

639
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,770
that ideal gas law with no additional pre factors,

640
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:14,710
PV equals. And team for introducing the same

641
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:17,860
density in terms of the particle number divided by

642
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:22,120
volume and pressure that is linearly dependent

643
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:28,060
upon temperature. So as the temperature is large,

644
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:33,180
which is. The right hand side of this plant, we

645
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:39,040
have just a straight line. Olivia Dependent's in

646
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,210
the pressure as you go to the classical machine

647
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,340
and then at low temperatures approaching the zero,

648
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,810
we enter the quantum regime where the quantum

649
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,270
statistics of these fermions.

650
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:58,630
Comes into play and reveals itself by the

651
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:03,280
temperature no longer varying at all, with the

652
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,690
pressure no longer growing at all with the

653
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:08,950
temperature, but rather approaching this constant.

654
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,140
Zero temperature limit for the pressure that you

655
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:20,880
will see more about tomorrow morning and see how

656
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,560
this plays a role in the physical systems.

657
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:35,910
So we'll wrap up there for today in the last sort

658
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:38,310
of rush through this last bit about the two

659
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:41,310
minutes. The pressure will pick up there again

660
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:44,520
tomorrow morning. So we have a break overnight to

661
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:47,400
think about whether the calculations that we have

662
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,330
done and the way to interpret them makes sense.

663
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:57,570
And from this point tomorrow, we will apply this

664
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:04,770
behavior of the nation states to some interesting

665
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:05,930
physical phenomena.

666
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:10,390
To see all that.

667
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:16,430
And

668
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:20,460
with.

669
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:27,920
Just.
