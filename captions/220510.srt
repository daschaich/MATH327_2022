1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,000
All right, let's get going just a couple minutes

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,420
late while I tried to set up some stuff for later

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,890
today. We'll get back to that when the time comes.

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,810
We can also see how the projector does with the bright

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:27,720
sunlight coming in as we zoom in to better fill the

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,970
screen.  And, before I forget, let's deal with six-digit code,

7
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:43,000
which for this morning is one zero, nine nine, zero two.

8
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,590
And unless there are immediate questions we can

9
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,140
pick up pretty much exactly where we left off at

10
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:02,670
the end of yesterday.  Having gone through the second

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,590
analytical calculation for a simple case of the

12
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,370
Ising model in a small number of dimensions.  So

13
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,460
comparing the two-dimensional case that we worked

14
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,100
on yesterday to the one-dimensional case that we

15
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,450
were able to solve exactly last Friday. We could

16
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,230
see that key, key difference between them and the

17
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,410
three key steps that we had to go through were

18
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,060
leading the. Independent Degrees of freedom, these

19
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,800
films that live on the site with the interactions

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,290
that they have that are associated with the links,

21
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,350
and this reveals why things are so sensitive to

22
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,620
the dimensionality of the system, because as the

23
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,040
number of dimensions increases each side, each

24
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,890
degree of freedom is connected to a greater number

25
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,920
of links. So it interacts with more and more of

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,980
its neighbors. Eventually, that whole infinite

27
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,380
dimension of limited approaches, the fully

28
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,140
connected lattice, the complete graph and play

29
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,700
with a bit in last Friday's tutorial. So. In one

30
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,020
dimension, there's an equal number of sites in

31
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,740
Lagos, and we were able to recast the sum of all

32
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,590
of those interaction terms as a sum over. The

33
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,230
states themselves taking into account the

34
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,380
constraints that were brought in to make sure that.

35
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,550
But the one each particular spin was interacting

36
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,090
with its two nearest neighbors, it was adopting a

37
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,910
self-consistent value that was imposed just by

38
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,790
recasting things in terms of matrix multiplication.

39
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,490
And that is insufficient itself in two dimensions,

40
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,210
where instead we took a more roundabout route. We

41
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,180
did not get an exact analytics emotional that

42
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,720
exists. We proceeded by swapping out. The

43
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,680
configuration, some over those degrees of freedom,

44
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,930
the skins for a different sum over all possible

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,290
interactions between them. Those links being

46
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,580
either on or off and then work backwards by

47
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,150
identifying the strengths that the links that

48
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,030
result, there had to be even number of links

49
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,300
turned on at each site that we could relate them

50
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,790
to interactions between dual spins located on the

51
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,710
two Allardice. In the case of the simple square

52
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,350
lattice in two dimensions, its dual lattice, it's

53
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,380
just another square that has shifted so that its

54
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,750
sites in the center of focus and the end result of

55
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,110
all those manipulations was essentially this

56
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,140
expression which reproduced our. Target for a

57
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,640
certain goal and that we have the original

58
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,630
petition function. That depends on the temperature

59
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,710
data. Being identified with a new production

60
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,980
function for that same two dimensional using

61
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,520
system.

62
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,690
Depending on the dual and temperature to tell them

63
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:27,510
that we. To. Define, see or identify with a

64
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,930
particular value of the original data, along with

65
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,900
a bit dependent factor that is independent of the

66
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,210
other, the spins or the dual spins. And the

67
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,170
relation between these dual inversed temperatures

68
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,840
that had been held up can be cast in a few

69
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,810
different ways and the debate is held, is that

70
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,990
negative? Half more attention paid off? Or as we

71
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,550
turn through some type of trigonometric identities,

72
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,910
we saw that there is this inverse relation that

73
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,770
the hyperbolic sign of twice the do obeida is the

74
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,870
inverse of the sign of itself. So if we were to

75
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:21,320
plot the corresponding values to say how this

76
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,990
General David Shelbie depends on like given a

77
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,860
percentage or better, whenever data is large and

78
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,050
that synch becomes exponentially large, the

79
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,650
denominator towards the fraction itself. So we end

80
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,310
up with much more value for Telma and vice versa.

81
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,830
Small data, one over a small number gives us this

82
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,700
large number of inverse relationship like so

83
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,780
swapping out. The high and low temperatures in the

84
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,400
original system and its dual.

85
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,380
So. Before commenting further on that weekend. Do

86
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,890
some similar manipulations to this constant

87
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,090
prefectly that we have out here. A factor of a

88
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,210
half coming from the dual spins, double counting

89
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,030
all possible configurations of links turned on or

90
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,560
off, and then these trigonometric factors and

91
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,450
powers of twice cost me the simulator, which we

92
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,600
worked out. Yesterday, the double identity, that

93
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,090
is just the synch of two data, and we've now

94
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,200
derived that the essential to data is the inverse

95
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:53,560
of the sense of the dual two data. Tilde, or we

96
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,760
can. Pull out a factor of one over hyperbolic

97
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,640
cosine from this product and identify. It is

98
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,470
hyperbolic, cosine squared times it Hansch, which

99
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,240
is useful because we earlier saw that the

100
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,540
intention of BeÃ¡ta is an exponential factor in

101
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,260
terms of the dual inverse temperature and plugging

102
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,950
in this ratio and rearranging gets us back to the

103
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,560
way that we framed this duality.

104
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,880
To start off this section yesterday. That's able

105
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,130
to isolate all the dependence on the inverse

106
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,590
temperature or its dual on either side of this

107
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:49,020
equation. So this has reproduced what we initially

108
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,010
stated as our goal, and now we can just wrap up

109
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,220
this whole unit on interactive systems with some

110
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,040
comments on what this really means, having gone

111
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,120
through the exercise, for one thing, we don't

112
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,200
really have to care too much about these people in

113
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,450
the field, independent counsel factors that come

114
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,100
along for the. Now, multiply the petition

115
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,920
functions, so it's not too hard to show that if we

116
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:25,010
multiply a petition function by a factor that does

117
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,460
not depend on its microscopic degrees of freedom,

118
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,290
it does not depend on the individual microstates,

119
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,900
but legal control parameters such as the

120
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,920
temperature that drops out of all of the

121
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,090
expectation values that we can actually observe

122
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,000
when analyzing these systems. That is an exercise

123
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,250
I will leave for you to play with rather than

124
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:56,270
going through here myself. So what we have for

125
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,780
money do we can ignore those three factors and

126
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,470
just say that the systems themselves, this is set

127
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,920
up better instead of being tell up are equivalent

128
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,990
four pairs of. Temperatures in their Dools satisfy

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,220
this relation. High temperatures are meant to cool

130
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,610
ones or lower ones and lower temperatures, not to

131
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,880
high temperatures. Now, this can be subtle because

132
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,560
it does not mean that the two dimensional using

133
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,210
model we've been considering is the same at high

134
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,080
temperatures. What's really going on is that two

135
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,930
different using models in terms of two different

136
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,080
sets of degrees of freedom are being identified by

137
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,890
this duality.

138
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,600
And we've seen that the. And each one of these

139
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,360
using models is going to be distinct, different

140
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,150
phases at high temperatures. That's where we

141
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,440
started off with our analysis of this is a

142
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,240
charismatic interacting system. A couple of weeks

143
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,530
ago where. The high and low temperature phases of

144
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,710
each of these easy models are qualitatively

145
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,540
distinct and in the high temperature.

146
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,980
If we consider the low temperature forward, phase

147
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,300
four, seven years experience, we know that at

148
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,520
least more than what dimension are largely aligned,

149
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,110
producing a non-zero value of the order parameter,

150
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:36,150
the magnetization. And this order phase is mapped

151
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,720
by Kramers Wanita duality onto. A disordered phase

152
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,180
of the dual spins rather than the disordered phase

153
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,990
of the space itself. So we can formulate this one

154
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,010
phase in terms of a different parameter, sometimes

155
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,210
called the disorder parameter and.

156
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,400
More guys are in the low temperature phase of the

157
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,740
original system with the high temperature phase of

158
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,340
the dual system, which can. Or vice versa, which

159
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:16,150
can simplify calculations in situations where one

160
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,900
or the other of those phrases might be easier to

161
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,680
work with. That's the general power of duality.

162
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,330
That's in some situations the dual system may be

163
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:31,210
easier to work with than the original system. Now,

164
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,650
the two dimensional using model linear new

165
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,290
developments special in a few ways, one of which

166
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:42,830
being that the dual system is just another version

167
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,280
or another iteration of the system that we started

168
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,360
off with using model is mapped by this duality to

169
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,220
another using model.

170
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,390
With a different set of double spins and this is

171
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,620
in general not the case.

172
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,270
But because it occurs further to the easy model,

173
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,080
we can learn one very interesting thing from

174
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,150
Kramer's Monia duality, which is what? Happens

175
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,420
when those two phases, the high temperature

176
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,840
behaviors that are ordered or disorder can come

177
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:28,060
inside if we set the inverse temperature equal to

178
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:34,360
its dual. So that the systems are being mapped

179
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,210
directly onto each other rather than from one

180
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:42,060
phase to the other phase. This is the only

181
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,940
possible inverse temperature at which a phase

182
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,820
transition could possibly appear. The interface

183
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,240
between those high and low temperature phases.

184
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,310
And it turns out that this relationship equals

185
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,700
Matilda has a solution, we recall that.

186
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,600
Derived.

187
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:13,200
The inverse relation between the hyperbolic signs

188
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,100
of being invaded, Hilda, so setting data equal to

189
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,560
be to tell that just means that the square of the

190
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,450
sense of the twice this critical inverse

191
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,200
temperature has to be equal to one or the critical

192
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,370
data itself is just one 1/2 times the inverse

193
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:38,110
synch for the arc of one. Which is related to a

194
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,580
logarithm of one four through, two through. A

195
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,410
fairly standard identity for that inverses. Which

196
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,850
is similar to the. Our identity that we

197
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,090
encountered and working with the fully connected

198
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:01,100
virus in the tutorial on Friday. And this then is

199
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,950
just a number, a prediction for the exact value

200
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,470
that is approximately four point four for.

201
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,070
Corresponding to the critical temperature itself

202
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:15,810
won over the sea of about two point two seven also

203
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:20,040
known. Exactly. So this result historically was

204
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,460
derived in nineteen forty one. I was involved in

205
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,170
it and it was in nineteen forty four, three years

206
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,240
later when Einziger managed to produce an exact

207
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,420
solution for the two dimensional using model

208
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,380
beyond the scope of what we are able to cover here

209
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,930
and in the exact solution that if found, the

210
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,280
correct reproduction of this exact critical

211
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,230
temperature was. And strong early piece of

212
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,080
evidence that the solution, very difficult

213
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,410
calculation, was, in fact correct.

214
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,860
And since the nineteen forties duality to have

215
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,650
played a greater, greater role in theoretical

216
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:15,930
physics. And in general, the duality is that are

217
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,410
a centerpiece of modern ongoing research on a lot

218
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,100
more complicated than of individuality. This is

219
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,020
one of the simple early cases that started off

220
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,840
with field is not the final word. And I've already

221
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,870
mentioned that Creamer's one of the duality is

222
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,770
special in that the original system, the two

223
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,220
dimensional using model, is mapped by this duality

224
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,850
onto another two dimensional using models of dual

225
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:53,250
degrees of freedom. Are the same type of variable

226
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,580
these two state spends, plus or minus one Atabay,

227
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,430
the same interactions with those nearest neighbor

228
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,390
couplings that define the U.S. model. And this is

229
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,650
very special and unusual in terms of duality. So

230
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:13,540
if we were to. Repeat the attempt to repeat the

231
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,030
work that we did yesterday and the three

232
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,890
dimensional case where there are six. Links

233
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,550
attached to each site. Things would want go

234
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,940
through until we got back to depression, some over

235
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:33,270
the powers of those sites where. Switching or

236
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,760
converting that into in terms of the dual spins

237
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,390
would not actually suffice to resolve all of the

238
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:46,050
constraints and. But we would find is that the

239
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,900
dual system for the three dimensional is involved,

240
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,420
even though it's associated with the simple Kubic

241
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,350
lattice in three dimensions, which is the jewel of

242
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,940
the Cuban class, it's four degrees of freedom

243
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,230
would interact differently than the original using

244
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,550
model. Particular, they would have what's called a

245
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,260
cage interaction that is in some sense a discrete

246
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:17,820
analog of how photons behave. So from a three

247
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,600
dimensional using spin system to a theory that

248
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,380
looks more like quantum electrodynamics. So the

249
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,600
silk duality of the two dimensional using model is

250
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,500
a special feature and the one that allows us to

251
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,220
predict the transition temperature. Exactly.

252
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,140
And maybe the way in which modern dualities are

253
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,150
especially complicated is that they usually can't

254
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,910
be proven the way that we did yesterday, the

255
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,840
calculation that we went through was. A little

256
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,330
complicated, but fit into just a single class

257
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,100
meeting, whereas.

258
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,290
The two entities that are used in twenty first

259
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,500
century theoretical physics research are typically

260
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,190
not something that can be derived so completely,

261
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:22,290
but generally proceed by making a conjecture that

262
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,540
one system is dual to another argument how the

263
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,440
degrees of freedom and interactions are mapped out

264
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:35,970
to the other, and then checking that conjecture by

265
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,690
trying to compute as many different observables in

266
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,690
both the original system and the dual system as

267
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,140
possible. Also complicated because usually neither

268
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:51,750
of those systems are solvable themselves. So just

269
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:57,080
to give a. Shout out to one of the more famous or

270
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,430
widely discussed sets of dualities. There is a.

271
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,520
A whole class of duality relations that are known

272
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,550
as holographic duality is also sometimes called

273
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,680
idiocy of t devalues or gravities realities that

274
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,940
setting the terminology aside relate to certain

275
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,080
theories of quantum gravity, two theories that do

276
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,570
not involve gravitational interactions but are

277
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:33,700
still quantum theories of interaction, fields that

278
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,950
are. Can be built up to his generalizations of

279
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,730
interactive systems like those we've been looking

280
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:47,940
at the past couple of weeks, and just to give one

281
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,600
bit of.

282
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,840
Advertisement. Part of the motivation for fully

283
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,650
connected Latisse that we looked at last week is

284
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,340
that this appears in one of the more famous

285
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,100
holographic dualities that has attracted a lot of

286
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,170
research attention over about the past five years.

287
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,770
This is known as the swankier model named after

288
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,530
Sibiya Sachdev and Electronegative, who Sustiva

289
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,380
developed a model of interacting fermions on that

290
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:31,840
fully connected class back in the early 1990s. And

291
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,570
then over the summer of twenty fifteen, Aleksi

292
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:39,370
could have made the argument for the conjecture

293
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,840
that the behavior of these interacting fermions on

294
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,230
a fully connected lattice. Is secretly describing

295
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:55,050
the same dynamics as quantum black holes in the

296
00:20:55,050 --> 00:21:01,630
theory of quantum gravity. Which has in the. Past

297
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,330
five years or so led to about a thousand

298
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,780
scientific studies being published exploring

299
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,330
different aspects of the behavior of both of the.

300
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,250
Lattice side of the system, like a model itself of

301
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,170
fermions interacting, is fully connected lattice,

302
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,700
as well as the gravitational side of the duality,

303
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:29,610
the dynamics of black holes in quantum gravity. So

304
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,020
that is just a brief aside to highlight a

305
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,140
connection between some of the things that we've

306
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,660
been doing in this course and some of the really

307
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:44,590
hot topics of research. That it's going on as we

308
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,880
speak and also the final end of the extended

309
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:54,520
section that we had on these interactive systems

310
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,660
before moving on to. A final much before synthesis

311
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,540
and look at some broader applications of

312
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,850
sophistical physics, so

313
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:13,430
before setting aside completely checking to see if

314
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,510
there are any further questions or topics of

315
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:23,560
interest about about that topic, we will. The

316
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,010
building on it a bit more as we go into. Unit 10

317
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,300
at the.

318
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:37,410
And we have a few. Hours left for a quick look at

319
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,100
quick survey of some of these broader applications

320
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,770
of. Statistical physics and interacting

321
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,970
statistical systems especially.

322
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:56,730
So.

323
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,740
Starting with this, what I call a synthesis, we

324
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,260
will be bringing together some of the.

325
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,060
Work on interacting statistical systems built on

326
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,760
the statistical samples that we defined earlier in

327
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,790
the molecule and synthesizing that with the

328
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,420
numerical computing exercises that were the

329
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,840
project that you did earlier in this term. And the

330
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,420
motivation for this is that for these interacting

331
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,780
statistical systems, there is in general no way to

332
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,940
solve them. Exactly. The one dimensional using

333
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,050
model and two dimensions are very special in that

334
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,990
sense. And even if we were to turn on that

335
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,000
external magnetic field and the two dimensional

336
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,670
case. There will be no known exact solution and

337
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:56,640
possibly a. The issue is not whether or not, you

338
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,180
know, it is an exact solution may not even exist

339
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:05,250
for the non-zero feelings in two dimensions or the

340
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,860
three dimensional using model, any higher number

341
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:13,380
of dimensions that remain finite field theory is

342
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,000
just the approximation to the actual dynamics.

343
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,440
So if we want to explore more broadly the kinds of

344
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,650
interactions that are possible in statistical

345
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,510
systems, we need to. Do one of two approaches

346
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,990
either come up with some more systematic

347
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,720
approximation scheme, either bringing in

348
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,940
corrections to mean field theory or different

349
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:44,320
sorts of expansions in some small parameter or

350
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,020
some small coupling? This is the domain of

351
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,920
perturbation theory, that is. I'm not going to be

352
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,440
talked about here, it is usually featured in

353
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:57,820
modules on field theory and quantum mechanics the

354
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,600
other way that we can maybe more directly pursue.

355
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:07,020
Interactive statistical systems is by analyzing

356
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,740
them numerically using computers, which is an

357
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,280
approach that has become increasingly important as

358
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,930
computers have developed over the past 50 to 70

359
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:25,370
years. And in part, the development of that

360
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,970
computing technology has been driven by the need

361
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,930
for numerical computations to solve interacting

362
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,140
statistical systems in all of their guises, both

363
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,290
within mathematical sciences and beyond.

364
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,710
So. Considering the economic ensemble, just to be

365
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,860
definite, what we want to get from in America,

366
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,840
cooptation our predictions for any observable

367
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,580
expectation, values of interest, which. I try to

368
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,820
fix the focus there. We can recall artist

369
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,470
expressed as the sum of all microstates of that

370
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,160
quantity evaluated for the corresponding Bykov

371
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,700
state, aided by its credibility in the canonical

372
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:20,640
example, that probability. Is proportional to the

373
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,730
Boltzmann factor, the proportionality constant is

374
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,580
the partition function itself, something over all

375
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,700
these Balsom factors for all of the microcircuits

376
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,300
in the system?

377
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:39,280
And we mentioned when introducing InterAction's. A

378
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,780
couple of weeks ago that.

379
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,910
Exactly, evaluating all of the terms of the

380
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,760
microstates contributing to these songs that

381
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,180
defined expectation values is a fairly complex

382
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,950
task. So if we consider just a simple, easy model

383
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:04,170
to a spin system with freedom has only two states

384
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,230
and say we have roughly a thousand spins. Then

385
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,840
there are something like 10 to the power three

386
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,740
hundred terms in that artificial function and even

387
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,550
the largest existing supercomputer or even one

388
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:21,160
that we can imagine, would have to burn far longer

389
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,300
than the age of the universe to churn through all

390
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,870
of those different microstates in a naive brute

391
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:32,380
force approach. So if we have lattice sizes that

392
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,490
are 10 cubed in the three dimensions using Model

393
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,990
Six in the Fourth Dimension Olesen model. It

394
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:46,850
already seems to me that these tiny systems are

395
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:51,320
out of reach of numerical computing. Never mind

396
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:56,240
the thermal limits where. Dynamics of interest

397
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,210
like these transitions are formally defined. But

398
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,290
at the same time, just a few days later, we were

399
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:09,920
able to. Quote, Numerical results for the critical

400
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,660
temperature of the U.S. model in three dimensions,

401
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,660
four, five, six and up to seven dimensions that we

402
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,990
compare to to the field approximation to observe

403
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:25,730
that the visual approach became more accurate as a

404
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:31,850
number of nationalities increased. So obviously

405
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,100
those numerical results were not attained by

406
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,560
something over all microstates states and the

407
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,460
corresponding system. And instead took an approach

408
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:46,220
of sampling a subset of those microstates selected

409
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,300
in some pseudo random way based on the pseudo

410
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,420
random numbers that are available to us. On

411
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:57,220
computers, as we saw on the computer project, and

412
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:02,890
then by reducing this overall sum over microstates

413
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:07,390
to just a sum over a small set of randomly sample

414
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:14,000
microstates. We would get predictions for the

415
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,890
usual, for an anemic observables, energy

416
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:21,940
magnetization and so on. That's. The law of large

417
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,480
numbers would relate to the true expectation value

418
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,030
so long as a sufficiently large.

419
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:34,270
Number of states we consider. So this general

420
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:38,230
approach, which uses the pseudo random numbers

421
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:44,140
available to computing hardware to sample a subset

422
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,920
of the possible microstates is known as. A Monte

423
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:55,340
Carlo method, which is a whimsical name, that is.

424
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:02,380
Referencing a casino gambling center in Monaco,

425
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,730
the south of France, and these multicolor methods

426
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:10,570
are very widely used and very crucial in

427
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,150
statistical physics and all sorts of related

428
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:18,400
disciplines, thanks to their applicability to

429
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,760
interacting systems where we are not able to

430
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,450
obtain exact solutions or benefit from the

431
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,740
factorization of non interactive systems.

432
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:39,690
It's been a bit of intuition for how to use

433
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:43,910
multiple methods are working by. Actually doing a

434
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,260
Monte Carlo calculation here in class to

435
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:52,650
numerically evaluate a simple integral. So the

436
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,350
idea is the so-called Monte Carlo with the

437
00:30:55,350 --> 00:31:02,460
creation. That's. Rather than evaluating the

438
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,950
integral analytically or approximating its

439
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:10,080
function as a piece, a smooth quantity, they can

440
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,540
be fed through a.

441
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:21,360
Trapezoid, rule or elaborations thereof? We can

442
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,260
randomly sample points in the integration domain,

443
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,230
evaluate the integrity at each of those points,

444
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,580
and then normalize by the total number of points

445
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,620
that we sample. So if we consider the integral of

446
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,620
the two dimensional plane, which does not quite

447
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:46,410
fit on the screen with its illustration. So

448
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:50,310
integrating over X and Y both from minus one to

449
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:55,150
one of this heavy side function. Which is one,

450
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,590
whenever its argument is positive or zero and

451
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:02,250
negative for or sorry to zero for any negative

452
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,150
arguments, we can see that negative arguments

453
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,460
occur when X squared plus Y squared is greater

454
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:13,650
than one which defines the unit. This with radius

455
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:20,630
one in this. Integration domain. With area four,

456
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:26,620
two by two in both X and Y. So by sampling, as

457
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,950
shown, the green dots in this figure, random

458
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,850
points in that integration domain and counting the

459
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:39,880
number that fall within that, this will end up

460
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,720
with a prediction for the area of Baptist's, which

461
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,440
is known to its friends as high higher squared

462
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,090
with R equals one.

463
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,590
So simply counting the fraction of the samples

464
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:57,670
that end up inside or outside of the this

465
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,730
evaluates that integration of the heavy side step

466
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:05,770
function and gives us pi up to some statistical

467
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:10,930
uncertainty that we can show. Decrease is

468
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,870
proportional to the number of independent samples

469
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:20,260
that we consider in order to evaluate. This

470
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,680
integral three multicultural approach and setting

471
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,730
up this calculation was what I was struggling with

472
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:34,410
just at the start of. The class today, this is the

473
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,040
very short python code that.

474
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:45,620
Is linked from the lecture notes, just a few lines

475
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:52,150
with a bit of elaboration for estimating the

476
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,860
statistical uncertainties that we can go into if

477
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,630
there is time and interest.

478
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:04,000
Since I had this all queued up in Google CoLab,

479
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:09,190
but it was not letting me log in, it wasn't

480
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,460
recognizing me on this system, so I need to head

481
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:18,280
back to it and hopefully just be able to paste

482
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,440
this code into a new.

483
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:30,340
Notebook as. A user who is the site was what was

484
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,130
causing trouble, so let's try.

485
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,770
Riblet.

486
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,190
Warick.

487
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,130
I want a basic python shell.

488
00:34:54,470 --> 00:35:01,230
And see if I need to sign in to run this guy. Nope,

489
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:05,080
it's already up and under way, and in a couple of

490
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,510
seconds, we were able to evaluate the pie is

491
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,410
roughly three point one four three plus or minus

492
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:15,570
006. So a couple of decimal places there. I'll

493
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:20,260
just leave that running in the background for the

494
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,280
next few minutes, see what we're able to get out

495
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,130
by the end of the hour today.

496
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,550
We should see that we'll get four or five

497
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,210
significant figures in our determination of pi

498
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:41,380
from integration by the end of the hour, which.

499
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,040
It's amusing, but not the best way to compute PI.

500
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,240
It's much more efficient to take advantage of

501
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,610
specialized relationships and serious expansions

502
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,960
that end up being related to circular experiences,

503
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:03,070
hyperbolic functions. That's. We're talking about

504
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,840
his multicolor integration in the final unit on

505
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,860
broader applications, and that is because we're

506
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,490
motivated by multicolor integration being very

507
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,950
broadly applicable. Not just to computing power,

508
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,350
evaluating three dimensional integrals, but also.

509
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,130
Evaluating the high dimensional integrals, which

510
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,590
is the domain in which multicolor integration is

511
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,910
most useful, where by high dimensional integral I

512
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:37,230
have in mind that we take our statistical system.

513
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,080
And it's partition function, for instance, and

514
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:46,030
interpret that system as an integration over all

515
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:52,550
of the degrees of freedom. That can vary as we

516
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,590
change from one microstates to the next. So the

517
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,580
idea is that if we have a billion degrees of

518
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:05,540
freedom, like that's the typical scale of.

519
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,150
Numerical research using multicolor methods that

520
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,930
goes on here at the university. Those billion

521
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:18,170
degrees of freedom at all interacting with each

522
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,310
other can be represented as an integral over a

523
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,570
billion variables like ability, dimensional,

524
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:29,060
integral, and then the value of that integral in

525
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,940
the corresponding expectation, values of

526
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,460
attributes that depend on those billion degrees of

527
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:39,230
freedom can just be evaluated by Montecarlo

528
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:43,840
sampling. And in particular, what logical

529
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,010
integration? That's sort of the state of the art

530
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:51,610
that is accessible with the supercomputers that

531
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:55,010
exist today. Well, beyond just that simple three

532
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,410
dimensional piece of pie that we're running in the

533
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,310
background now.

534
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:08,070
That is to wrap up today with a few. More comments

535
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,910
there is. An election you might make something you

536
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:16,550
might be worried about. If you think back to where

537
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,460
we started off, this unit of other applications by

538
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:23,360
noting that explicitly evaluating all of the

539
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,450
microstates of the system would take far longer

540
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:30,980
than the age of the universe, if we are sampling

541
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,060
some subset of those microstates in some

542
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,970
reasonable amount of time, say a day or a week or

543
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:41,600
a month, that amount of time is very small

544
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:47,570
compared to the universe, which implies that the

545
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:50,300
fraction of the microstates that we can possibly

546
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,170
consider in that time is correspondingly,

547
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:59,420
extremely small. And. You might be worried about

548
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:04,670
the risk of. Claiming that we can extract reliable

549
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:09,050
results for these expectation values from sampling

550
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:13,160
such a small number of microstates, so this is

551
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,610
essentially the same. Issue that we started off by

552
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,890
worrying about, we just sort of turned it on its

553
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:24,010
head by saying, rather than worrying about how

554
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,590
long it takes you down with everything, we're

555
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:30,560
worrying about how little we can evaluate. In a

556
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,870
reasonable amount of time, so just to make this

557
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:37,790
concrete. Suppose we go back to that tiny easing

558
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:40,880
system with roughly a thousand degrees of freedom.

559
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,590
And suppose that we have some computer that can

560
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,820
sample a of that system every nanosecond, so a

561
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,240
billion microstates, every second, which is a bit

562
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,960
generous but not completely absurd. In terms of

563
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,010
what is possible with

564
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,090
the laws of physics that govern how computers

565
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:07,870
operate. So if you look over the course of the day.

566
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,340
We have about a quarter of thousand seconds per

567
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,340
hour and over twenty four hours of the day, so

568
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:21,390
there is ten to the four. Seconds of the day,

569
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:24,750
during each of which we evaluate the microstates

570
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:28,440
in the system, ending up with roughly 10 trillion.

571
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,080
Spin configurations sampled out of the total. That

572
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,180
was about 10 to the power. Three hundred

573
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:41,420
microstates. So any numerical results we obtained

574
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,590
from that sampling?

575
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,250
Would take into account only one part in 10 to the

576
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,730
power to eighty seven of the total number of

577
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:55,340
microstates, so this is a vanishingly small

578
00:40:55,340 --> 00:41:01,710
fraction and it's very easy to imagine that. The.

579
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,820
One out of every 10 to the power to 87,

580
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,490
microstates that we look at are not necessarily

581
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:12,690
representative of the vast majority of microstates

582
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,330
that we should really be accounting for in order

583
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:18,970
to predict what the quantities. And things

584
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,120
actually get much worse if we consider larger

585
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,020
systems where the number of micro states increases

586
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,720
exponentially in the number of degrees of freedom.

587
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,280
In addition to each individual microstates also

588
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,790
requiring more computation in order to to be

589
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:41,020
considered. So as a illustration of how this

590
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:47,090
operates, I've linked here. The reference for some

591
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,000
of the work on using models and five, six and

592
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,590
seven dimensions that produced the values of the

593
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:57,410
critical temperature will be compared to the

594
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:02,340
Medfield approximation. Last week. Or the larger

595
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:05,070
scale calculations that this work was able to

596
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:09,420
consider is a system of sixty four to the fifth

597
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,750
using spins in five dimensions, so sixty four

598
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,930
spins on each of the five dimensions of the system.

599
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:21,460
Which, if we convert that to base 10, is. Roughly

600
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,970
a billion Tagami degrees of freedom, so the number

601
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,840
of microstates is down to two billion, two to the

602
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:31,840
10 to the power line which converted the base, 10

603
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,960
is roughly ten to the three hundred million

604
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:40,280
possible microstates. And in that result for the

605
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,610
political temperature that we predicted. We saw

606
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:51,510
that outside only in this work, about ten thousand

607
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:54,810
or fifteen thousand of those ten to the three

608
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,930
hundred million microstates were considered. So

609
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:02,190
it's reasonable to ask how much trust do we or how

610
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:04,690
much do we trust those results?

611
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:10,990
There is a.

612
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:16,240
Not quite going to finish this discussion today.

613
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:19,240
We'll come back to it on Friday, along with the

614
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:23,200
other broader implications if we think about the

615
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,760
easing system in. More specifically, that is being

616
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,420
considered in this case, we could make an argument

617
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,180
that in the high-temperature disordered phase,

618
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:40,100
things are like, OK. Because we started off by

619
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,140
seeing that as the temperature gets higher and

620
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,250
higher, the various different microstates are

621
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,860
adopted with equal probabilities and the

622
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,610
expectation values then are determined by which of

623
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,490
the energy levels has the greatest degeneracy, the

624
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:59,180
greatest number of microstates responds to it. So

625
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,660
the more microstates there are, the more likely

626
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:07,240
they are to be among that. One out of the 300

627
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,480
million that is sampled by this pseudo random

628
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:16,530
numerical procedure. So it is at least plausible

629
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,090
that we could get reasonable results in this phase

630
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:25,140
by averaging even over such a tiny fraction of the

631
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:28,170
total number of microstates in the system. But of

632
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:32,070
course, the opposite is the case in the low

633
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:38,040
temperature ordered phase. Where we saw that. The

634
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:45,290
expectation values in this phase. Are dominated by

635
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,240
a very small number of microstates, approaching

636
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,810
just the two degenerate micro states that have the

637
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:56,100
minimum value for the energy. All of the is

638
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,120
aligned in one of the two directions that they can

639
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,330
point either all up with the value plus one or all

640
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:08,390
down with the value minus one and then. On top of

641
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:11,270
the contributions from that ground state, there

642
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:13,580
would be only exponentially suppressed corrections

643
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:19,570
from higher energy levels and. If we were to

644
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:24,130
proceed by randomly sampling one out of every 10

645
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:26,980
to the three hundred million microstates, there is

646
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:30,450
essentially zero chance that we would randomly

647
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:34,000
happen the sample, one of those special minimum

648
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,860
energy states where all the spins are ordered

649
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:40,830
completely up or down. There's. Essentially, one

650
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:44,220
hundred percent chance of missing the dominant

651
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:51,000
contributions to the expectation values. Making it

652
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,950
seem as though. The approach of randomly sampling

653
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:59,300
microstates to medically evaluate the expectation

654
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:06,560
values is doomed to fail. So the solution to this

655
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:13,610
conundrum that we will. Go through on Friday is to

656
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,250
sample microstates not completely randomly, with a

657
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:21,840
probability proportional to the bolson factor with

658
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,850
which they appear in the partition function and in

659
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:31,950
the expectation value that we want to go after. So

660
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,860
that is known as important sampling and is where

661
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:39,720
we will pick up on Friday. I will stop.

662
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,890
Going through that now as we are running out of

663
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:47,190
time, and you think if you have any questions

664
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:51,180
before we end, we can hop back to. The

665
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:55,350
calculations going on here to see that we have not

666
00:46:55,350 --> 00:47:01,320
quite gotten through the. Final round of computing

667
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:04,830
pie through Montecarlo integration, but in the

668
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:09,360
space of about five minutes, we were able to find

669
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:13,920
a value of pie that was three point one four one

670
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,360
eight plus or minus seven in that last digits. So

671
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:24,170
correctly reproducing the node value. And with a

672
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,890
statistical accuracy that steadily increases as

673
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:31,520
advertised, like the square root of the number of

674
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,940
samples that are being considered. If I had been

675
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:39,350
able to plug into the Google CoLab, that provides

676
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:41,810
a bit more powerful computing than.

677
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,540
This calculation would have taken only about.

678
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:54,850
Several times would have completed several times

679
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:57,700
more quickly, taken several times less computing

680
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,310
and given us the answer,

681
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:07,440
they here that you can go and run. Yourselves, if

682
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,630
you are so inclined, see how many digits you can

683
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:10,050
get in

684
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:15,990
here down to uncertainty from the statistics of

685
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,540
two in the fourth decimal place.

686
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,720
Wrap up there for today and then back on Friday to

687
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:31,560
finish off the broader applications and any

688
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,780
dangling loose ends for the Marshall.

689
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:04,340
OK.

690
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:10,740
So.
