1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,050
All right, let's get things underway this Friday morning,

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,320
approaching the end of February.  It may be that

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,950
all the news from Europe has distracted all of us

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,100
over the past few days, but it's probably best to

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,770
persist in what we have to deal with in front of

6
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,250
us for the time being.  Of which, the first thing to

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:38,090
deal with is the magic number for the system

8
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:45,820
today is seven eight four, three, four, zero.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,200
And let's catch up

10
00:00:53,740 --> 00:01:02,150
with where we got to go earlier in this week

11
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,360
and where we're going today and over the coming week.

12
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:14,030
So for this day a few quick logistics notes.

13
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,130
First homework assignment is due next Thursday,

14
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,540
3rd of March.

15
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,590
May well spend some time looking at it and making

16
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,020
sure it is all clear to dig to this afternoon in

17
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,190
the tutorial, among other things, like wrapping up

18
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,700
that discussion of Serling's for more and then

19
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,010
also fix the typo. I noticed in the lecture notes

20
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,600
on Tuesday where they sent over and particle's had

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,000
incorrectly written that as it sunk from zero to

22
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,260
infinity, which is only valid in the limit of

23
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:04,910
infinite particles. Now. That sun came up in the

24
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:12,780
context that we are working on now of the. Ideal

25
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,290
gas.

26
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,820
They analyzed through the framework of the

27
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:24,170
canonical ensemble. The statistical sampling

28
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,570
probability space that we get with the temperature

29
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:31,970
and particle number fixed of that particular non

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,910
relativistic. Classical.

31
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:44,840
And you'll us. In a container, a box of Boliva

32
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,670
allocute.

33
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,500
On your side of the boy, you in turn. Produces.

34
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,650
Discrete energy levels.

35
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,360
For us to analyze coming from the discrete moments

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:13,300
of. Each bar pi over L. Times the vector of

37
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,610
non-negative integers.

38
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,940
So. What we're looking at their.

39
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,410
Which is what I had on the screen to.

40
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,950
Custody, the focus and the brightness of the

41
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,710
protector today is driving the canonical

42
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,710
competition function, the starting point for

43
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,490
analysis of economic momcilo. And as we did with

44
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,620
spin systems on Monday, considering what the case

45
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,180
of distinguishable and indistinguishable particles,

46
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,170
finding out that these differ by a factor that

47
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,980
counts the number of possible ways of

48
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,110
distinguishing a set of particles with all of the

49
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,650
momentum, the resulting energy is the same is the

50
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,800
simple fact of any factorial leaving the

51
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:18,970
competition functions. For the discreetness, would

52
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,430
indistinguishable, indistinguishable cases, so are

53
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,870
their. Questions about. What we've gotten up to

54
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,400
and what we are going to pick up on that today.

55
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,530
So we began that. So given the economic

56
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,920
competition function that we drive to, the next

57
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,750
step is to gain

58
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,060
predictions for the large scale macroscopic

59
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,750
observable features of these ideal systems, in

60
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,830
particular focusing as usual on the internal

61
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,200
energy systems, the same quantities we looked at

62
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,030
in the case of spin systems. If that first

63
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,060
application we canal, for example, at the end of

64
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,920
Unit three on Monday, we went through the

65
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,730
derivation of that energy and entropy and the

66
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,850
indistinguishable case to the more complicated one.

67
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,990
Where that Helmholtz free energy is a convenient

68
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,140
repackaging of these partition functions, taking

69
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,840
the war, multiply them by the negative temperature

70
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,140
and then taking derivatives of that free energy.

71
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,950
Give us both the internal energy and the interview

72
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,850
that internal energy boils down to something quite

73
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,490
simple. Three 1/2 times the number of particles,

74
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,490
types of temperature, everything else in the

75
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,100
protection function is independent of the

76
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,570
temperature drops out of the derivative. And

77
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,020
plugging things into the entropy, we recover.

78
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,160
Another term coming from this expression to be

79
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,070
derived based on the free energy relating to all

80
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,960
three of these quantities. So in addition to that,

81
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,490
three jobs and the energy we have, the.

82
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,810
Contribution to the HUMBOLDT'S free energy itself.

83
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,650
Bringing in some remaining dependents can

84
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,590
approximate with Serling's formula. We talked

85
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:36,330
about at some length. In the tutorial. Ending up

86
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,890
with an injury of five hands and time plus end

87
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,250
times, the longer this ratio of the volume of the

88
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,600
container times and times, the cube of this

89
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,990
thermal double, the wave length that we define

90
00:06:52,470 --> 00:07:00,110
which. We can. We may see where you can trust me

91
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,650
when I say that this is or can be thought of as a

92
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,190
way of associating a light scale with each of

93
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,180
these particles at a given temperature. That's.

94
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,880
Can be interpreted, that is the amount of the

95
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,780
volume occupied by these particles and in

96
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,590
particular the ratio of the total amount of oil

97
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,940
available divided by. The amount of that volume

98
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,890
that is occupied and I went through reiterated

99
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,560
these things that we have already done in some

100
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,420
detail, just because if we move on to the next

101
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,460
stage of repeating this analysis for the

102
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,270
distinguishable case, we can actually just

103
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,660
essentially write down the answers from the

104
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,860
indistinguishably case. We go back to the relation

105
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,080
that we had that was just a factor of any

106
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,650
factorial difference between the supervision

107
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,340
functions. And we can see that this point

108
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,010
factorial that's contributing to that second term.

109
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,100
Again, we have goals for energy in the industry

110
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,380
for the case. So all that remains, if we remove

111
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:17,470
that to get to the of the case is. A slightly

112
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:22,120
complicated expression. So I ask you to shout out,

113
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,420
just copy down from the previous page,

114
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,760
that first term, the innocence of the case,

115
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,290
carries on to the distinguishable case without the

116
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,290
one over in Vectorial. That's.

117
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,220
We would be would be introduced if we had to

118
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,410
identify a lot of these distinguishable

119
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,350
microstates adding up to give us the protection

120
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,630
function of the free energy. And now. Something

121
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,820
interesting happens. Moving on to the energy this

122
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,620
year, boy in Vectorial with three by team is just

123
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,680
part of these t independent terms that don't

124
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,870
affect the energy coming from the places that we

125
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,650
derive from the chemical ensemble. So the

126
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:19,030
derivation with distinguishable case is turns out

127
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,580
to be exactly the same as that for the

128
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:27,250
indistinguishable tree energy and then moving on

129
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:32,360
to the entropy. We have this. Relation between

130
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,200
these two terms, we see that the difference coming

131
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,960
into the Helmholtz free energy is going to carry

132
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,640
through into the entropy PACULA. We don't have

133
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,610
this log in Vectorial factor to expand out anymore.

134
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:57,740
We're just left with. Three have in plus and Lord,

135
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:06,180
the over the thermal cube, which, not surprisingly,

136
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,000
is what's written in these equations. Fifty two

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,440
and fifty three for us to check the energies are

138
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,970
unaffected by it, whether or not the. Particles in

139
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,610
this ideal of gas are distinguishable, but the

140
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:27,310
entropies do have a difference, reflecting the

141
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,300
different amounts of information that we have in

142
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,510
principle about the system, depending on whether

143
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,300
or not we can distinguish the particles that

144
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,160
compose it. So.

145
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,470
In one sense, this behavior of the entropy

146
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,470
equation. Fifty three is a bit like we saw for

147
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,770
that same system as the first example at the end

148
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,190
of Unit three. There is a difference in the

149
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,170
behavior of the system, depending purely on the

150
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,650
information content that is available in principle

151
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,970
for that system. We also had different energies

152
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,320
and.

153
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,910
The if we want to boil down, this is a brief

154
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,440
remarks for you to think about if you are so

155
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,770
inclined. The reason the energy is come out the

156
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,730
same here, but came up differently in the case of

157
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,980
Spain, systems has to do with. How the

158
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,630
distinguishable and indistinguishable micro states

159
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,510
are connected to each other in this case, I guess

160
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,050
we just saw that every indistinguishably

161
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,680
microstates maps on to and vectorial

162
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,220
distinguishable microstates independent of the

163
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,440
energy of those microphages from the different

164
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,190
ways of labeling the particles that we're three.

165
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,360
And you saw that the the number of distinguishable

166
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,080
micro states varies depending on how many of the

167
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,120
spins are pointing up or down. There are many more

168
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,030
micro states with roughly even numbers of up and

169
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,170
down point expense compared to the extreme cases

170
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,660
with the maximum of the minimum amounts of energy,

171
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,470
like the grand stage, where in both the

172
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,790
distinction center in this case, there's only that

173
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:21,000
single grand state. So the.

174
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,700
That no mapping distinguishable in the same

175
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,480
microstates all to each other in the ideal gas

176
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,180
case that's independent of the energy. Just that

177
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,730
simple act of vectorial in all cases that we can

178
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:43,130
bring side of the partition function. But for the

179
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,240
spin system, the factor vary with the energy

180
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,990
leading to, in that case, a difference in the

181
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,360
internal energy, depending on the information

182
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,550
content, which we do not cover in the ideal gas

183
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:03,140
case. And as the a couple of final remarks. So

184
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,690
looking at these two expressions for

185
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,970
distinguishable and indistinguishable energy

186
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,220
entropies, which is fifty three,

187
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,390
if we want to think about the energy, is

188
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,780
quantifying the amount of information that we have

189
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,090
about these systems, the amount of different ways

190
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,640
there are

191
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,040
a sign of the system to microstates, you would

192
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,520
expect that in the case of many more microstates

193
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:36,530
it would be a larger entropy. And we can confirm

194
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,920
that despite the the difference in this linear

195
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,200
term here, just because there is also this factor

196
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,450
in showing up in the war with another end out

197
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,550
front and that in the end is created and for any

198
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,180
reasonable number of particles. So subtracting off

199
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,440
and again from the extra linear term we have in

200
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,430
this case does give us the expected relation.

201
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,150
That's just a possibility that leads to larger

202
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,750
entropy

203
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,990
and. I was sort of driving to the other

204
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,660
observation earlier, looking at the. Interview for

205
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,420
the quintessential case where we have this log of

206
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,870
the ratio of the total volume of the container

207
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,190
divided by this end times, different length cube

208
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,390
that we interpret as the volume of the container

209
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:41,000
that's occupied by the particles in the gas. And

210
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:41,820
if that.

211
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,930
Occupation fraction happens to drop below one.

212
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,910
That the second term here is in times of log of a

213
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,450
number between zero one would be negative and

214
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,770
indeed as the temperature approaches absolute zero,

215
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,330
this boy wavelength.

216
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:10,110
I should probably. Record. Here, for reference,

217
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,600
was a nice place for it.

218
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,100
So.

219
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,670
The wavelength is.

220
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,420
Two pi squared over.

221
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:35,660
And he. What would that? To the square root, so as

222
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,110
the temperature goes to zero, the wavelength

223
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,170
diverges to infinity and so the argument to the

224
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,740
logarithm approaches zero. So the entropy appears

225
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,630
to diverge to an infinite negative number, which

226
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,940
is problematic if we think of it as. On a count of

227
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,560
the number of microstates available, depending on

228
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:03,280
energy. What's going on here is that this is

229
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,190
exactly the regime where our assumption that the

230
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:11,330
collapse of gas is classical is breaking down. So

231
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,680
we did that in a few weeks. So certainly before

232
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:20,850
the verdict sometime in March. So. Those are the

233
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,450
basic observables, internal energy and entropy for

234
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,870
ideal gases of both dismissable and

235
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,380
indistinguishable particles. Are there questions

236
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,040
about the derivations or conclusions being taken

237
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,590
away from these expressions?

238
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,090
The next topic is. Something known as the Gibbs

239
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:51,160
paradox, which is. Not terminology I particularly

240
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,800
care for, because that's we'll see, there is no

241
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,910
paradox in the end,

242
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,790
but it is one of the important topics in

243
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,970
statistical physics that illustrates some of the.

244
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,440
Ways of thinking about these collections of large

245
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,170
numbers of particles, the ways that large scale

246
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,450
physical behavior emerges from microscopic

247
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:18,010
dynamics, and also the dangers of sort of

248
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,610
qualitative physics based argumentation with

249
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:25,240
insufficient appeal to detailed mathematical

250
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,940
calculation, which is probably the case for a lot

251
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,770
of so-called paradoxes in modern physics. They

252
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:38,030
arise if you try to work by analogy and. Every

253
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:44,270
argumentation and show to be or not an issue upon

254
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,650
going through the detailed mathematics, so the set

255
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,330
up for. Looking at the Gibs paradox, which is

256
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,600
related to something called the mixing energy is

257
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,050
to.

258
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,200
Repeat the same sort of. Thought experiments that

259
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,340
we did a few weeks ago when we. We're considering

260
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,420
biochemical systems and we wonder what would

261
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,970
happen if we took two micro economical systems,

262
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,210
put them into verbal contact that allowed them to

263
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,940
exchange energy, and then we isolate them. And we

264
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:27,070
saw that energy flows from one of these systems to

265
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,890
the other unless they had the same temperature.

266
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,340
And through that process, the second law of

267
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,000
thermodynamics was we actually derived a simple

268
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,850
form of it so that the entropy never decreased.

269
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,530
And in general, increases, though, in that

270
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,800
calculation, we had to be careful to account for

271
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,010
all the entropy after we isolated the two systems,

272
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:55,970
keeping track of the fact that. Once the systems

273
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,540
had been allowed to exchange energy. In the micro

274
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,440
political setup, we had to. Some over all the

275
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,840
possible distributions of energy after the storm

276
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,390
contact has been made and then broken. So we're

277
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,570
going to generalize that same approach to the

278
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,280
economical systems, these are already allowed to

279
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,630
exchange energy with their surroundings that form

280
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,020
a reservoir that fixes their temperature. What we

281
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,950
will now do is take two economical systems and

282
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,180
bring them into. Contact in such a way that

283
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:39,110
they're allowed to exchange protocols and then

284
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,250
after they have exchanged those particles reach

285
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,460
some equilibrium, we separate them. We can think

286
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,220
about this either as removing a. Wall separating

287
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,770
two identical boxes or to make it slightly more

288
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,070
every day.

289
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,730
Situation we can think of, this is opening a door

290
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,730
between two rooms that we will suppose have the

291
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,790
same temperature tea and just for simplicity, we

292
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,100
will also formulate this.

293
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,690
Canonical ensembles of ideal classes with the same

294
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:26,060
number of particles then and the same volume V as

295
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,200
simple as possible case that we can construct for

296
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,850
this thought experiment, see temperature, same

297
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,940
volume and the same number of particles. And like

298
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,870
I have to zoom out a bit. They have all three

299
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:46,690
stages of this process on the screen at once. We

300
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:52,210
start off with these two systems, A and B, that

301
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,760
have that fixed temperature or energy issues with

302
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,700
the environment. Upon removing the wall that

303
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,310
separates them, we have the combined system, see?

304
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:09,870
Norman. We are going to be interested in. What

305
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:17,220
happens to the entropies, say, S.B, at sea as this

306
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,520
process proceeds after allowing political exchange

307
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,830
in this new system with twice the number of

308
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,680
particles, twice the volume, still the same

309
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,730
temperature? Assuming there is a large thermal

310
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,160
reservoir around the entire system, that

311
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,760
temperature will be three isolates, the systems

312
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:42,570
reinsert that wall. That in between them, we still

313
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,940
expect the second law of thermodynamics to be type

314
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,920
to be obeyed and the entropy never to have

315
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,490
decreased. So.

316
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,100
As we just saw in the. First part of today's

317
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,390
discussion, the entropy is dependent on whether or

318
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,210
not the particles in this gas are distinguishable

319
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,420
from each other and just as we did for the

320
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,730
duration of the entropy.

321
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,170
We start by considering that case,

322
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,640
indistinguishable particles.

323
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,260
Rachel.

324
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,360
Is to some extent the easier system to consider

325
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,040
because there's less information to keep track of,

326
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:38,700
which is the total number of particles as well as

327
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:38,970
the.

328
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,910
The volumes of the systems that they are contained

329
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:54,030
within the boxes contain gases. So if the gaps

330
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:58,030
here are. Simple calculations, but they are

331
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:01,610
calculations is trying to get in. Talk to them

332
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:07,460
myself rather than. Asking. What do you expect?

333
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,960
What we have for that first stage with two

334
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,550
identical ideal gases and with the same

335
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:22,810
temperature and in volumes, the boxes with the

336
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:28,420
same volume, we have twice the contribution from

337
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:33,040
that in this case of the entropy, depending on the

338
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,890
number of intersexual particles and the volume

339
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:40,330
they're contained in. Which you look back a few

340
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,640
pages ahead. That was five halves in for the

341
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:52,000
interview. The initial case was that and the board

342
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,140
of the over and. Then cubicle. Which.

343
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,200
Is the easy calculations to.

344
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,690
Down here, and they want to compare this initial

345
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,470
interview from before the two systems are brought

346
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,430
into while we're allowed to exchange particle's.

347
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,340
With the entropy of the combined system after

348
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,820
particle exchanges allowed in this case, we still

349
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:35,510
have essential particles so we can refer back to

350
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,900
the results of the derivation we did for the

351
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,300
entropy. In that case, we just have to involve

352
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,650
them in a container that has twice the volume. Of

353
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,540
the two that we started off with. Instead of

354
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:56,240
reading. Plug this into that expression. It's five

355
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,970
1/2 times the total number of particles, 210.

356
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:04,500
Eight to end times the law on the ratio of twice

357
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:11,050
the volume. To be over this to Ed. The boy,

358
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:18,810
Wavelength Kyun. Which boils down to five and plus.

359
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,160
To that, she was canceling that ratio.

360
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,660
And we come back with exactly the interview we

361
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,080
started off with. And that is consistent with the

362
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,540
second law of thermodynamics, entropy does not

363
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,570
decrease. It has just the same which.

364
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,140
Engaging in some of that qualitative physical

365
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,010
argumentation I work against is what we would

366
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,770
intuitively expect if we have two identical

367
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,410
systems, two identical rooms, open the door

368
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,320
between them, you don't expect anything very

369
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,470
dramatic to happen. This is reflected in the

370
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,680
entropy here as well as the energy. The more

371
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,840
trivial

372
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,540
we separate in the systems now is more complicated.

373
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:18,650
Because when we close that door or we insert the

374
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,250
wall that you have, you don't necessarily know how

375
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,300
many particles are going to end up on each side of

376
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,740
that barrier. What everyone here is going back to

377
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,060
the starting case with there were in particles in

378
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,730
the left and the right. But there are.

379
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:45,390
Obviously, and other possibilities where. Anywhere

380
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,240
from zero particles could have ended up on the

381
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:53,220
left hand side of that barrier, which we argued in

382
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,580
Dettori over the past couple of weeks, is unlikely

383
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,720
and should be expected on the basis of the equal

384
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,050
probabilities for all microstates. Similarly, we

385
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,740
don't expect all to enter the particles to end up

386
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,150
on the left hand system that will make it a crime.

387
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,790
But those are still possibilities that are still

388
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,770
valid, microstates that will contribute to the

389
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:24,460
entropy and have to be kept track of. So.

390
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,450
The total number of microstates involve something

391
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,890
over all possible ways of dividing the particles

392
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:38,000
between the two separate boxes when we compute the

393
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,730
partition function and. For this, he's to be

394
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,530
separated systems. This is the tricky part that I

395
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:51,740
shouldn't rush through. And I will emphasize that

396
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,310
performing this song over all of the possible

397
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,800
microstates that we can get from all the different

398
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,550
ways of dividing the particles between these two

399
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,390
systems has to be done at the stage of computing

400
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,520
the partition function, because the entropy then

401
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:13,910
is the derivative of the free energy, the log of

402
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:18,230
that partition function. And we need to make sure

403
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,290
that the entropy captures the log of the sun,

404
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:28,730
which is not the same as something else. So. In a

405
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:33,620
general case, if some number of new particles end

406
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,710
up in that we separated parts of the left, this is

407
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,730
still a big problem. Then we know how many

408
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,190
particles are in the other box. The total number

409
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,450
to N minus this new that is the left. So the

410
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:51,620
contribution. To the partition function from this

411
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:58,150
case is the. Total number of ways of selecting

412
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,370
those new particles.

413
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:10,530
This is the indistinguishable. Partition function

414
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:16,560
for new particles, which is given by. The new

415
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,390
power of that ratio be over to places like Cuba

416
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,710
that we saw before, normalizing Ivy, whatever new

417
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,790
factorial, indistinguishable ways of selecting new

418
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:35,130
particles. So that is. The. Number of

419
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,890
possibilities on the left side, left hand box

420
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,110
after the separation. We have to multiply that by

421
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,660
the. Number of microstates, we have the different

422
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,710
moments in the

423
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,590
we separated box on the right, the make to be

424
00:29:54,630 --> 00:30:00,100
prone to put it all together, we have. News

425
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:06,630
canceling out in. The product of these ratios V

426
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,440
over Lamda could and he was just the total number

427
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,440
of particles. And the power that that factor is

428
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,090
race to and then a combination of factors that is

429
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,240
looking a little bit like if I know your

430
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,020
coefficients.

431
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,190
Just missing the overall factor of two in

432
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:34,840
Vectorial, this is a complicated expression, but

433
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:39,090
it is just one term in the overall sum for the

434
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,400
petition function of the three separate systems at

435
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,990
the final stage of the experiment. We have to take

436
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:47,470
these.

437
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,240
Partition functions, that's new for the cases of

438
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,390
all the particles, all the possible ways these two

439
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,760
particles can be distributed between the two

440
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,560
systems, some of those. And I have gone ahead here

441
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,180
and replaced this. Whatever the product, the new

442
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,050
factorial times two and minus factorial with the

443
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:17,490
binomial coefficient divided by one over two and

444
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:22,210
factorial. That it's just a simple mathematical

445
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:27,340
identity. So the overall entropy after we

446
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:32,210
separated these systems. Is and given by the three

447
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:35,150
terms that come from taking the log of this

448
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,670
product, the three factors which in particular

449
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,710
involves this log of a sum of many binomial

450
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,810
coefficients. Which is not the easiest expression

451
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:57,340
to move to work with and as. We forecast in the

452
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:01,310
tutorials of the past two weeks in which the Gibs

453
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:07,160
after the Gibs paradox, his name also derived some

454
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:14,550
ago in the 70s for large and. We have seen that.

455
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,980
The entropy interpreter, the total of microstates

456
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,740
for dividing a certain amount of energy or a

457
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,590
certain number of particles into two. Subsystems

458
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,230
that have to add up to that same fixed amount. In

459
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,310
this case, too many particles is very nearly

460
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:39,740
saturated by the single case in which these energy

461
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,370
or particles is divided roughly evenly between

462
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:49,550
those two subsystems. So this was the reflection

463
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:56,300
of our intuition that it's much more likely to

464
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,800
find many particles in a ordinary looking smooth

465
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,660
distribution compared to a special unusual one,

466
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,340
even though. All those different microstates have.

467
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,720
Probability is given by the Boltzmann distribution.

468
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:19,450
So they are equal probabilities whenever those

469
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,350
entities are equal, there are just many more ways

470
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:27,410
of arranging. Particles when they are divided

471
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:30,170
roughly evenly and therefore many microstates to

472
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:36,710
pick up on. So this complicated expression. For.

473
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,720
The final interview that we are after can be

474
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,030
simplified by considering just the case in which

475
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:49,990
the. Two and particles are divided approximately

476
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:53,620
equally between those two subsystems or to take

477
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,780
the approximation to its limits instead are only

478
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:04,170
the case in which. That division is exact, you

479
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,850
sort of previewed or forecast, by the way, to the.

480
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:14,630
Drew. The thought experiment on this page, even

481
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:19,160
though the six particles that we have an

482
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,880
inclination to draw are not the largest number

483
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,210
where this approximation will become strictly

484
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:31,250
valid. But in this case, the calculation is easy

485
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:35,870
and it just boils down to the single possibility

486
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,160
for the number of particles in each system. In

487
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,330
fact, we don't even have to calculate observe that

488
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:49,640
once we have declared that the same number of

489
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,930
indistinguishable particles end up on either side

490
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:58,080
of the room, we separate the system to a private

491
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,860
domain to be from then something over all

492
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:04,800
microstates that those particles have at the same

493
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,480
boy v. to teeth gives us exactly the same

494
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,110
protection function. Hegel's three energy and

495
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,780
entropy as the original systems before we

496
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,950
separated them. So at the end of this process of

497
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,480
allowing two canonical systems to exchange

498
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,930
particles and then re separating them as had no

499
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,720
effect on the entropy, the final entropy

500
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,720
trajectory is exactly the same as the initial

501
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,590
entropy. Which we already computed was the same as

502
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:41,210
the entropy combined system. And this is where

503
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,520
there's a danger of oversimplifying.

504
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,720
Let's say that we didn't need to do the math at

505
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,160
all, we could just say that. OK, opening and

506
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,810
closing the door between two identical rooms is

507
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:59,540
not going to have any effect on the rehearsal

508
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,620
process that does not increase the total entropy.

509
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:10,670
Of the universe. The concept of reversibility is

510
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:15,620
connected to that if some process increases the

511
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,500
entropy, but it can't be exactly reversed to get

512
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,250
back to the original states, that would require a

513
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,880
reduction in entropy, which I suppose we will see

514
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,450
in more detail now if we switch our focus from the

515
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:33,500
individual case to the case of distinguishable

516
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:40,170
particles where the calculation is. Now, almost

517
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:45,360
the same. Looking at. The initial increase in

518
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,330
those two systems, A, B, and what happens when

519
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,810
they are combined into this system, C with twice

520
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,690
the volume and twice the number of particles

521
00:36:55,410 --> 00:37:00,310
instead of plugging in. Expression for the entropy

522
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:06,070
interchangeable particles we just have to use for

523
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:14,440
some. Equation for the civil case and the only

524
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,340
places that differ are five haves and three haves

525
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:23,500
and and the presence or absence of a factor in the

526
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:28,470
logarithm. And it is the. Second feature that

527
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:32,190
turns out to matter in this calculation of the

528
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,730
linear terms cancel out and this difference, as

529
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:42,040
does oil dependence on. This morning and. Deployed

530
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,730
wavelength. But we have here is no longer

531
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,500
effective end to end, cancel out the fact that the

532
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:54,090
two of the log that carries through and we find

533
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:59,720
that upon the first stage of this thought

534
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,900
experiment, removing the wall and allowing

535
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,090
particles to be exchanged between these two

536
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,330
subsystems in the case of distinguishable

537
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:12,830
particles, that produces an increase in the

538
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:18,110
entropy by this two and more two factor that.

539
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,360
Straightforward to compute based on her own work

540
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:28,130
today. So this positive increase in the energy

541
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:33,680
already level with a Delta mix, this is known as

542
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,500
the mixing entropy, essentially the increase in

543
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,750
number of possible microstates that we have to

544
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:46,370
account for when two gases of distinguishable

545
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:49,550
particles are mixed together. So this is also.

546
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,910
Essentially, what we would expect from the second

547
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:57,070
half of the interview is not not only remain not

548
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:01,230
decreasing, it has actively increased. But if we

549
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:06,050
go through the repeat the qualitative argument of

550
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,620
say that we expect an equal number of particles.

551
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:15,060
To end up in either of the two would be separate

552
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,040
the systems which this war has been put back in

553
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,020
place, that would be problematic. Because if it

554
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,050
were still the case that the initial to final

555
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,840
interviews were equal, then after increasing the

556
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,150
energy in the.

557
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:37,000
In the process of combining the systems, we would

558
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,060
need to decrease the energy to get back to that

559
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:44,620
starting point, which violates the second law, so

560
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:48,730
that that argumentation is what is called the gibs

561
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:52,540
paradox, which is maybe not entirely fair because.

562
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,300
Even as Gibbs was presenting this thought

563
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,480
experiment 150 years ago, you showed how there is,

564
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:05,700
in fact, no paradox. And. The explanation is.

565
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,690
Not the most complicated one is just the one where

566
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,630
you have to keep track carefully of how the

567
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:21,840
mathematics is proceeding, rather than relying on

568
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,120
intuition that, say, opening a door or involve

569
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,230
with two systems should be a reversal process with

570
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,630
no change in entropy.

571
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,720
And. Everybody knows mathematics, the fact that

572
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,110
the particles are now distinguishable means that

573
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:46,090
even though, as we've seen, we can expect. The

574
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,930
receptor in the system to be dominated by setups

575
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,990
where the particles are divided roughly evenly

576
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:57,310
between the two sides of the barrier, that is no

577
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:04,150
longer enough to establish that the final system

578
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:09,970
is identical to the initial system. Precisely due

579
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,420
to that distinction, we can tell we can label all

580
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,260
of the particles in that initial system, calling

581
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,610
them, say, A, B and C.

582
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,270
With lowercase letters and then in order to get

583
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:29,640
back to. Precisely the same microstates that we

584
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,850
have from these two initially separate systems up

585
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:37,860
here, you would also need to require that the same

586
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,950
sets of particles ended up on the same side of the

587
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:47,450
wall, which is not always the case. It is just as

588
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:51,770
likely, even with an even separation of the number

589
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:55,940
of particles to have different labels on different

590
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,180
sides of the wall, and all of that does have to be

591
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:04,390
accounted for in. The nasty sell over all the

592
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,530
possible microstates.

593
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:13,010
Even though we can still expect even numbers.

594
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,000
In particular, one of the possibilities that we

595
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,430
now have to sum over is, in fact, A, B, C, D, E, F

596
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:28,960
and so on, or ending up where they started off. So

597
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,710
that is. One contribution to the final entropy,

598
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,430
there will be many, many others that have really

599
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,820
large numbers that guarantees that the final

600
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,660
entropy will be created, that is not equal to what

601
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:49,660
we saw with. And if we do that calculation, which

602
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,740
is not really edifying to work through, we find

603
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,420
that the second law of all is obeyed. The entropy

604
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,180
is never decreasing and is always in general

605
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:09,060
increasing, not decreasing time. So the. There are

606
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:14,140
a few things to wrap up a few comments to. Make

607
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:19,330
about this to wrap up for today. Well, first,

608
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:22,950
maybe I should ask. The arguments, it's clear why.

609
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:29,270
You can. But into worries about a paradox, if you

610
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:32,830
were not sufficiently careful to enumerate

611
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,560
microstates and go through the mathematics that

612
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,410
really defines the entropy as opposed to.

613
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,590
Argumentation based on everything, intuition.

614
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,130
It's something to think about as well. Later on

615
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,870
today or over the weekend.

616
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,930
But this example also provides is another

617
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:10,380
illustration of another situation in which the

618
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,820
behavior of systems differs only due to the

619
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,330
intrinsic information content that they have. So

620
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:22,110
depending on whether or not we assume that the.

621
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,440
Particles in these two ideal gases we considered

622
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,250
are distinguishable, that each particle can be

623
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,400
labeled as labels can be tracked as the system

624
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,090
evolves and samples its microstates, that behaves

625
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,550
differently from the case in which those particles

626
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:41,470
are indistinguishable. It can't be

627
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,230
pulled apart in principle. There's no way of

628
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:52,030
attaching a label to them and saying that one

629
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:55,900
particular particle is distinct from any other.

630
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,550
And in particular, in the case of the sociability,

631
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:06,910
there is this positive mixing entropy when two

632
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:11,620
systems are allowed to work, when they are mixed,

633
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,530
they're brought together to exchange particles.

634
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:20,530
And that is in contrast to the case of the

635
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:23,080
individual distinguishable particles, which

636
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,290
behaves a bit more like you might expect from

637
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:29,910
everyday intuition. That argument of No.

638
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,670
Big effect coming from opening the doors to the

639
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:37,470
rooms or reversing that process by closing it

640
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:43,700
again. If we had of mixing between. Different

641
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,710
gases are distinguishable particles that change

642
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:52,170
could be coming from this positive mixing entropy.

643
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:58,080
Guarantees that the process itself cannot be

644
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:03,150
reversed. Doing so would imply a violation of the

645
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:08,190
second quarter and the take away message from here

646
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:11,310
is that the the second rule always wins. If you

647
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,680
think you find a way around it,

648
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,540
you should be skeptical of any claims to that

649
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:23,460
effect. So the process of mixing essential

650
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,030
particles, because it produces that increase in

651
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:31,050
entropy from the form of this mixing entropy, that

652
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:36,210
is an irreversible process. And the system cannot

653
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,920
be taken back to the starting point, even in

654
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,770
principle. Or perhaps we could have gotten here by

655
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,940
considering a different qualitative physical

656
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,810
argument that if we take, say, coffee cream and

657
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,840
mix those together, there is no way to

658
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:01,830
spontaneously separate the cream from the coffee

659
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,600
and get back to the initial stages by the time

660
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,930
evolution of the systems in the. Attempt to

661
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,960
separate those would require putting in a lot of

662
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,210
entropy to filter things into the two different

663
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,360
types of particles that have to mix there. That

664
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,250
even is a.

665
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,740
It's not quite a fully distinguishable article.

666
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:31,460
It's the case where we have two classes of

667
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,890
particles that are distinguishable between the

668
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:37,490
different classes within each class, but it is

669
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:43,190
perhaps a way of remembering the difficulty of the

670
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:48,650
physical picture of mixing entropy and mixing is

671
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,720
hard to do. So.

672
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,930
Given the time, it's not going to be worthwhile to

673
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,680
move on if the next section, so next week we will

674
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,540
start looking at pressure on the states and build

675
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,090
from that into thermodynamic cycles more generally

676
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:19,040
based on these ideal gases analyzed to sample

677
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:26,460
the sector. Your chance to look at the homework a

678
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,920
bit and talk about some of the. Nothing's really

679
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,230
changing. At the end of last week's tutorial, the

680
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:36,170
Instruments formula, the which obviously played a

681
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:40,040
significant role in the approximations brought to

682
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:46,100
bear on the process of mixing it to Eigil gases.

683
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:52,960
Are there any final questions before? We break for

684
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,310
the few hours. Before that, it was a real.

685
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:07,390
So I hope to see you all again this this afternoon.

686
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,330
Have.
