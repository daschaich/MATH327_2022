1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,660
All right, that's the recording started. And while

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,580
this camera hopefully

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,050
turns itself on and gets in focus, I can write down

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,160
the six-digit number for today that I have now recovered.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,900
Which is nine six eight five

6
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:38,830
one zero.

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,760
And let's see how the focus is

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,540
looking on this camera today.

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,020
That is clearly visible despite the bright sun from

10
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,680
outside, so let's pick up more or less where we

11
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,580
left off at the end of yesterday, touching in the

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,030
the big picture and the plan for the module. So we

13
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,750
spent a few weeks going through the canonical

14
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,220
ensemble, ideal gases and the use of those ideal gases

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,730
cycles to drive heat engines and refrigerators.

16
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,290
And we're going to set that aside and switch focus

17
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,090
to a different ensemble now. So before doing so,

18
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,850
just a quick call for any questions you want to

19
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,630
raise about the canonical example before we set it

20
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,300
aside for the time being and switch over to the

21
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,000
so-called grand canonical case.

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,630
Everyone seems content to move on the rank and

23
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:04,260
file review before diving into the details for

24
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,460
today, the progression of the modules so far that

25
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:14,500
after. Establishing the the basics was the basis

26
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,870
of the statistical foundation, the probability

27
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,660
space as a statistical ensemble consisting of the

28
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,050
microstates that a collection of particles or

29
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,690
degrees of freedom can adopt as they have all the

30
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,270
time. We first considered the specific probability

31
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,670
of on this micro canonical ensemble or we impose

32
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,250
constraints that number of particles in the system

33
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,230
were fixed as well as the internal energy of the

34
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,710
system. So this had a direct connection to

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,930
conservation of energy that required that the

36
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,450
system itself be completely isolated from its

37
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,530
environments and proved. Less than entirely useful

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,700
for practical applications, so we quickly moved on

39
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,030
to the canonical ensemble that we've been focusing

40
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,080
on up to and including yesterday, where now we

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,690
remove this constraint on the system, be

42
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,870
completely isolated if we allow it to exchange

43
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,770
energy with its environment and in place of that

44
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,470
conservation of energy in the system itself, the

45
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,460
overall requirements of conservation of energy in

46
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,380
the universe allows us to fix the temperature of

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,430
this system through that thermal contact with a

48
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:40,960
large external keypad for thermal reservoir. And

49
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,120
the comic ensemble, we still always count the

50
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,120
number of particles fixed and the generalization

51
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,120
we are diving into today and we'll be applying of

52
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,480
probably for the remainder of the time up until

53
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,870
the term break, is to remove the constraints that

54
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,230
the number of particles within the system remain

55
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,470
fixed, just as we earlier removed the constraint

56
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,090
on the energy within the system. Now imagine that

57
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,460
the system is able to exchange both particles and

58
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,350
energy with its surroundings. And in particular,

59
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,320
those surroundings in this form of the particle

60
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,050
reservoir that was briefly mentioned at the end of

61
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,380
yesterday is going to fix now not only the

62
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,720
temperature, but also a another quantity related

63
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,480
to the particle. No, in a similar way that the

64
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,360
temperature is related to the energy. So that is

65
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,480
what we. Begin with today by introducing and

66
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,160
declaring that the quality that will remain fixed

67
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,550
in the grand ensemble when the particle number and

68
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,140
internal energy or change is both the temperature.

69
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,530
And what is called the chemical potential, that

70
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,610
character you appeared on, the diagram I just had

71
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:00,850
up.

72
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,330
And we could have introduced this kind of

73
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,210
potential already back in the unit to when you

74
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,330
were talking about the micro economical ensemble,

75
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,440
we define temperature as a derived quantity on the

76
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,630
basis of. Specifying or controlling the internal

77
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,780
energy and number of particles we saw, the inverse

78
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,430
temperature was the response of the entropy to the

79
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,440
change of the energy with a fixed number of

80
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,970
particles the chemical potential is defined in.

81
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,160
The analogous way is interchanging the role of the

82
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,010
energy and particle number, so we consider the

83
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,640
response of the entropy of a system to a change of

84
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,850
particle. No, with the total internal energy of

85
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,180
that system fixed in this definition. We also have

86
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,770
this pre factor that. We will discuss and consider

87
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,620
what exactly it means and a bit of detail.

88
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,110
We have in addition to just that derivative, the

89
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,300
response of the interview to the huge particle

90
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,240
number through the factor of the negative

91
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,040
temperature so that the chemical potential and

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,870
temperature have the same dimensionality,

93
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,600
specifically the dimensions of energy in our

94
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,600
that's where those winds constitute a one.

95
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,150
Temperature and energy have the same dimensions.

96
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,740
Now, back in the case, the temperature, while this

97
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,400
definition in terms of a partial derivative was

98
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,880
not terribly intuitive, we have a sense of what

99
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,100
the temperature is, what it means, and how energy

100
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,010
we can expect to flow from hotter systems to

101
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,950
colder systems. The chemical potential, at least

102
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,340
if you're anything like me, you don't have a very

103
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,390
deeply ingrained intuition for what it means or

104
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,530
what it signifies. So let's go through some of its

105
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:08,050
properties in a bit carefully first during that.

106
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,510
In addition to having the same dimensions as the

107
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,210
temperature, it also has the same intrinsic

108
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,680
intensive properties. So if we take two systems

109
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,530
with the same chemical potential and combine them

110
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,840
into one system, that combined system twice the

111
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,990
size will have the same chemical potential as each

112
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,230
of those two subsystems, just like the temperature.

113
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,770
And in contrast to the particle, no matter what,

114
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,320
your entropy which increase as the size of the

115
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,550
system increases the chemical potential and

116
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,670
temperature. Are those fixed when we look at small

117
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,340
subsystems inside a larger system? And if we think

118
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,430
in a bit of detail about what this definition

119
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,300
really means, but what happens to the entropy when

120
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,540
we change the number of particles, we can conclude

121
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,780
that the chemical potential is generally negative.

122
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:13,140
Which is. Unlike the temperature. We can see this

123
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,520
by recalling that the entropy is, in a sense, a

124
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,560
measure of the amount of information that's

125
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,660
present in our system. A number of different ways

126
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,120
those particles can be arranged into different

127
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,630
microstates. If we add more particles, even if we

128
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,810
keep that overall energy fixed, they tend to be

129
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,420
more microstates, more ways of arranging those

130
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,690
particles and hence more information or more

131
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:44,320
entropy. So increasing that. Delta in the bottom

132
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,690
of the story that it leads to an increase in Delta

133
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,680
s implying that the partial derivative as a whole

134
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,050
is positive in general and then specializing to

135
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,580
so-called natural systems with positive

136
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,160
temperatures. We have a product to positive

137
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,960
quantities with a negative sign leading to you,

138
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:14,310
less than zero. And if we were to. Go back to

139
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:20,650
second unit, to the entropy we derived for the

140
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,440
spin system in the microeconomic ensembles and

141
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,350
carry out this derivative. We will see we will end

142
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,320
up with negative numbers for the chemical

143
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,020
potential and maybe it's worth saying before

144
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,130
moving on to justify this, that this is a

145
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,340
definition and in principle, we have a choice as

146
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,950
to how we define the chemical potential with or

147
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,780
without this negative side. So we want to justify

148
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,690
the choice that's being made here to keep the

149
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,070
chemical potential negative. We can do that by

150
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:06,360
thinking about. What happens if we take to some

151
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,070
systems, put them together and allow them to

152
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,920
exchange particles so there will be some net flow

153
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,970
of particles between two systems, just call them A

154
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,790
and B net. We will say have the same natural

155
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,540
positive temperature, but different values for

156
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,960
this partial derivative that is appearing in the

157
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,140
definition of the chemical potential. So say that

158
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,130
system has a larger value for that partial

159
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,380
derivative with the same temperature. That means

160
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,190
that the chemical potential in System A as a

161
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,060
negative value, that this order of magnitude and

162
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,770
the chemical potential of System B or in other

163
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,860
words, the chemical potential for system is less

164
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:56,360
than that of System B. So let me know if any of

165
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,190
the. Inequality is coming up here are not

166
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,950
immediately clear.

167
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,470
And what we want to do is apply that second law of

168
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,100
thermodynamics to the situation and think about

169
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,030
what happens to the total and total entropy of

170
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,890
these two systems if particles are allowed to flow

171
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,880
between them from one to the other.

172
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,960
So if the number of state bills and particles are

173
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,560
added to the system, A, we can see that that will

174
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,790
lead to an increase in the entropy system made

175
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,390
just by the product of those additional particles

176
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,510
times this partial derivative. And since we

177
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,300
started off by saying that the response of the

178
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,450
entropy particle numbering system was larger than

179
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,980
System B, we see that the change in the entropy is

180
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,450
this debate for A given fixed number of particles

181
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,860
flowing into it is going to be larger than if that

182
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,600
same. A number of articles for editors just to be.

183
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,290
So if we. Talk about a flow of particles, we have

184
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,170
to remove particles from one of these systems in

185
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,890
order to add them to the other system. So the

186
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,600
effect of the effect on the entropy of adding

187
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,060
removing those particles from System A. is going

188
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,660
to be larger than that of adding removing them to

189
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,440
System B,

190
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,170
which means that the only way these particles

191
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,530
could flow from one system to the other,

192
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,210
consistent with the second alternate universe, is

193
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:53,370
to flow from System B with the smaller partial

194
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,730
derivative to system a bit the larger partial

195
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,900
derivative that ensures that more entropy is

196
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,450
gained from the addition of the particles, a

197
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,440
system that is removed by the removal of those

198
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,070
particles from the big. So the. That entropy in

199
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:17,270
the universe increases in this process as it must

200
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:23,210
by perceptible dynamics and connectedness to the

201
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,280
different chemical potentials that we have. We see

202
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,070
that the particles are flowing from System B. With

203
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:35,230
the larger chemical potential to system A with the

204
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,870
smaller value, the chemical potential, which is

205
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,450
the same sort of behavior as we would expect for

206
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,210
the flow of heat between systems of different

207
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,060
temperatures, keets or energy flows from the

208
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,280
system, the higher temperature to the system at

209
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,270
the lower temperature. With our choice of negative

210
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,840
sign and the definition of chemical potential, we

211
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,960
now see particles flowing from systems with larger

212
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,540
chemical potentials to systems with smaller

213
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,530
chemical potentials.

214
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,420
And the only wrinkle to keep track of is the fact

215
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:18,690
that we draw this potential on the line here, the

216
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,940
fact that the chemical potentials are negative in

217
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,480
general needs to be on the smaller value in this

218
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,830
case, a as a larger magnitude zero. There would be

219
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,870
the particles are flowing from larger chemical

220
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,910
potentials, smaller chemical potentials. But

221
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,510
because of that, or thanks to the negative sign in

222
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,180
the definition, guarantees that the larger

223
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,330
magnitude for the chemical potential is a smaller

224
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:57,160
number with the overall negative sign. So while we

225
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,590
could have made the choice to make the chemical

226
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:03,070
potential positive in our definition, that would

227
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,310
have led to the opposite behavior systems long

228
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,160
from smaller chemical potentials to larger

229
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:15,040
chemical potentials. And that raises the dilemma

230
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,120
of keeping track of opposite behavior for our

231
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,040
energy and particles flow in terms of temperature

232
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,740
and chemical potential that we avoid by making the

233
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,490
chemical potential negative. So. Now that we have

234
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,970
at least some insight into the chemical potential,

235
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,180
we can more formally define the grand canonical

236
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,870
ensemble. So just as in the case of the Michael

237
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,320
canonical canonical ensembles, it is a statistical

238
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,290
ensemble, a probability space of microstates

239
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:50,550
sampled by the system as it evolves in time. Now,

240
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,850
the number of particles and the internal energy of

241
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,360
the system is allowed to fluctuate, and the two

242
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,300
things that are kept fixed in your place are the

243
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,440
temperature and the chemical potential. And both

244
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,520
of those are fixed through contact with that large

245
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,700
external reservoir that is now a particle

246
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,760
reservoir. I'll be going beyond the thermal

247
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,670
reservoir that we considered in the canonical case

248
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,480
to questions about chemical potential and the

249
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,410
definition of an ensemble that we have here.

250
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,840
Not hearing any we can, actually. Perhaps he'll

251
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,200
pretty quickly through this next section.

252
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,860
Producing the economic competition function,

253
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,050
because a lot of this is going to be a pretty

254
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,500
close analogy to what we did to put the canonical

255
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,510
ensemble on a solid mathematical foundation. We're

256
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:11,100
doing qualitatively or spiritually the same thing

257
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:16,240
in the grand canonical case. Which is by

258
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,490
introducing an Xbox for the form of this particle

259
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,260
reservoir with which our system of interest can

260
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,920
exchange both particles and energy and then

261
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,680
showing that the form of the reservoir is

262
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,620
ultimately irrelevant in the probability space.

263
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,960
That results, we can then work directly with that

264
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,180
probability space, the system we're interested in

265
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,500
without saying or knowing anything about the

266
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,880
details of the reservoir that are that is fixing

267
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,720
its temperature and chemical potential. So we do

268
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,310
the same thing, the same idea as an economical

269
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,230
case, the so-called replica trick, where we

270
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,780
imagine that the overall system that combines our

271
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,750
system of interest, America, with this large

272
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,710
particle reservoir just consists of a large number

273
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:17,530
of copies of that system of interest. So before we

274
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:23,500
had an economical case, we had the same idea where.

275
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,220
We imagined they taken the air in this room,

276
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,280
putting it into a closed beaker of the Sports

277
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,560
Illustrated in this cartoon and then allowing for

278
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,010
seeing what would happen to that combined system

279
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:45,440
of Omega and its reservoir as they were all in

280
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,650
thermodynamic equilibrium and all allowed to

281
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,650
exchange energy with each other. In this case, we

282
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,800
are dispensing with that beaker. We can

283
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,110
essentially declare that our system of interest as

284
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,010
an example is some cubic centimeter of air in this

285
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:05,090
room and the particle reservoir is the rest of the

286
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,140
room. So particles can flow freely into and out of

287
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,690
that system of interest taking energy along with

288
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:18,170
them. And we want to analyze that overall system

289
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,400
in the framework of the microeconomic ensemble as

290
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,220
its full energy and tool particle number are

291
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,650
concerned. So these are total energy that comes

292
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:35,510
from these are copies or replicas of our system of

293
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:39,620
interest. So it is a visual.

294
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,280
Illustration of the setup.

295
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,860
Similar to the spin system that we had the first

296
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,530
time we did the replica trick, we now have a bunch

297
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,440
of replicas of our system of interest, which we

298
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,900
can declare to be this one in the center. And in

299
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,930
addition to allowing energy to be exchanged

300
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,810
between any and all of these replicas of the

301
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:09,620
individual particles in them can also be swapped.

302
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,340
Between. The various replicas, but the system

303
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,580
itself and those that form the overall reservoir.

304
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:24,010
And and for simplicity, let's say that all of

305
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,860
these particles are indistinguishable, so we don't

306
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,310
have to keep track of which particle is in which

307
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:34,600
replica. We only have to care about the total

308
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,980
number of particles in the total amount of energy

309
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,680
that they have and the microstates of the system

310
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,400
of interest that they happen to be in 40

311
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,700
microstates of the overall. Many replicate system.

312
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,510
Charging through with a few more details about the

313
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,010
setup.

314
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,250
We are going to assume that. The small system

315
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,000
we're interested in, the single replica in this

316
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,840
collection, has some number of possible

317
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,000
microstates and we define the overall microstates

318
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,300
of the system of our replicas in terms of how many

319
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,230
of those replicas are in any particular

320
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,740
microstates of that small system. So this is

321
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,250
exactly the same idea that we went through in Unit

322
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:44,420
three to define the canonical ensemble. We. Define

323
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,310
the occupation numbers and corresponding

324
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:52,440
occupation probabilities, we're. For each of these

325
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,510
microstates, Omega III of the single replica small

326
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:02,250
system, there are in the total number of replicas

327
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,700
in that particular micro state. So the overall

328
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,410
number of replicas is just the sum over all of

329
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:15,330
these occupation numbers. And normalizing those

330
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,900
occupation numbers by the total number of replicas

331
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,110
gives the occupation ability, the probability that

332
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,040
if we look at the overall system, pick some

333
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:30,750
replica at random in the collection, it will be in

334
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,500
this particular microstates eye with probability

335
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,570
piece by.

336
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,260
And this analogy to what we did with the thermal

337
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,130
reservoir case is direct enough that we can

338
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,810
already write down some results for derived

339
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,670
quantities of this overall total system of RF,

340
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,270
because we know that the total number of

341
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,630
microstates is just the number of ways of.

342
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,080
Selecting or assigning all of the occupation

343
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,910
probabilities and one up to an end to the are

344
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,880
different replicas. So that's an hour factorial

345
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,870
divided by the product of an vectorial and two

346
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,870
factorial all the way up to and seven factorial.

347
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:27,710
And the logarithm of that gives us the entropy or

348
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:32,320
the overall system, which. Looks a lot like the

349
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,200
entropy for. A single system with an overall

350
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,350
factor of multiplying the sum over P4P for all of

351
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:47,430
the occupation probabilities where we have to get

352
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,270
things in this form, a plan, Serling's formula.

353
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,270
For both our and every one of the occupation

354
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,230
numbers, so there.

355
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,790
The total number of replicas needs to be extremely

356
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,900
large in order to have a large occupation number

357
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,190
for every single microstates of the small system.

358
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,060
The. Really, the only difference in the set up so

359
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,500
far is that these different microstates of our

360
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,780
small system now are allowed to involve different

361
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,720
numbers of particles in addition to different

362
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,840
energies. So is that set up clear before we dive

363
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,060
into the calculation that. We have to do with it.

364
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:50,580
Let's keep continuing like we did in the canonical

365
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,200
case. What we want to do is, again, to determine

366
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:00,830
the temperature. Of not only the overall system,

367
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,040
but because the temperature is intensive. The

368
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,800
temperature will be the same for our small system

369
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,590
of interest within this large reservoir. The new

370
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,370
ingredient is that we also want to determine the

371
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,670
chemical potential of the overall system. These

372
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,730
are the two qualities that are going to be kept

373
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:25,140
fixed by contact with this large part of the

374
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,130
reservoir. And from the definition of temperature

375
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,410
and chemical potential that we started off with

376
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:37,020
today, we see that we need to first determine the

377
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,800
entropy of the overall total system, take partial

378
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,920
derivatives with respect to energy and particle

379
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,940
number, and that will give us the two quantities

380
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,590
we're after that we want to. Keep fixed and.

381
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,790
As always, when determining the entropy

382
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:04,210
corresponding to the dynamic equilibrium for this

383
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:09,280
large system, we have to maximize the entropy,

384
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,530
declare that, identify some dynamic equilibrium as

385
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,280
the condition where the entropy is saturating its

386
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,370
maximum value. The longer has space to increase

387
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:25,510
further into the second life. And we now have

388
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,350
three different constraints that need to be

389
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:34,270
satisfied in order to or in the process of

390
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,420
maximizing this entropy to these constraints we've

391
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,930
seen before. Back in the canonical case, the

392
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,140
occupation probabilities, in order to be actual

393
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,940
probabilities, have to sum up to one hundred

394
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:52,500
percent. And the total energy. Of the overall

395
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:57,280
micro canonical collection of replicas. So the son

396
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,660
has an extensive quantity over the energy of each

397
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,100
replica. This has to remain fixed at this fixed

398
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:11,170
value, the total and doing the same trick as we

399
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:14,920
expressing the total energy, not as the sum over

400
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,560
all our replicas, but is the sum overall in

401
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,140
microstates of the small system we did by the

402
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,680
occupation numbers. We end up with an expression

403
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,160
for that total energy in terms of the occupation

404
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,400
probabilities and the energy of each microstates

405
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,250
of the system we're interested in. So that is

406
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,850
exactly what we had back in the three and we

407
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,130
defined the canonical ensemble and the new

408
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:47,220
ingredients. Is playing the same game or the total

409
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,430
number of particles amongst all of these are

410
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:54,300
replicas which just swaps the energy for particle

411
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,140
no in all of these and microstates of the small

412
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,670
system.

413
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:04,680
So, in fact, this. Constraints on the part of the

414
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,940
number is the new ingredient that will affect the

415
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:16,760
maximization of the entropy. So adding to the. To

416
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,260
the knowledge multipliers that we had worked with

417
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,460
previously is a constraint on the. Total

418
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,460
probability to be one hundred percent and negative

419
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,910
beta, I should say, that's alpha negative beta.

420
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:35,590
It's raising the total energy in this combination

421
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,170
of system plus reservoir. We have this third grant

422
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:44,800
multiplier in the form of GIMA that accounts for

423
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:48,190
the constraints on the total number of particles

424
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,480
compared to the occupation probabilities for each

425
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,440
of the microstates.

426
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:00,810
And having set things up in this way, the partial

427
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:05,340
derivative of this modified entropy in order to.

428
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,640
Maximizers. Is fairly straightforward. Remember,

429
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,430
the derivative of peace of iron with respect to a

430
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:20,030
piece of cake, is that her delta of like so it

431
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:24,960
picks out the microscale whose occupation

432
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,390
probability we are taking the derivative with

433
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:32,090
respect to and in the first term. Of the modified

434
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,180
entropy, picking up a Delta IC and something over

435
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,150
gives us that overall factor of minus our times,

436
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,190
one of the

437
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:50,580
Delta picking out the key term. In that sum, the

438
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,790
derivative of the log itself is one over.

439
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,520
Which cancels out with the PKK in to leave just

440
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:06,690
one. Similarly, we have a delta to some number I

441
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,490
multiplied by Alpha, just gives us Alpha Times one.

442
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:17,780
We have. L.A. Times are a similar delta now

443
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,270
multiply that by the energy, so the energy of the

444
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,930
microstates and then finally. The new ingredient

445
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:32,960
is gametime are with the Delta and some number I'd

446
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:37,990
give and take so isolating in this expression that

447
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,110
is equal to zero the.

448
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,690
The only term that depends on the occupation

449
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:50,620
probability we lose. Everything else, the other

450
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,560
side, the buy through by negative, are so that is

451
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,300
a negative one from the term in parentheses. Plus,

452
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,680
alpha over our military hours in the final two

453
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,120
terms, so we just keep the beta

454
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:16,940
gamma and in other words, the occupation itself is

455
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,920
the exponential of these four terms.

456
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:32,910
We can we organize, as we did before, into. Ratio.

457
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:39,310
Of the two factors that depend on. The internal

458
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,400
energy and political number for corresponding

459
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,480
microstates divided by the.

460
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:54,270
Negative of the first two terms or one minus Alpha

461
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:59,580
over. That is makes no explicit reference to the

462
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:03,390
Microsoft case that we are interested in and we

463
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,060
can define a new

464
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,230
parameter. Is that supposed to be this exponential

465
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:19,770
factor in the denominator? Keeping the. Other

466
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,020
exponentially as they are.

467
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,560
So we can replace my handwriting with equation

468
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,480
sixty nine, which should match what we just

469
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,790
computed where.

470
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:42,040
Instead, somebody will be identified as the dragon

471
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,590
on the competition function that gave this section

472
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:49,330
its title is a direct expression of one of the

473
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,550
original advice multipliers that we started off

474
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:56,800
with. And that leaves us with a set of free

475
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,000
parameters that we are currently working in. And

476
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:05,440
again, the same procedure as when we did the

477
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,930
replica trick for the canonical ensemble without

478
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,360
appli each of those three constraints in order to

479
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,770
fix each of these three parameters, declaring that.

480
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,600
All those constraints are satisfied, the

481
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,210
probabilities are well defined, probabilities

482
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,260
getting to one, and similarly, the total amount of

483
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,680
energy and the total number of particles are all

484
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,530
accounted for among.

485
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,750
It was 10 seconds. That was a test. So we are

486
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,560
going through the three constraints to fix the

487
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,520
three parameters coming out of our maximisation of

488
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,030
the entropy to identify thermodynamic equilibrium.

489
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,340
And in that way, define the canonical partition

490
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:17,360
function. Now, the first of these constraints is

491
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,810
the easy one, summing over all of these

492
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,890
probabilities in the form that we have now derived.

493
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,960
And declaring that the result adds up to one

494
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,910
hundred percent, that is this. One over ZG out

495
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:41,750
front and then the exponential factor that depends

496
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,190
on the microstates by the speed times, the energy

497
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,070
plus gamma times, the particle number. And we can

498
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,960
stop there because the statement that this some

499
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,540
adds up to one immediately tells us that if we

500
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:04,330
move this. Partition function to the other side of

501
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:09,070
the equation is just equal to that sum over the

502
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,300
exponential factors.

503
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,540
They'd be in jail in nine.

504
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:25,890
The other two constraints are. A bit messy to deal

505
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,420
with. We want to.

506
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,490
Recalling the overall goal of determining the

507
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:37,370
temperature and chemical potential from personal

508
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:43,220
evidence of the entropy with respect to the total

509
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,950
energy and number of particles governed by the

510
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,840
micro canonical ensemble in this.

511
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:56,090
Roughly, Colacello. We want to relate these two

512
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:00,080
parameters, be that, again, to those toll particle

513
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:04,190
number and total internal energy, which we can

514
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,010
immediately do by playing in the value that we

515
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:12,760
derived for. The economical protection function in

516
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,700
terms of being so.

517
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,440
In these expressions, if the overall picture are

518
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,980
we have the total energy given by the sun over the

519
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,700
micro probability is times under the microscope

520
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,030
internal energy or particle? No. Those.

521
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:38,570
Probabilities now are exponential factor divided

522
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,650
by some of that exponential factor overall,

523
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,720
microstates I'll use different.

524
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,290
Indices for the two songs in the numerator

525
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:53,560
denominator here, so we just have this complicated

526
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:58,270
expression, much as we had back in Unit two, that

527
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:03,550
in principle relates the total energy and particle

528
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:10,330
number to beta and gamma in. Fairly opaque ways.

529
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,800
Having written this down, that we might as well

530
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,740
simplify things for you.

531
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,470
Have identified some of the denominator as one

532
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:27,600
over ZG, that's another coopetition function. And

533
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:34,830
if we note that the. Terms of time, this

534
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:37,950
exponential factor is equal to the partial

535
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,710
derivative of that exponential with respect to

536
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:43,770
give up. That would bring down the specter of

537
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,340
supply. And analogously, if you wanted to bring

538
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,280
down a factor of supply, that could take a partial

539
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,700
derivative of each exponential term with respect

540
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,650
to negative data.

541
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:03,350
We can see them that. Once we sum over all of

542
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:08,430
those parts of Riverdale's. The partial derivative

543
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,410
is a one year operation, we can take it outside

544
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:15,260
the sun and end up with another factor of the sum

545
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:19,530
of all microstates of our extensional the minus

546
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:25,810
nine, which is the protection function. So overall,

547
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:31,090
we have an expression relating to the total energy

548
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:35,530
to the negative derivative with respect to data of

549
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,950
the logarithm of this particular function as a

550
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:45,280
function of gamma. And similarly, the total number

551
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,150
of particles is related to the derivative of that

552
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:54,010
same log. That's the key factor with respect to

553
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,110
the other three parameter gamma.

554
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:03,690
So that is going to be useful in just a bit.

555
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,450
Hopefully something we'll get to today before

556
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:09,960
Friday.

557
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,460
And the next step in getting to. The end goal of

558
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:25,380
our calculation is to. Write down this expression

559
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,820
for the entropy now in terms of the total energy

560
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,260
and total particle number. This is the quantity

561
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,330
whose derivatives we're going to take in order to

562
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,050
define the temperature and chemical potential for

563
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,750
both the reservoir and the system that is in

564
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,700
contact with that particle reservoir.

565
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,770
So the quick way of filling in this calculation is

566
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:56,500
only plugging in the result we've derived for one

567
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,360
of these factors of the occupation probability and

568
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,510
keep the other one.

569
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:04,860
Hanging around.

570
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:13,620
And let's see what to do is put a parenthesis

571
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,750
there when want take the word. Out of this

572
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,720
equation, six, nine at the top of the page, the

573
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,640
first turn will be the negative log of ZG. So I

574
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:30,710
should have left room for. The negative sign.

575
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:39,680
There, then we break up the exponential sum into

576
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,040
the product of exponential technological both,

577
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:48,380
which just leaves the argument lightning speed up

578
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:52,370
the gamma and I.

579
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,110
And.

580
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:03,540
We can see that the Lord of ZG is independent of

581
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,150
the individual microstates or something over, so

582
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,850
all that is left for this term in that song is

583
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:11,160
just the sum of the probabilities themselves,

584
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,300
which is one you end up with two negative signs,

585
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:20,610
three positive. Our Lord ZG. We have a negative

586
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:27,600
beina times negative are so plus beta, and then

587
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,390
what's left is our times, the sum over all

588
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:33,900
microstates of the occupation, provability times,

589
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:37,530
the internal energy for those microstates, which

590
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:37,920
is.

591
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,350
This factor we have.

592
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,580
Very nearly on the page, but not quite. Which is

593
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:52,000
to say that some gives us the total energy

594
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:57,580
multiplying data. And similarly now, with the

595
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,430
negative sign for the game, the total number of

596
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,630
particles from the song of occupation probability

597
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:09,890
times. The number of particles in each microstates

598
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,750
of the small system of interest,

599
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:14,990
so.

600
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:22,420
All you need to do with this is now take the

601
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:29,990
derivatives with respect to both. The total energy,

602
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:34,190
as well as the total particle number that defines

603
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:39,850
the temperature. And the chemical potential, the

604
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:43,210
temperatures, the familiar one to start off with.

605
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:49,050
So the derivative of the first term with respect

606
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:52,020
to the energy has this cost factor of all of the

607
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:56,760
number of refixed comes out front. And then I want

608
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:03,700
to recall that this. ZG is a great economic

609
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,030
competition, function is really a function of both

610
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:12,220
beta and Gamma. That in turn related to the total

611
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:18,040
energy. So going through the chain rule in this

612
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,750
computation, we can look at the derivative with

613
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:27,130
respect to energy. And just to save my wrist, I

614
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:30,610
will leave off the subscripts. This will be the

615
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,450
total energy in this computation. And we can pass

616
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:41,830
that through to the derivative of. The slogan of

617
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,590
ZG with respect to Baida and similarly the.

618
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:50,820
Derivative with respect to Yeva.

619
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:58,410
And to read carefully, to distinguish it from that

620
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:02,740
partial derivative, some. The second term, we have

621
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,510
the derivative of.

622
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,550
Beta with respect to energy.

623
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,030
Plus, the grid of energy with respect to energy,

624
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:19,330
which has just been itself, and then finally. The

625
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:21,820
total number of particles times that derivative of

626
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,850
gamma with respect to the energy

627
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,890
and now these equations, 1771, are proving useful.

628
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:39,490
We have that the derivative of looks at G with

629
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:44,320
respect to data. Times are is the negative of the

630
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:49,620
total energy. It's minus E. Leaving off that

631
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,800
subscription, similarly, the derivative with

632
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,800
respect, given the times are going to give us

633
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:03,960
positive N. So overall, we have. Derivatives of

634
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,600
data with respect to energy.

635
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,880
Focus has gone funny down there.

636
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:16,920
That comes with the factor of minus E you have.

637
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:22,260
Derivative of gamma with respect to energy. Times

638
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:27,420
a positive and the plus the other three terms from

639
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:34,980
the previous line. He debated the. Beta and minus

640
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,990
10 gigabit,

641
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,360
which simplifies very nicely the E times positive

642
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,140
and negative, he began with the E times positive

643
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:55,410
and negative NP and all that is left here. It is

644
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:56,550
just data.

645
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:05,730
So we have found, in short, that. This Legrange

646
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:09,560
parameter around multiplier data is identified

647
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,040
with the inverse temperature through this replica

648
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,570
trick, this process of.

649
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,560
Maximizing the modified entropy and imposing

650
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,770
constraints on the internal the total internal

651
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,680
energy of our our replicator system.

652
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,090
And.

653
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,870
Do we have time to go through the. Similar

654
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:43,240
arguments. In terms of the chemical potential.

655
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,710
We might, but maybe that would be a good place to

656
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:52,310
pick up on Friday, this is a way of checking in

657
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:55,250
and reminding where we are, what we're doing to.

658
00:46:56,370 --> 00:47:00,270
To get going with the remainder of the setup of

659
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:05,730
the grand canonical ensemble. So give us a chance

660
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:09,930
to review this calculation of what it means. Are

661
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:13,200
there any questions that have come up about it up

662
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,050
to this point?

663
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,470
And we have a few days off to think about it.

664
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,440
We'll pick up and possibly get through the

665
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:30,040
formulation and into some applications of the

666
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,490
canonical ensemble that I see you next on Friday

667
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:37,750
morning. So. Take care of them.

668
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,430
I'll see you later this week.
