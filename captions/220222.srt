1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,580
Well, about time we get going once more.  I suppose

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,370
we won't have to deal with the issue of too much sun

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,230
causing a glare on the screen today. Though,

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,760
overall, I would have preferred that to walking in

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,980
from Wavertree in this weather.  Let's see...

6
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,390
Several things are going wrong at a technical

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,000
level at the moment. So the last person in this

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,910
room yesterday didn't plug in that little microphone.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,870
So I hope that those who are connected remotely

10
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,620
can hear me through the built-in one sticking out

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:50,890
of the table.  The printing system also went down

12
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,750
yesterday. So we'll have to use my digital paper

13
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,340
here to keep track of what's going on, and look at

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,140
what that six-digit code for you is today.

15
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:19,210
So the magic number is six two five five one four

16
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:26,200
What I've put up on the screen is the tail end of what

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,340
we were talking about yesterday, wrapping up. Unit

18
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,470
three on the canonical ensemble, which I did rush

19
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,080
through a bit at the end just to get to that, to

20
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,670
bring in stopping points of wrapping up that whole

21
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,580
unit. And the particular one thing I forgot to

22
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,290
mention at the time was that in order to. Have a

23
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,250
non-zero value for the symbolic high temperature

24
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,300
limits of the indistinguishable entropy, which is

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,150
the slogan plus one, when everything normalize by

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,650
and for the purposes of this plot, that number of

27
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,380
spins is being set to fall. And you can check that

28
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,520
compared to the log to one quarter log, five is

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,630
about two thirds as large, matching the numerical

30
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,190
value shown here. That doesn't affect the. I mean,

31
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,240
qualitative message to take away that just by

32
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,330
changing our assumptions about whether the

33
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,290
particles in a system are distinguishable or not,

34
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,170
which is to say by adjusting our assumptions about

35
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,250
how much information is available about those

36
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,460
particles in principle, independent of whatever

37
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,730
technology we might have to distinguish between

38
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,540
them, if in principle, in any way they can be

39
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,060
distinguished. There's there are clear effects

40
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,510
both on the entropy as well as the internal energy

41
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,770
of that system. And that will cause we will

42
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,970
continue seeing similar things as we move on into.

43
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,960
Some of the more traditional playgrounds for the

44
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,100
physical POSIX, but before doing that, I'll ask if

45
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,160
any questions have come to mind. Now that you've

46
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,930
had a few hours to think about what we looked at

47
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,570
yesterday, especially that bit at the end. That

48
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,070
was a little rushed.

49
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,440
And up here in the room, Moore was connected

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,360
remotely. We will.

51
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,780
Move on to a second application of the canonical

52
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,400
ensemble. So, again, fixing the temperature

53
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
through a thermal ensemble, fixing the number of

54
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,340
particles and considering an.

55
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,380
Bit more length and more detail the. Topic of

56
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:09,270
ideal gases and what ideal means is one of the

57
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,050
objectives to start off with specifying the

58
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,780
systems to. To consider in this unit, so it's a

59
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,680
bit more a bit less trivial application compared

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,640
to just the speed systems to keep things.

61
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,270
Reasonably simple to start off with. We will

62
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,890
specialize this focus to ideal gases that are both

63
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,450
classical and non relativistic and I'm not sure,

64
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,730
given the. Different sets of modules that you may

65
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,700
have taken before now, how familiar all of this

66
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,750
terminology may be. So just to review it and feel

67
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,060
free to ask for

68
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,280
further elaboration if if you wanted the classical

69
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,880
systems just means that we are ignoring any

70
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,850
effects of quantum mechanics or classical is not

71
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,380
quantum. And that's easy to say. It has some

72
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,390
subtle consequences, one of which being that you

73
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,390
can imagine. We can specify both the position and

74
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,560
momentum of every particle in the gas with

75
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,080
arbitrary precision, which is not the case.

76
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,910
Quantum mechanically and I guess implicit in my

77
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,940
use of three vectors for position and momentum is

78
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,130
the idea that we'll be looking at these gases in

79
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,060
some three dimensional space. And not relativistic

80
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,330
particles, similarly, that we ignore effects due

81
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,060
to relativity, both special and general.

82
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,780
In this context of Agassiz, this means that the

83
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,800
particles in this gas are moving relatively slowly

84
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,190
where the relatively is taking a comparison to the

85
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,770
speed of light. Three hundred million meters per

86
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,620
second, which means that the energies of each of

87
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,640
these particles is just going to be given by the

88
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,880
expression that came out of Newton's laws of

89
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,650
motion all the way back in the sixteen hundreds.

90
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:23,720
But the energy is. What happened V squared B is

91
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,780
the velocity of the movie is the momentum. So we

92
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,290
end up with energy use for each particle that have

93
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,410
the momentum squared of that particle, the product

94
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,520
of those three vectors divided by twice the mass

95
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,030
of the particle, which we. We can assume is now

96
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,560
zero and it turns out that having a relatively

97
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,040
heavy mass is equivalent to particles moving with

98
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,220
speed, small compared to the speed of light might

99
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,920
be massless particles. And finally, ideally, Gas's,

100
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,360
which is the the big one that comes in, that the

101
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,190
title of the unit just says that these particles

102
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,240
in this gas are not interacting with each other.

103
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,110
In other words, the total energy of a system of

104
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,420
any gas particles and molecules we think of.

105
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,710
Absolutely. The air in a room is just the sum over

106
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,710
the energies of those individual particles with

107
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,770
their individual momentum. So how does a factor of

108
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,890
one over two and all the particles have the same

109
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,510
mass? And then to sum over all of the moment to

110
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:45,430
squared, so that is the statement of the system

111
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,190
will be considering. Are there any objections to

112
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,880
the classical and non relativistic terminology?

113
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,070
Having well, there is one more piece of

114
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,530
information to specify about the system. In

115
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,660
addition to the gasping and thermodynamic

116
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,540
equilibrium, what we will be assuming from now on.

117
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,750
And he fixed temperature. We will be assuming that

118
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,900
the gas is in some volume, a box that again for

119
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,420
simplicity, will it take to be a cube and the

120
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,780
three dimensional space, the total volume that is

121
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,760
L cubed, where L is the length of that box on each

122
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,680
side. So given the specification of the system and

123
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,830
in particular of the energy of that system, the

124
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,160
starting point for an analysis of the kinetic

125
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:47,260
ensemble is to determine the canonical protection

126
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,950
function, some overall microstates of the

127
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,930
exponential function, the Boltzmann factor. That

128
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,840
depends on the total energy of that microstates,

129
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,320
something overall and particles normalized by the

130
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:04,120
temperature. And this. Computing the summer

131
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,870
requires. Figuring out what the microstates are to

132
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:17,260
some over and if we. Did the intuitive thing and

133
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,600
just said that. These momentum three vectors for

134
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,600
each particle, we assume can be.

135
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,610
Determined with arbitrary precision so they can be.

136
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,840
Viewed as a triple loop continuously, very real

137
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,310
numbers, that is problematic in this context,

138
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,880
because real numbers, as we know, are an

139
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,320
uncomfortably infinite set. And if we have a set

140
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,020
of microstates, then essentially, by definition,

141
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,960
it is impossible to count. Those microstates

142
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,490
through this discreet, some over them estimation

143
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,780
would be ill-Defined if we were to assume that all

144
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:11,200
the men were continuously variable. So to avoid

145
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,770
that issue and recover a well-defined. Economic

146
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,360
competition function for statistical analysis, we

147
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,240
need to it's called regulate the system or

148
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,880
sometimes called regularizing the system for those

149
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,810
who prefer extra syllables. What we can say is

150
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,990
that rather than having those moments of being

151
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,900
continuously variable, we can posit that the

152
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:43,420
momentum can only adopt some set of discrete,

153
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:49,120
quantized values that we further assume depend on

154
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,980
the volume of the box that they are contained in.

155
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:57,580
Now.

156
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,870
Is to be specific, before going on to commentary.

157
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,950
What this does is takes that momentum three vector

158
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:16,190
and recasts it as. A. Triplet of integers, X, Y, Z,

159
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,090
with some dimension for every factor that carries

160
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,300
the dimensions of the matter, that attaches them

161
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,400
to these integers.

162
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,620
The. A key feature of this factor is this constant,

163
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,600
which is an age with a slash through it known as H

164
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:45,420
Bar or the reduced Planck constant. Which converts

165
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,930
those units from that inverse length normalize by

166
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,680
PI to units of momentum. And.

167
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,790
If you have seen quantum mechanics before him,

168
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,100
they will recognize this as cauterizes quantum

169
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,160
mechanically. It is the particle in the box

170
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,550
problem that is the starting point for a lot of

171
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:13,850
quantum mechanics modules. But for the purposes of

172
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,160
this module, we don't have to assume quantum

173
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,050
mechanics or any knowledge about it, we can take

174
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:22,080
this as an island, which. In fact, it's similar to

175
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,690
the spirit in which Max Planck introduced his

176
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:30,210
constant and a similar sort of hypothesis more

177
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,430
than a decade before quantum mechanics was was

178
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,960
really formalized. He saw that. Regularization of

179
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,970
the sort had to be required to avoid.

180
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,170
Nonsensical predictions from considering certain

181
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,030
physical systems and just to make sure that the

182
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,870
meaning of this equation forty seven is clear can

183
00:12:53,770 --> 00:13:01,290
write down the energies that result so. For a

184
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07,340
given. Integer vector k corresponding energy is OK

185
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:13,000
is just that momentum over to M, which brings in a

186
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,410
factor that each of our squared pi squared over to

187
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,480
and elsewhere and that factor then we enter

188
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:27,430
product of. X to Y. And casette

189
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,450
and. If I just write that Cowslip Prefecture, each

190
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,440
Achbar Square pipe over to that now as some script

191
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:38,860
E!

192
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,490
You can. Check that this makes sense by.

193
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,530
Considering what possible set of energies are

194
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,310
possible with this onsets, so all energy is have

195
00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:00,020
this overall pretty factor of the these cases are

196
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,580
not negative integers, and if all three of them

197
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,020
are zero, but the energy is zero, and if one, two

198
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,510
or three of those cases are one, then the energies

199
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:19,790
of SCRIMPY times one, two or three. So what comes

200
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,970
next in the list of energies?

201
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,070
Shout it out when you. I have an idea.

202
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,770
I can't quite hear what's coming next was.

203
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,110
Indeed, you can have four when any one of those

204
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,590
key squared or any one of the cases, two squares

205
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,350
before and the other two are zero sum, so there's

206
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,240
a five and a six when we have two. And one of the

207
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,090
others will go to the others. The one what comes

208
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:17,810
after six.

209
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,650
Exactly. There's no way to get seven, we have to

210
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:30,110
have two of those caves being to get four plus

211
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,900
four with zero or plus one.

212
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,180
And once, of course, we get to nine, then one of

213
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,610
those kids can be free, the others can be zero or

214
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:49,630
one or one plus one. We can have a four plus four

215
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:58,210
plus four kids, 12 and a nine plus four kids, 13,

216
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,850
nine four one four 14. And.

217
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:13,570
Nine. It's the. After that, from nine for one, we

218
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,010
have to jump up to nine for four or 17.

219
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:28,650
Right. And so on. So there are gaps coming from

220
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,220
this. Disorganization where?

221
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:41,180
These three individuals cannot add up to. Certain

222
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,040
integers. That's exactly what it was. It's just

223
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:55,640
the devil in those etcs. So. These numbers don't

224
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,860
include seven.

225
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,450
And then.

226
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,670
15, 16.

227
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,880
So this is giving back, giving us back a bit

228
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:21,130
closer to those systems that we had in the

229
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,950
previous application where the energies were

230
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,560
falling into discrete energy levels.

231
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:33,410
Though we have just seen that the energy gaps

232
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,470
between the levels and the system are not constant,

233
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,590
and especially as those integer cases go to larger

234
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:48,390
numbers. The big gaps between accessible energy

235
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,900
levels will start to to grow.

236
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,330
We'll skip some of these into spaces in this.

237
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:04,920
Basic unit. Each R-squared. Types would never

238
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,620
cheat and elsewhere.

239
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,470
Another difference with that system is that these

240
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,940
entities can grow without bound, even for a finite

241
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,180
number of particles, and so there's still an

242
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,820
infinite number of possible moments and possible

243
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,720
energy levels. And even for a single particle in

244
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,090
this box, that would be an infinite number of

245
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,210
energy levels. But these are now countable,

246
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,200
related to subsets of the positive, not negative

247
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,930
integers. Which means that our some accounts,

248
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:46,860
these microstates is a meaningful medical function,

249
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,250
giving us a well-defined canonical protection

250
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,620
function, and even though it was a bit counter to

251
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,040
the spirit of the statistical physics of large

252
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,050
collections of particles, we can start by

253
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,990
considering what the protection function would be

254
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:09,660
for just a single particle in this gas, in this

255
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,780
stupid box. Where the microstates are, then we sum

256
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:19,670
over these possible non-negative values of the

257
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,290
integers, k is causality running from zero up to

258
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:28,600
infinity, plugging in. The energy written down

259
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:34,340
above and dividing it by the temperature to get a

260
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,860
dimensionless quantity that could go in the

261
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,480
exponential, so distributing the exponential of a

262
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,680
sum into a product of exponential. We can

263
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,590
rearrange these infinite songs. We always want to

264
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:53,030
be careful when doing so, because sometimes bad

265
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,320
things can happen in this case, the independence

266
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,650
of the moment in each of these three spatial

267
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:05,790
dimensions. Allows us to distribute the sums over

268
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,810
Kidwai kids at. Without. Running into any problems

269
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,080
and we can recognize that each of these three sons

270
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,110
that are being multiplied together are completely

271
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:24,150
identical. So we have a single sum over some. OK,

272
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,620
from zero to infinity, and that overall sum ends

273
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,140
up being cubed for this single particle.

274
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,940
Next, that's what we do with this song, is

275
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,480
actually simplify it by the sense now that our

276
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,170
system has been regulated or regularized, we can

277
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,290
go back to working with continuously varying real

278
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:00,220
degrees of freedom that are. You need to work with

279
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,120
now that elements of invented calculus and we

280
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,660
could motivate this by. Considering this factor,

281
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,830
each party squared PI squared over to him

282
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,550
elsewhere, times the temperature that appears in

283
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:21,110
these energies. So if we.

284
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,510
Bringing in some knowledge about the domains where

285
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,020
relativistic physics and quantum physics come into

286
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:43,710
play. We can. Recognize or take his input that

287
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:49,500
place, Constance, this bar is far smaller than all

288
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,730
the other numbers that appear in this expression

289
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,050
in particular, I mentioned earlier that if that if

290
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:58,360
the mass of the particles gets too small. Then

291
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,520
relativistic effects become important. So this is

292
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,220
our assumption of non relativistic particles means

293
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,460
that.

294
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,560
This is a fairly large number, if the temperature

295
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,260
is too low, we will eventually have to worry about

296
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,050
quantum effects or assumption that. There's

297
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,840
passage classical ensures that the temperature is

298
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,710
relatively large compared to calcium. And finally,

299
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,380
if the volume of this box. Is too small. And we.

300
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:37,600
Also run into quantum effects or just not have

301
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,330
enough particles to justify its statistical

302
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:46,310
analysis in the first place and. Recognizing that

303
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,320
this function are sending over.

304
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:54,670
Is then going to be extremely small numbers for.

305
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,360
Any of these non-negative integers, hey, at least

306
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,050
when those are small enough to leave this

307
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,440
exponential factor non-negotiable. We can't

308
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,430
replace these discrete integers with a smoothly

309
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:16,770
varying. Continuous real number and go from the

310
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:20,300
discrete, some coming from some of the microstates

311
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:25,940
to end integration over that smoothly varying.

312
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,810
Real parameter will look cat to distinguish it

313
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:36,280
from the integer K, so each of the three songs

314
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,710
appearing in that single particle partition

315
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:44,110
function become an integral minging to this K

316
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,170
ranging from zero to infinity of that same

317
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,950
exponential factor. And in this case, that squared

318
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,120
which. You can change the. No amount of

319
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,100
integration to make things look a little more

320
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,290
gorshin just by bringing in the factor of two.

321
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,010
Thanks to all the functional attendance in here,

322
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,100
just being on the powers of have squared. Coming

323
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,060
from that exponential.

324
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,500
And given that we're working with real variables

325
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,230
again, now that we've regularized the system and

326
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:22,270
have things we'll be able to find, we can convert

327
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:27,780
back from this. Dimensionless real parameter came

328
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,740
add to the momentum that are related to it by the

329
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:39,540
same factor four times over. So in the end. Each

330
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:44,790
of these sums into your case, it's converted into.

331
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:51,190
And integral to the full range of momentum. And we

332
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:56,050
end up putting this or taking the cube of this

333
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,670
integral to account for the momentum in all three

334
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:05,590
directions. There are three factors of. Now over

335
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,930
to a high bar looking up front that the integral

336
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:15,560
over the full three dimensional space of momentum,

337
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,600
so the three integral over the volume of this

338
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,280
exponential function, converting back to the. In

339
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,630
her product of these three vector momentum. And a

340
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,070
similar process of multiplying together many

341
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,740
different integrals takes us from the single

342
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:41,110
particle competition function to the. Protection

343
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:46,890
function for people and particle's. As just like

344
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,980
those different components of the momentum, all of

345
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,160
these particles are independent and not

346
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,460
interacting with each other thanks to considering

347
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,690
ideal gases. And if we assume that we can

348
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,020
distinguish the particles from each other, every

349
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,850
single one of them is going to bring in. The

350
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,110
factor of. Eligible by age two times is three

351
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,880
integral. So we have in total and a little bit

352
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,570
more to the power of three nd and then an integral

353
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:27,100
over three end components of momentum. The

354
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,910
exponential growth from a sum over all of those

355
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,650
particles labeled by the lower case and here.

356
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,500
And I think I copied and pasted going in there

357
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:48,860
that.

358
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:57,000
Is that some shidduch? Being there, if we have.

359
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,350
Where it should go up to the overall end

360
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,570
accounting for all of the particles in that gas, I

361
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:11,950
will fix that notation in the version of lecture

362
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,310
notes online later on today.

363
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:24,010
That was just meant to count all of the end

364
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,220
moments coming from the particles that we can pass

365
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,530
to the upper limits on that situation should not

366
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:34,480
have gone to infinity. What we can do is. Actually

367
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,970
carry out. Any single one of these integrations

368
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,190
before multiplying them all together, that's just

369
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,590
an ordinary kid grow over. In particular, inner

370
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,140
product of the momentum for the corresponding

371
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,530
particle and the corresponding component. And this

372
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,250
is, as I mentioned, when we reintroduced it, just

373
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:05,660
to get an integral that brings in a factor of Rupi

374
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,650
times, the coefficient multiplying P squared,

375
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:15,820
which is one over. The inverse of twenty over a

376
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,100
factor of two, three times that three factor L

377
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,560
over to my age and bringing things all together.

378
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,260
We can simplify the notation by. Replacing.

379
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,720
This complicated square root of a ratio of the

380
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,910
mass of the particle times, the temperature

381
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:45,830
divided by two PI squared, calling that one over

382
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:50,270
some lambda t h. That depends on the temperature.

383
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,250
So this is.

384
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,080
A step taken for notational convenience where?

385
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:06,610
We've introduced what is called this to. Is. The

386
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,160
thermal deploy wavelength.

387
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,860
As best I can pronounce that French name rudeboy

388
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:23,200
where. This wavelength that. I guess we don't have

389
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,660
to worry too much about the interpretation of this

390
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,290
factor, as

391
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,470
it turns out, if you.

392
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:36,610
Go through the exercise of inserting units for

393
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,290
recounting for what all the units are on each bar,

394
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,930
the mass of the temperature. This comes as the

395
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:49,320
square root comes out to have units of length. And

396
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,980
is reflecting essentially the.

397
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,770
Wavelike behavior of these particles in the box

398
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,170
coming from quantum mechanics, essentially

399
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,980
measuring how much space each particle is is

400
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,940
taking up, given the temperature and given to the

401
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,340
mass of that particle. All we can have to worry

402
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,740
about the quantum mechanics here, we can just

403
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,670
treat this as an additional inconvenience, ending

404
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:27,020
up with this overall. Protection function for an

405
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,570
essential particles that.

406
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,720
Comes in as just the ratio of the total length of

407
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:40,660
the box containing those particles divided by. The.

408
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,450
Thermal wavelengths, another quantity with units

409
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,820
of length to make this event dimensionless no

410
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,570
reason, the power of three and four of three

411
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:54,960
special directions X, Y, Z and all and particles

412
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,630
in the system if we redistribute that. In Cuba, we

413
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,320
can recall that the volume of our covid box is

414
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,000
allocute and can rewrite this as the ratio of that

415
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,890
volume to the different wavelength lambda cubed.

416
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,980
All of that raised to the power and for the

417
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,200
particles in the system.

418
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,740
So that is. The partition function, the ending of

419
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,680
the derivation of the starting point for any

420
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,430
statistical physics analysis of ideal gases and

421
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:38,660
the canonical ensemble. So apart from the typo I

422
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,290
had in, there were the individual steps of the

423
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,920
argumentation in what we were doing to derive this

424
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,470
unobjectionable.

425
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,790
And not hearing any objections, I will give you. A

426
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:08,610
few more observations before we go on to actually

427
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:13,500
drive things about this ideal gas is one thing to

428
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,180
note is that in addition to the temperature that

429
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,810
gets wrapped up into the DeBois wavelength, Lambda

430
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:26,550
T h and the number of particles in which we should

431
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:31,350
expect to characterize any statistical system

432
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,080
analyzing the chemical ensemble, there's also

433
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:41,400
dependence on the volume of the gas, which is

434
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,800
going to persist in some of the quantities that we

435
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,600
derive. A lot more to say about that later on this

436
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:48,980
week.

437
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:55,580
And one of the comment to put in here is, again,

438
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:59,490
without some reference to the work we were doing

439
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:04,020
yesterday, seeing how. Physical predictions

440
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:08,340
differed, if we could if we assumed that we could

441
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,290
distinguish between different particles in the

442
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,660
system or if all those particles were

443
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,760
indistinguishable. We should see what would happen

444
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,180
to the protection function if we were to have

445
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,620
indistinguishable particles convention, just as an

446
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,340
aside, that.

447
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,160
Quantum mechanics will also require

448
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,220
indistinguishable particles to the assumption that

449
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:38,140
we can say, look at the particles of the gas and

450
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:43,740
put labels on them. It may be. Too small to see

451
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,280
here. Why don't you zoom in on the assumption that

452
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,230
we can. Label the particles in the system, say, a.

453
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:56,000
And be it distinguish between different labelling

454
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:00,460
of sets of particles with identical memento. That

455
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,690
is something that is only possible in classical

456
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:07,900
systems. And there's another consequence that

457
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,630
arises from. Our assumption or simplification of

458
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:17,460
dealing just with classical, non quantum. Ideal

459
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,130
gas is for the time being.

460
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:29,390
And. Given that. Setting where classical physics

461
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,350
allows us to.

462
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,910
Impose labels or apply labels to different

463
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:39,150
particles doesn't require that it is possible to

464
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,380
apply these sorts of labels. There's no practical

465
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,230
way to do that for TV.

466
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:53,040
The nitrogen and the water molecules that are

467
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,450
opposing the atmosphere in this room, there's no

468
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:01,530
way to label a particular molecule, molecule A,

469
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,550
molecule molecule B and tell them apart. And the

470
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,880
absence of those labels, then the two states that

471
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,990
we have here with a given volume temperature for

472
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:17,640
the system are in fact the same microstates rather

473
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,070
than two distinct ones in the case with those

474
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,290
particles are indistinguishable.

475
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,710
So zooming back out, we can think about what

476
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,700
consequences this has for those storms over

477
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,800
microstates that give us our competition function.

478
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,810
Where we've seen that if we have two particles

479
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:49,050
here, there is a factor of two difference in the

480
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,980
number of ways of assigning momenta to the

481
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,030
particles that are being labeled when they can be

482
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,510
labeled.

483
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:05,790
And if we generalize this to. Three particles and.

484
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,370
Look at the various ways those three particles

485
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:15,800
with pretty momenta could be labeled and the

486
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,630
distinguishable case. Where we assume labeling is

487
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:25,680
possible, you pretty easily see that. There are a

488
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,630
few more possibilities if we label. Particle A

489
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,880
corresponding to come into one that more to get

490
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:34,880
the back of the screen.

491
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,660
And we can label the particle with momentum to

492
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,660
call that B and the final label C because the

493
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,290
particle with momentum P three and similarly. Swap

494
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:52,550
those labels and see just the same way we swap

495
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:58,740
labels and be. In this illustration. Or go through

496
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,250
the possibility of first labeling. That's particle

497
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:09,320
with momentum, P one s, B, the other two as A and

498
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:09,800
C.

499
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,990
Or similarly with the third and final possibility,

500
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,680
so the overall number of possibilities of six, we

501
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,900
can see pretty easily just three factorial.

502
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,070
There's. In general, within particle's, there are

503
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,890
and ways of choosing the label for the first one

504
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,440
in minus one, ways of choosing a label for the

505
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,680
second one and so on, until that last article is

506
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,020
its label is uniquely determined.

507
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:47,440
And what this means is says is that if we assume

508
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,610
particles are distinguishable, then we will count

509
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:57,130
a factor of 10 factorial times more microstates

510
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,670
compared to the situation if those particles were

511
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,820
indistinguishable and all of these labeling was.

512
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,570
Just collapse down to a single microstates rather

513
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,520
than in factorial.

514
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:23,830
So. If we. Repeat the derivation of the partition

515
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,370
function.

516
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:30,630
We can recognize without reviewing any more

517
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,150
detailed calculations that

518
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,620
the overall factor of squared for every micro

519
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:42,480
statistic and a single case is just one to come

520
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,680
along for the ride of going to discrete integer

521
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,920
momentum and then coming back to approximate those

522
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,330
by continuous integrations. So we will end up with

523
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:58,740
that same expression, the volume over the cube of

524
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,710
the word wavelength, always the power in with that

525
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,900
fixed factor of whatever and factorial to correct

526
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:11,850
for the overcounting that we did in.

527
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,710
The earlier.

528
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,050
Work based on the assumption that particles were

529
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:19,980
distinguishable.

530
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:22,840
So.

531
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:33,440
What we can write down as a conclusion to this

532
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,280
calculation.

533
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:41,700
Before diving into getting some predictions out of

534
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,370
these parties and functions, is just the

535
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,950
recognition that the. Patricia, function for

536
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:52,500
indistinguishable particles is. The single

537
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,190
particle partition function refused to empower.

538
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:02,830
Which is this factory and factory, two times the

539
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,760
production function for indistinguishable articles

540
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:11,290
is that I compared to the whole related to single

541
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,920
particle production function and one to the power.

542
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,470
And now, based on the. Machinery that we've built

543
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:28,760
up over the past week or so, we can take these

544
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:35,430
precision functions and use them to. To make

545
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,220
predictions, compute properties of the large scale

546
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,220
behavior of these gases and targeting just as we

547
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,060
did, and for those spin systems yesterday, looking

548
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:49,050
first at the internal energy and the entropy of

549
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:55,200
that gas and the functions of the temperature and

550
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:58,710
of particle number, as well as the volume within

551
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:01,830
which the gases contained.

552
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:10,230
So. We went through the work previously of

553
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:13,440
relating these observables to the partition

554
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:18,120
function through that HUMBOLDT'S free energy, the

555
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,940
negative temperature times, the logarithm of the

556
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,940
production function. And if we look at this

557
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,490
equation, gifty one on the top of the page here,

558
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:31,460
you can see that this logarithm is going to. Break

559
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:36,320
up into two pieces of logarithm of the product

560
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,760
being distributed as the sum of her logarithms,

561
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,910
this power of three and over two comes down out

562
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,070
front to join the temperature. We have the log of

563
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:49,430
everything in the parentheses, EMC squared,

564
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:55,670
squared, and then whatever factor that Vectorial

565
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,850
brings a relative negative sign in to cancel out

566
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,370
the overall negative sign. And we just have the

567
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:05,630
temperature times, the logarithm of an vectorial

568
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,200
factor,

569
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,840
putting this in the expression for the average

570
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,370
interval energy as the temperature derivative of

571
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,470
the free energy divided by the temperature, which

572
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,640
is just that logarithm, the only place where the

573
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,970
temperature is appearing. In. The logarithm of

574
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:35,300
this partition function. It's going to be. Right

575
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:39,470
in that three halves in Lord T squared, we can

576
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:42,470
break up the remainder of this logarithm to

577
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,310
isolate all of the T independent pieces at

578
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,610
logarithm within Petronius, also to independents.

579
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,390
And the derivative of the logarithm is one over

580
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:58,710
temperature. So we end up with that whatever

581
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:02,210
temperature canceling off the second tower of

582
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,440
temperature coming up front. So in the end, three

583
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:11,250
has a. is the internal energy which we can

584
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:14,640
interpret as every single one of those and

585
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:19,950
particles in the gas introducing on average. A an

586
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:24,660
energy and internal energy of three 1/2 times the

587
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,400
temperature, which is. Fairly remarkable compared

588
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,850
to the complicated function based on the

589
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:35,480
microscopic momentum of each of those particles

590
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,320
that we started off with just a few minutes ago,

591
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,670
the start of today.

592
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:50,840
To get the entropy and turn have the relation

593
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:55,130
between. The Entropia and the difference between

594
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:59,020
internal energy and free energy normalized by the

595
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,870
temperature, so plugging in this three hands and

596
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:05,290
feet and dividing that by the temperature, we

597
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:09,270
start off with an overall factor of three and then

598
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,880
divide up the temperature out of this expression

599
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:16,550
up here. Leaves us with these two terms that

600
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,630
involve logarithms.

601
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:25,890
Putting the thermal the wavelength back into this

602
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:30,480
complicated ratio gets us back to that same ratio

603
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,710
of the. Volume over. The Broadway by Cube that we

604
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,890
had up in the equation 50 wanted to start off with.

605
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:45,840
Where the blame is coming in, thanks to taking

606
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,410
note that we have pre factor up into the.

607
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:56,460
Into the argument of the war. And with the log of

608
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,420
L squared to the prehaps, power is cubed is the

609
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,290
volume and similarly for the wavelength, and we've

610
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:08,040
now seen that scene, what to do, and we have

611
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:12,900
logarithms of the factorial of large numbers just

612
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:16,930
plugging in. Sterling's formula at the.

613
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:24,930
Leading a couple of terms employed in business and

614
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:28,470
neglecting any terms that are logarithmic and the

615
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:34,440
more smaller that pops up here and we can combine

616
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,800
these two logarithms that come with that three

617
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,410
factor and into a single one in terms of all of

618
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,920
that volume over end times. But thermal wave

619
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:53,160
length and then the factors of three thousand plus

620
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,970
and add up to five has an overall.

621
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:00,630
And.

622
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:06,580
The next step will be to repeat this process where

623
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:10,670
the case of the particles, it may well be useful

624
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:16,280
to return to that on Friday, looking at the time

625
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,800
at the moment. Can.

626
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:25,080
For the next few days, checking that all of these

627
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,440
steps are clear and can be reproduced in the scan,

628
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:33,140
the comments will wrap up with to finish off today,

629
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:38,370
is that. In this ratio of volume over 10 times

630
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:40,550
that from the different wavelength can actually

631
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:44,780
interpret the denominator there as the volume

632
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:48,500
being occupied by all of the particles in the gas.

633
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,970
And we will see later on when we relax our

634
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,670
requirement that the gas be classical and allow

635
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:58,400
for all the mechanical effects to play a role,

636
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:03,590
that those effects will start to become important

637
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:07,040
when this volume occupied by the gas starts to

638
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,610
become comparable to the overall volume of the

639
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:14,210
container. So I'll stop. There you go for the rest

640
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:18,440
of your day. Hopefully will dry out now. Any final

641
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,370
questions before I shut things down this morning?

642
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,530
Take care. See you again on Friday.
