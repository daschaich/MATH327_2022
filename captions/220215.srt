1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,680
All right, good morning.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:11,350
Let's get things set up and underway for Tuesday,

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,300
starting with this

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,010
number for the monitoring system, today

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,880
seven, six, three,

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,330
two three seven.

7
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,940
And we can pick up more or less where we left off

8
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,390
yesterday, just check in quickly to see if there

9
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,820
are any questions about either the computer

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,050
project---this is the last time we will

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,960
before it's due in a couple of days---or about the

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,610
micro canonical example that we wrapped up just to

13
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,890
be. And of yesterday

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:11,200
reiterate briefly that in the microeconomic

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,300
approach. The fundamental qualities that define

16
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,450
that ensemble is a probability face are the

17
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,850
conservation of energy and conserve particle, no.

18
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,900
And from that thing like. Entropy and also the

19
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,710
temperature are. Derived qualities that we saw at

20
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,550
the end of yesterday, Kim. In some situations,

21
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,090
behave as we expect in the everyday sorts of

22
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,330
experiences that we have or experiments that we

23
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,840
would do in a physics lab and in other ways, you

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,600
can look very different, for instance, in the

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,100
appearance of negative temperatures or divergences

26
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,310
in the case of spin systems. Or in general, in

27
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,250
general systems where the number of microstates

28
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:12,260
decreases as. The amount of energy available

29
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,510
increases and.

30
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,180
This is part of the motivation for turning now to

31
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,240
the next.

32
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,200
It's the physical exam over the next probably

33
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,470
states that will be considering before diving into

34
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,590
some more detailed applications of all these ideas.

35
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,670
So today is going to be more of a foundation

36
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,630
laying introduction to the canonical ensemble of

37
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,990
mathematical justification for what is physically

38
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:52,590
a more natural way of looking at physics, which is

39
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,990
to swap out the conservation of energy for a fixed

40
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,590
temperature that will define this ensemble. There

41
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,770
are many motivations for this, and this is the

42
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,690
reason why it's called the canonical ensemble

43
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,530
canonical meaning through ordinary or standard,

44
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,560
for one thing. Just this. Assumption,

45
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,890
microbiological case that. Energy can be exactly

46
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,160
conserved in the system of interest means, as we

47
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,040
said, that the system has to be perfectly isolated

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,620
from the rest of the universe, enclosed box full

49
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,100
of particles floating in a perfect void, which is

50
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,640
not what we have. In our lives or in any physics

51
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,000
experiment, fully isolating a statistical system

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,750
is simply impossible. People want to look at it or

53
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,770
do any work and do the experiments on it. And.

54
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,660
There's also the complication of driving a

55
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,810
temperature from a fixed energy. You also saw

56
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,440
practical difficulties in the canonical case with

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,610
unwieldy factorial, expressions that are popping

58
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,290
up, which will we will eventually avoid by.

59
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,710
Working with. A nice. Intensive temperature that

60
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,280
we can set and fixed the definition of this

61
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,530
ensemble rather than the internal energy, which is

62
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:28,660
an extensive bodily. So just to formally state the

63
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,190
definition, the canonical ensemble is taking our

64
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,190
usual musical ensemble as a probability space

65
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,150
subject now to the constraints of a fixed

66
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,480
temperature and the same conservative particle

67
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,060
number as in the case. And the question now

68
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,360
becomes, mathematically, how do we justify fixing

69
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,720
this temperature, which up till now we've seen as

70
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,610
a derived quantity following from the first law,

71
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,500
from a dynamic observation of energy. And the way

72
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,720
this is done is by placing. Our canonical ensemble

73
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,060
or system of interest in thermal contact with a

74
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,640
reservoir or a heat bath. Which is a much larger

75
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,490
external system called Omega's Reservoir, in

76
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,550
contrast to the Omega. Of the system we're going

77
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,730
to be interested in throughout this. Where the

78
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:40,340
overall system? The direct product of our system

79
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,340
with interest and this much larger reservoir

80
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,710
doesn't obey conservation of energy and is

81
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,290
therefore covered by the micropower example that

82
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,610
we are now familiar with.

83
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,400
Now, what this thermal contact does, if we look at

84
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,930
our system of interest just itself, its energy is

85
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,500
able to fluctuate by exchanging energy with this

86
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,640
large reservoir. And at the same time, because the

87
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,510
temperature is an intensive quantity, the same for

88
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,020
all of these systems that are in contact with each

89
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,540
other. The temperature of our economical ensemble

90
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,690
and media is going to be fixed by that much larger

91
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,630
reservoir. We will set things up so that the

92
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,570
system itself has a negligible effect from the of

93
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,290
contact, the overall setup.

94
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,160
So this is going to be. The analysis is going to

95
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,460
look a bit like that heated exchange that we

96
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,240
analyzed yesterday. I mean, that thermal contact

97
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,170
caused flow of energy between two different

98
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,630
systems, bringing their temperatures closer

99
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,960
together. The difference now is that the

100
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,780
temperature is something we can declare fixed from

101
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,960
the outset rather than something we have to derive,

102
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,880
at least for the ensemble of interest. Now. The

103
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,500
approach here is through the lengthy arguments as

104
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,110
to why we are able to do this and it's

105
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,170
mathematically justified and the approach is going

106
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:25,080
to be introducing a well motivated onsides for the

107
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,650
form of this federal reservoir and then showing

108
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:34,380
that. Once we go through the full analysis or

109
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,350
consideration based on that answer, that's all

110
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,310
reference to the reservoir drops out of. The

111
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,970
expressions we find governing the economical

112
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,530
system that we are targeting so that the answers

113
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:56,510
we adopted becomes irrelevant in the end. So

114
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,150
that's the specific form of the reservoir is

115
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,490
ultimately irrelevant, as long as it is present,

116
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,780
you will be able to conclude that the thermal

117
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,080
reservoir plays its role in fixing the temperature

118
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,510
of the economical system and allowing its energy

119
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:16,490
to fluctuate. So what that is, is what's known as

120
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,820
the replica trick that was introduced by Gibbs,

121
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,850
which is to say that the total system, the

122
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,910
combination of the reservoir and our system of

123
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:30,080
interest is just a large number of identical

124
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,970
replicas of that system of interest, which has a

125
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,970
few motivations. First of all, if we take it for

126
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,290
granted that we are interested in a well defined

127
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,350
or reasonable physical system of mega, then just

128
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,960
taking a bunch of copies of it guarantees that the

129
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,210
reservoir itself is also going to be equally.

130
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,300
Well, motivated and sensible, we can also sort of

131
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,380
take the more handwaving, physicist's perspective

132
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,400
of, for example, doing some experiment out here on

133
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,850
this room, bottle up some subset of that area,

134
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,830
then we can take this the air in this bottle as a

135
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,870
system of interest. It's nice to see also the

136
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,990
particle numbers conserved. It's in contact with

137
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,270
all the rest of the air in this room, which forms

138
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,110
that thermal ensemble and can be analyzed just as.

139
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,130
All just many times, larger amount of it.

140
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:37,530
So to continue developing this idea with a little

141
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,000
more formal but still very small example of it.

142
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,980
But consider again, it's been system as usual,

143
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,850
just to get started with a very small number of

144
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,720
spins so that we don't spend too much time drawing

145
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,680
arrows and can get the idea without

146
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,510
too much effort. So just two spins and we will say

147
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,000
the views are distinguishable so that we can tell

148
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,850
which spin is which and distinguish between the

149
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,630
cases where the spin on the left is pointing down

150
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,510
or the spin on the right is pointing down, both of

151
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,370
those being distinct microstates. So the total

152
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,040
number of microstates that we can have for these

153
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,580
two spins is just to the two or the four states

154
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,110
that are drawn here, both up, both down. And the

155
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,870
two possibilities for having one up and one down

156
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,070
and then.

157
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,120
The drawing here shows another extremely small

158
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,500
example of. How we can bring together a bunch of

159
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,440
replicas of this system. Choose one of these

160
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,840
replicas to be the Omega that we will. Declare to

161
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,140
be the one we are analyzing and say that all of

162
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,380
these replicas are in thermal contact with each

163
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,550
other, they have boxes drawn around them so that

164
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,330
they can to remind ourselves that the particle no

165
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:20,230
in each replica is conserved. And so long as each

166
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,020
of these systems is in contact, possibly through a

167
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,140
series of intermediates with the others, we can

168
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,690
wait long enough for the overall total system of

169
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:38,200
nine replicas of this to be set up to reach a

170
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,250
thermal equilibrium. I can mention that even

171
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,690
though I've laid out these replicas of this square

172
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:50,770
grid, that is not something that we need to assume

173
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:55,370
so long as there is some contact between. Each of

174
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,160
these replicas and the rest of the system, all of

175
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,000
them will evolve to thermodynamic equilibrium,

176
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,250
something that's sometimes called the zeroth law

177
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,920
of thermodynamics. It's more fundamental even than

178
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,600
the first or the second

179
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,270
and.

180
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,830
With this small example in mind, you can.

181
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,960
Start writing them mathematical expressions for

182
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:28,260
this overall system by defining the occupation. No.

183
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:36,480
Using that as a convenient. Quantity to manipulate

184
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,260
where this occupation number and supply

185
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:45,270
corresponds to each of those microstates in our

186
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,110
small system of. So in the example of health care

187
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,340
for Omega's, depending on the orientations of the

188
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,550
spin's and the four occupation numbers, one for

189
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,590
each of those microstates is the number of

190
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:03,780
replicas that adopt this particular small system,

191
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:09,810
microstates in any overall product state for the

192
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:16,350
total system of all our replicants. So I can't

193
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:21,450
quite. Fit everything onto the same page here, but

194
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,080
we can count the occupation numbers just from this.

195
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,570
Small example, so remind you that microstates one

196
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,510
has both arrows pointing down. So what is the.

197
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:44,670
Occupation number. For at microstates. In this

198
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,810
overall system.

199
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,900
I hear three, which are those three they're.

200
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,730
How about a to his first down, then up? And they

201
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:11,090
did three things up and down in the member for. It

202
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,200
was both up. What are the. Corresponding

203
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,800
occupation numbers and this small example for

204
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,280
those.

205
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:31,200
Yeah. Two for my great state to.

206
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,040
There's one, there's the other microstates, three.

207
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,570
And also here to again. And see one there and

208
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,930
there and then stay for there, is this the final

209
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:56,840
two? And we have there, which makes it.

210
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,770
Rewrite that result in this box, the occupation

211
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,140
numbers, for this example, three, two to two,

212
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:17,130
which do some to total number of nine replicas. In

213
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,300
fairly trivial way.

214
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,870
Now, from these occupation numbers, we can

215
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,670
equivalently work with the fraction of the total

216
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,270
number of replicas are in any particular

217
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,470
microsleep, we can look at the fraction of

218
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,870
replicas that are in the corresponding microphages

219
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:45,730
divide or normalized by the total number are. And

220
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,950
then that gives us occupation probabilities. Peace

221
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,860
of mind is the occupation number divided by half,

222
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,960
which is a well defined probability as it all sums

223
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,640
up to one. All replicas are accounted for. And

224
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,680
even though. I'm calling this the same with the

225
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,390
same label as the microsleep probabilities that we

226
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,960
were working with in the canonical ensemble. It is

227
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,220
not. Or at least not yet the same thing. Rather

228
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,920
than being able to interpret this, at least for

229
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,020
now, as the probability that our system is in

230
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:36,010
microstates, oh my God, this is the probability

231
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,130
that if we were to choose one of these replicas at

232
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,280
random, it would be in that microstates of the

233
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:48,380
small system. The notation suggests that. We will

234
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,590
eventually find this to be the same, that will

235
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,970
come in due course now.

236
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:03,890
For this. Overall system. The first law

237
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,360
laframboise dynamics between to hold energy

238
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,600
continues to be conserved, so we have a fixed

239
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,380
amount of energy in that overall system of all of

240
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,220
these replicas.

241
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,180
And we're going to assume that the contribution of

242
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,890
each of those are replicas to the total energy is

243
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,690
independent of all the others, so it could be

244
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,940
considered a an independent random variable. So

245
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,630
this is.

246
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,250
And assumption at this point, it holds. Pretty

247
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,190
straightforwardly, for now, the tracking systems

248
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,480
that we are focusing for the bulk of this term

249
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,590
will actually prove that in in Unit nine when we

250
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,340
define what it means to be interacting or not and

251
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,140
also holds more generally than that.

252
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,160
When interactions are allowed within each replica

253
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,090
of not between the different replica. So it's

254
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,280
going to be at this level A.

255
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,630
Conditions similar to the conservation of particle

256
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,660
no, within each of the replicas that we were able

257
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,740
to impose from the outset. We just have criminal

258
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:27,910
contact only. Which allows. Each of the energies

259
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,610
of each of these replicas to fluctuate so long as

260
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,720
their total adds up to this fixed and conserved

261
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,700
value.

262
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,860
Now. One other thing we can say about. The

263
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,730
energies of each of these replicas is that each

264
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,400
replica of each small system that we are actually

265
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,660
interested in can make it most and possible values

266
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,390
where M is the usual number of microstates in that

267
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,530
small system. Some of these values may well be the

268
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:08,600
same. That's no problem. We have survived the use

269
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,910
of K for two to six microstates equals a mega J.

270
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,160
We can just some over the same value of the energy

271
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:22,550
twice when we rearrange an expression for a total

272
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:26,030
energy of the replicas. This first quality is

273
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,910
trivial. Just saying it's we go over all of the

274
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,300
replicas. The energy is the sum. That's the

275
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,930
definition of extensibility, which the energy

276
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,660
obeys is an expensive quantity. And keeping the

277
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,610
number of replicas of the number of microstates

278
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:49,240
finite, it is just a straightforward rearrangement

279
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,050
of the sum of the energy of each replica, the sub,

280
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:57,190
instead of the number of replicas and so on in

281
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,600
each microstates Omega Sevi that comes along with

282
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,760
this possibly not unique energy use by the eye.

283
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:11,570
And this is on is now running from one up to. The

284
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:16,520
total microstates that our small system can take.

285
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,270
So what we've done here is a promising first step

286
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,270
towards our ultimate goal of removing the

287
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,390
reservoir from this analysis is find that the

288
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:33,470
overall total. Energy for this entire system with

289
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,490
its large heat that can be expressed just in terms

290
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,610
of the. Microstates of that small system.

291
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:52,270
Now, the. Next step, well, Paul is here to see if

292
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:58,210
the set up in the first steps are. Clear out 30.

293
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,410
Questions about the implications of this approach.

294
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:14,270
I'm not seeing any. We'll move on to the next step,

295
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,760
which is to essentially impose thermodynamic

296
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,330
equilibrium and say that the overall micro state

297
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:33,020
of the product of all of these are replicas can be

298
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,640
fully specified just by the fixed set of

299
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,640
occupation numbers. Nothing could be an

300
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,850
microstates of our system of interest.

301
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,580
Which is equivalent to assuming that the

302
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,030
occupation probabilities we have now defined our

303
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,200
concept of time, which is another way of defining

304
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:04,740
and equilibrium. So this guarantees that the total

305
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,480
energy of the overall system is conserved. And we

306
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:17,500
now want to. Use the tools from the previous unit

307
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:23,000
to use to extract the temperature. From that.

308
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,980
Overall micro economic system. And we've seen

309
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,840
yesterday that the first step to doing this

310
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,000
determination of the temperature in the

311
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,090
microeconomic approach is figuring out the number

312
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:44,410
of microstates at the overall total system can

313
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,470
have them taking. The logarithm of that gives us

314
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,520
the entropy. Taking the derivative of that will

315
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,980
give us the temperature.

316
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:02,140
So. The first step in this process is determining

317
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,920
the total number of microstates that we can have

318
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,580
across all our of these Reptilicus.

319
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:17,960
Now, the. The way to do this is to proceed.

320
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,820
Microsleep on microstates. Going over all of the

321
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,610
possibilities on. In the system of interest, so if

322
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,750
we first consider, say, microstates or maybe one,

323
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,310
you can think back to that step sample to

324
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,440
visualize this, you want to figure out the total

325
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,920
number of microstates among all our replicas. The

326
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,010
first step is figuring out how many times for a

327
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,260
given for a fixed occupation number that we are

328
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,880
now assuming characterizes the overall system. How

329
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,280
many distinct microstates can we build up by

330
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,610
requiring that in one copies of microstates make

331
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:10,860
one appear to be all replicas, which. I could

332
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,220
rephrase by saying, how many ways can we choose

333
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,620
and one out of those are replicas to have this

334
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,220
particular microstates and choosing. And so one

335
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:28,970
out of four is that binomial factor that should

336
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,780
now be familiar from the microeconomic also. And

337
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,940
now we just have to repeat this in times for all

338
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,720
of these microstates, keeping in mind that we've

339
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,850
already gone over all of the micro with all the

340
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,340
previous microstates up to be what we are

341
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,460
currently considering. So what would be the

342
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:55,200
corresponding factor looked like for the ends of

343
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,920
two copies of microstates or make it two in the

344
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,460
system?

345
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:23,880
Yes, you need to choose and two out of the

346
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,610
remaining power minus and one.

347
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,410
Replicas that have not yet been assigned a

348
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:37,810
distinct microstates, which. We express this. In

349
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,250
terms of the ratio we have.

350
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,140
Minus and one in the numerator or minus and one

351
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:51,570
minus into the denominator. And then similarly, we

352
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:55,910
move on. To that ominous and one, two, which we

353
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:00,270
choose and three and so on, and then need to

354
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:05,900
multiply all of these factors together in order to

355
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,460
find the total number of possibilities for all the

356
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,060
different distributions of the microstates among

357
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:19,410
the replicas and something. Very pleasant happens

358
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,680
when we do this multiplication example, if we look

359
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,200
up at the first microstates.

360
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,660
Factor and then multiply it by the second

361
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,090
microsleep factor, if you will, have those

362
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,650
pictorials in the numerator denominator, the R

363
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:44,380
minus one out. We can. C, the R minus and one

364
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,110
minus and two that will appear in the numerator of

365
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,650
the next factor, cancel out that denominator. So

366
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:55,840
the product of all of these binomial coefficients

367
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,970
for all of these different and microstates end up

368
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:08,800
telescoping into the overall R factorial from the

369
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:15,820
front, from the first step. And then a numerator

370
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,480
of this factor, we have the minus one factorial

371
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,930
and minus two factorial and minus three factorial

372
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,550
all the way up to.

373
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,820
And some factorial for the final microstates.

374
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,470
And in case you were wondering if it was

375
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,600
legitimate to think first about my personal legal

376
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,070
one and then move on to a mega to an omega three,

377
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,700
or there might be depending on which microstates

378
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,040
we chose to look at first or how we chose to label

379
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:55,000
them, we can see that this result. Is independent

380
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,700
of permutations or really thanks to computer

381
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:03,670
stupidity of multiplication, so we now have a

382
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:09,010
formal expression for the entropy of this overall

383
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:15,160
system of many replicas. Which is just the

384
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,420
logarithm of the total number of microstates, so

385
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,990
the logarithm of our factorial and then the

386
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,650
logarithm of the product converts to the logarithm

387
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:32,570
of some. And with an overall negative sine. To.

388
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,690
Account for the negative one power that puts all

389
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:43,130
of these log and Sevi factorial factors in the

390
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:46,850
denominator equation. Twenty eight. We have the

391
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,420
logarithm of our factorial number of replicas,

392
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:55,580
minus the sum of the logarithms of the factorial

393
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,520
of the occupation number for each of the

394
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,730
microstates of our system of interest, the mega

395
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,000
small system embedded in the large.

396
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,820
So as we saw yesterday for the microeconomic

397
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,330
ensemble, there are lots of factorial floating

398
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:22,720
around. Which in this case, if we we have started

399
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,050
off by assuming that's correct, because it's very

400
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:30,280
large, if we further assume that the occupation

401
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,690
numbers are very large for each micro state of the

402
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,810
small system and every single one of the

403
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:42,820
logarithms. In this expression can be approximated

404
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,090
using Sterling's formula, you might look more at

405
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:50,170
that on Friday. Maybe I can ask right now, is

406
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,780
Sterling's formula something familiar that you've

407
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,960
seen before or are you hearing about it for the

408
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,680
first time? Here I see you shaking hands. So we

409
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:07,300
may justify this result in tutorial on Friday,

410
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,110
what Sterling's formula says to the next two

411
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,260
leading orders of the first two terms is that the

412
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:19,060
logarithm of the factorial of a large number is

413
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:24,280
approximately that number. And log in is the

414
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:30,100
leading term. Minus the near term and. Up to

415
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,600
logarithmic corrections that are negligible for

416
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,320
and much larger than is to remember how negligible

417
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,300
those can be from last Friday. I mentioned that if

418
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:40,860
we had.

419
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:51,460
In order to power twenty three, Morgan is of order

420
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,560
50 now. Ten to the power. Twenty two times smaller

421
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,630
and easily negligible. In this approximation.

422
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,730
Of course, you may have. Seen already that

423
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,650
requiring. Every occupation number to be large.

424
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,620
For all in microstates of our school system.

425
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:24,400
Requires that the total number of replicas has to

426
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:31,870
be much larger than an end. And given that we're

427
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:36,100
recalling that and is frequently exponentially

428
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,690
large in the.

429
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:45,160
Number of degrees of freedom. As a rough guide to

430
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,870
its size and exponential of ten to twenty three,

431
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,110
the number of replicas that we are formally

432
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,660
assuming in this derivation by applying Solms

433
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:03,760
formula is. Probably quite large, which. Is the

434
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,930
how the dynamic limits, where we will see the

435
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,090
detailed form of the reservoir will become

436
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:13,030
irrelevant, to remind you is our ultimate goal.

437
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,670
So.

438
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,690
To see if I can fit both the approximation,

439
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,940
the first two terms of each formula and the gap on

440
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:42,040
the same page just to show off by. Filling in the

441
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,900
blanks here in the first half actuarial terms, I

442
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,850
think is approximated by. Our look, our minus ah.

443
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:57,360
And then we have some of the similar

444
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,460
approximations for every one of these. And I terms

445
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:11,620
and so I want to by. Minus and survivor and what

446
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:17,810
we can do with this. Is recall.

447
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,600
First of all, there are a few things we can do

448
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,920
that with this we saw before that the sun over all

449
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,660
of the occupation numbers.

450
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,310
Just count the total number of Republicans. So

451
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:41,960
when we have just met some over and over with two

452
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,660
negative signs, we get a positive, ah, that will

453
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:50,220
cancel out that factor. And we are left with an

454
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:50,970
expression.

455
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:57,660
In terms of the occupation numbers. Is our Lord,

456
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:04,430
our. Mine is similar, and so I like to survive.

457
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,240
And we can further try to remove dependence on the

458
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,530
form of the reservoir by plugging in the relation

459
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:19,610
between the occupation numbers and occupation

460
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:26,580
probabilities. But the number of replicas. In

461
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,660
microstates, biggest eye is just the total number

462
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,650
of replicas times the probability of finding each

463
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,870
replica. In that microstates.

464
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:48,430
Rewriting things in terms of. Or so each, and I

465
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:55,100
hear. Is going to be our times, your factor of our

466
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,220
is a concept that can come out of the sun, you

467
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,310
have a pie and then the log of the product or

468
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:09,600
times pie. Be called. A load of armor plus. The

469
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,640
blog of.

470
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,420
And since these pieces are well defined

471
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,900
probabilities, you can see in this first term, you

472
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,920
can take a constant Bulgar out of the sum. In this

473
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,130
first term, we're left with the sum of the pie

474
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,300
that equals one. And we have our Lowgar. Minus our

475
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:39,740
water that cancels out is just a. Single

476
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:46,150
expression miners are the some. Of Pinboard Pae.

477
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:52,500
For. These occupation probabilities. And.

478
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:05,160
It is. Tempting to interpret this as just the. The

479
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,710
entropy being an extensive comment is saying that

480
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:14,370
the sum over probabilities is the entropy for each

481
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:18,360
of these identical replicas that then sum up to

482
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,000
the total entropy when bringing in that factor. Ah,

483
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:27,030
that is what we are not quite at the stage to be

484
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:31,230
able to say that yet, though it is certainly in

485
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:36,390
line. With the goal we have in mind to be able to

486
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:40,980
interpret these probabilities in terms of

487
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,820
microstates of an individual system rather than

488
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,150
occupation, probability is describing the overall

489
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,800
are replicas.

490
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:01,660
The next step. Keeping things micro economical and

491
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,650
just as we saw them considering the temperature

492
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,330
yesterday. Is to.

493
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:15,040
Extract dependence on the energy from these

494
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:21,310
occupation probabilities. From which we will. Have

495
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,640
in mind, you believe that the average temperature

496
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:31,390
was the dependence of entropy on changes in energy

497
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,930
with a fixed number of degrees of freedom. In the.

498
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:42,740
Way to do this is to maximize the entropy, to

499
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,140
reflect the dynamic equilibrium that we started

500
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:51,670
off by assuming it now subject to. Two constraints

501
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:58,040
on the occupation probabilities. So when we last

502
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:03,500
maximized the entropy with the multiplier on the.

503
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:08,970
Probabilities requiring that they send up to one.

504
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:14,990
We had a similar expression for modified entropy

505
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:20,550
this essabar last time around. We call this alpha

506
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,210
parameter a lambda, the grass multiplier that.

507
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:30,010
Impose reflected this constraint at the in that

508
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:33,310
case, Microsoft families were vilified here for

509
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:38,470
the overall system of our replicas in addition to.

510
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,500
This constraint of probabilities themselves have

511
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,200
to add up to one hundred percent. We also have the

512
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,680
constraints that the total energy of the system of

513
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,400
car replicas, which depends on the occupation

514
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,630
probabilities and the energy use of the individual

515
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:02,060
microstates. This is also fixed as a mobile, that

516
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,490
first law of thermodynamics. And that comes in

517
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,340
with a second.

518
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,420
Multiplier in this modified energy. We have to

519
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,700
consider now with a different coefficient. Then I

520
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:22,970
have chosen to call my masturbator just for future

521
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,700
convenience.

522
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:35,170
So this is. As a similar calculation to. What we

523
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:39,880
did very recently is anyone remember how that goes?

524
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,740
With enough confidence to shout out what the

525
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,130
derivative looks like when I'm looking at this

526
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:52,090
modified entropy with respect to the probability

527
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:52,870
piece, OK?

528
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,820
Now, this may be a. Somewhat like the expression

529
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:15,410
to expect you to to shout out, we'll just go term

530
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:19,700
by term and looking at its first term with a

531
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,850
constant factor of minus R that comes along for

532
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:26,900
the ride. We know that the derivative of peace of

533
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:30,560
mind with respect to peace brings in the product

534
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,280
of Delta Delta like some of our eyes and pulls out.

535
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:42,120
The people term then pushing through the product

536
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,330
rule to find derivatives to the logarithm brings

537
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:49,050
whatever pie that cancels out that pie and leaves

538
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:54,630
just one. There's a similar. Product or Delta IC,

539
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:58,650
and some of the pullout becomes a factor of Alpha

540
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:03,540
and the last term, a Delta IC, which with the

541
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:09,060
Silver III gives us beta our times. E.K..

542
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:16,090
Just rearrange to isolate the remaining dependence

543
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:22,390
on the probability peak divide through by R. We

544
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:29,580
have a minus one. We have plus. Alpha over R and B

545
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:36,600
R cancels out of beta, use the term. So we are

546
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,550
left with. Taking the exponential growth sides

547
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:46,800
piece of cake is the exponential of these three

548
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:54,610
terms, a minus minus one minus alpha over. Minus

549
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,840
the AK, which I divided up in that way to.

550
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,480
Right, as a ratio of three exponential.

551
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,700
Exponential at lightning speed, the times decay

552
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:17,930
for. Microstates or the microscopic responded to

553
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,330
this occupation probability.

554
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:26,960
And then you find just to find that overall

555
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,590
exponential of quantity, one minus alpha over are

556
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:36,110
in the denominator to be some other parameter said.

557
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:43,450
We can break things a little more compactly in the

558
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:52,520
traditional way, the probability piece of cake it

559
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:59,080
is, there is this one over Z times, the

560
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:04,900
exponential of the speed of times. So we now have

561
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,520
in place of the parameters alphabetically started

562
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,260
off with we've changed terminology to work in

563
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:20,350
terms of parameters, Z and data. And we fix this

564
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,080
by demanding that the two constraints we started

565
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,840
off with are satisfied. First, the.

566
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:33,290
Conservation or the well defined property of the

567
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:36,790
probability that it adds up to 100 percent. Means

568
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:42,210
that the sum of all these terms. Has to equal one

569
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:47,520
one over Z was independent of the microstates I

570
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,180
from one to and so we can just rearrange that some

571
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:56,330
multiply it through by said to say that. This is

572
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:00,500
the sum overall microstates of this exponential

573
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,770
factor e to the minus two times the energy for the

574
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:10,640
microstates. Which. Is the definition of the

575
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,400
economical partition function. It is going to be

576
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,910
the foundational quantity and the canonical

577
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:22,990
ensemble will be able to drive things like the

578
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:27,270
residual energy, the entropy and so on from it. At

579
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:29,280
the moment, it is still.

580
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:35,290
An expression that depends on an as yet unknown

581
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:39,520
withdraws multiplier data, which becomes the

582
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:43,180
energy in the microcosmic approach for the overall

583
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:49,400
system, depends on that conserved total energy. We

584
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,720
know that the multipliers that we put into the

585
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,480
modified entropy have that similar that same

586
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,530
functional dependence on the fixed mycological

587
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:04,220
energy of the whole RF system. So the second

588
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:09,860
constraint. That's something over the energies of

589
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,220
all our of those replicas gives us that fixed

590
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,990
total energy leads to a kind of complicated

591
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:22,100
relationship between data and that total energy

592
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:27,830
beat up hearing in a ratio of two songs over all

593
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:31,880
of these microstates. Fortunately, we don't need

594
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:37,670
to extract in terms of energy total.

595
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:46,080
What we have what we need to do is extract the B,

596
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:51,540
the dependence of the entropy itself, which we can

597
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:56,100
do by plugging in the of the equation. Twenty nine

598
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,920
that we now have for. These probabilities in terms

599
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,480
of these the multipliers, Souleymane.

600
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:13,680
The interest of time wrap up just with. This last

601
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,150
gap here where there is a

602
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:23,130
healthy way of doing the calculation, which is. To

603
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:27,720
just insert the probability so it's not going to

604
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,400
fit on the screen at once, only insert this. When

605
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,390
it was times you didn't mind the speed of energy

606
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:38,720
for one of these two factors of probability that

607
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,470
show up in the expression for the entropy, we.

608
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,190
Recently computed, so you will steal some of my

609
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:51,790
pie. And then consider the launch of this one over

610
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:56,830
Z, if the minus beta time's energy, that depends

611
00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:03,270
on I am using the usual manipulations of log's. We

612
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,780
have. The longer the product is the sum of the

613
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,150
logs or whatever it is, the negative said the

614
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,430
negative cancels with that. Ah, so we have on our

615
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,370
blog Z. With the Selm over just peahi. That's

616
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,580
something we know goes to one second term is going

617
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:29,120
to have the log of the exponential of minus V the

618
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,900
times, the longer the exponential is just its

619
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,560
argument. They would be the times negative for.

620
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:42,710
Is our data with the overall positive sign that we

621
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:47,370
have the some over the remaining. With the

622
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:54,960
energies of. Each micro state by. And what we saw

623
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:59,050
in equated thirty one just above here that this

624
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:04,270
some of our times, PI times is just that total

625
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:06,430
energy left with.

626
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:14,530
Said. Plus, the remaining factor, Zubayda. Times.

627
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:19,310
The total energy of the system of our replica, so

628
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:25,360
not quite enough time today to. Reach the goal of

629
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,800
removing all information about that, he Beth.

630
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:33,830
We'll recap this and wrap it up on Friday, which

631
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:39,100
maybe nice to take a few days off and then come

632
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:42,370
back to this and see if it still makes sense on

633
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:46,330
Friday morning, if there are any questions to

634
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:49,120
shout about otherwise. I will see you later this

635
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:49,410
week.
