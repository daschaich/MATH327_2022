1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,220
OK, the recording is underway. Welcome back to Tuesday

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,610
morning, picking up where we left off after the

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,440
overnight break and starting off with the

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,740
attendance recording.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,320
First I'll quickly turn on the lights just so that

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,270
this side of the board is not in shadow.  So the six digit number is

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,710
for today, eight nine, six zero,

8
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,680
eight five.

9
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:47,420
And that can stay up there and check to see both

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,210
local and remote participants, if you have any

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,200
questions coming from what we did yesterday

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,130
afternoon or what is coming up on the homework due

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,570
later this week.

14
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:11,520
Just to get us back into gear, we continue to

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,900
think about ideal gases through the canonical

16
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,290
ensemble, fixing the temperature of the particles

17
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,570
and our being, the focus of our work yesterday was

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,070
defining the pressure of these gases that are in

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,350
some container of buoyancy. And we introduce the

20
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,730
definition that the pressure was related to the

21
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:43,050
change in the internal energy of the gas as the

22
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,990
volume of that container changed is a control

23
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,930
parameter in addition to the temperature and

24
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,810
particle number. And importantly, this change in

25
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,270
volume had to proceed without changing the entropy

26
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,650
in this definition. So isotropic change in the

27
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:05,970
volume that we showed reduces to the usual force

28
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,850
per unit area that pressure.

29
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:17,210
Is described as in the more introductory classical

30
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:22,580
mechanics modules on the basis of that.

31
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,460
We introduced the concept of work, which is the

32
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,610
change in this internal energy. That is due to the

33
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,960
application of this external force. In particular

34
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,820
related to the pressure. For that reason, through

35
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,280
this general relationship, the work is the

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,760
negative of the pressure times, the change in

37
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,720
volume, which we can write. In a more

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,670
infinitesimal looking way as minus P times D.V.,

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,630
or if we have some larger scale change, the volume

40
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,900
over which the pressure itself is changing as a

41
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,290
function of being given by the ideal gas law that

42
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,110
follows from the definition we introduced last

43
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,160
time. And this work is just the integral from some

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,540
certain volume. What a final volume of that

45
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,220
pressure as a function of volume. Times are

46
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,950
integrated over the change in volume. And this

47
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,050
we've seen is one way to change the internal

48
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,860
energy of our ideal gas and its container. But it

49
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,850
is not the only way. In general, we're going to

50
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:52,690
have the highest entropy. We have that the change

51
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:58,740
of energy is just the work. But more generally, we

52
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,120
could have other. Contributions changing the

53
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,510
internal energy that also changed the entry of the

54
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,740
system, and that is where we pick up this morning.

55
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,210
With the concept of heat, so the way to introduce

56
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:20,720
heat and move beyond changes in energy coming from

57
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,350
constant entropy changes in volume is vital to

58
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,830
keep the volume fixed along with the particle

59
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,060
number. And think about what happens as we change

60
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,000
the temperature of our ideal gas. So we have added

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,360
some container. We can heat up that container,

62
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,560
moving over some Bunsen burner, some open flame,

63
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,260
increasing the temperature of the gas inside it,

64
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,850
and therefore increasing its energy from the

65
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,630
relation that we derived in Unit four between the

66
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,170
internal energy of an ideal gas. And as

67
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,290
temperature, we found that the internal energy is

68
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,910
at the back of the screen directly proportional to

69
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,070
the temperature with the proportionality factor of

70
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,050
three times the number of particles. So even

71
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,060
though no work is done due to the fixed volume, we

72
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,600
still have a change in the internal energy coming

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,580
from this change in the temperature that we.

74
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:34,190
It's a tribute to something other than work. And.

75
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,880
As we've seen this additional change, the energy

76
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,270
is only possible if there is also a corresponding

77
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,990
change in the entropy. Here we have varnishing

78
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,490
work, the non varnishing change in internal energy.

79
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,040
And if we consider that change in energy could be,

80
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,640
we can recall that for both distinguishable and

81
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,370
indistinguishable particles. Depends on the

82
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,830
temperature only showed up in. Showed up in the

83
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,720
same way, in the same place. In the expressions

84
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,790
for both of these cases, and in particular, we had

85
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,090
the.

86
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,690
I'm right down on the margin here, just a reminder

87
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,540
that entropy was three heads in the sand would be

88
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,540
over the boy wavelength cubed for the case of

89
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,420
distinguishable particles and a smaller five

90
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:49,830
halves and. And Lord End times the cube with the

91
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,800
case in the sexual particles. The temperature is

92
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,640
only entering through that thermal wavelength.

93
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,310
Bringing in this factor of the logarithm of the

94
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,480
temperature to the three has power and the three

95
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,870
factors of this wavelength that go along with

96
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,790
cancel out the units in the volume. So it's.

97
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,230
Straightforward piece of calculation to consider

98
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,890
the change in entropy that corresponds to the

99
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,320
change in temperature and change in energy as we

100
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,160
imagine heating up or cooling down the system with

101
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,970
a fixed cooling.

102
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,770
Was used.

103
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,270
Lieutenant, for for all we have to do is look at

104
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:50,680
the differential factor of this rehab's. And T,

105
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,540
which if we push that differential through the

106
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,750
derivative of the logarithm of T is one of the T.

107
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,480
So we have a three haves and times that change in

108
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,690
temperature divided by the temperature itself and

109
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:13,350
the three haves and DETI we just saw was precisely

110
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,200
the change in energy that we have in this

111
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,000
situation with a fixed volume. So the change in

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,950
entropy is related to the change in internal

113
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:32,450
energy. With the. Factor relating them just being

114
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,410
the temperature itself or multiplying through by

115
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:41,540
temperature, we find that that's the change in

116
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,960
internal energy, the temperature times, the change

117
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,850
in entropy, which is what we're going to define to

118
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:55,340
be keets as opposed to work. So a alternative way

119
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,100
of changing the average internal energy of the

120
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:04,210
system. Through a change in the entropy, in

121
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:10,060
contrast to the work which changed the internal

122
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,540
energy while keeping the entropy fixed, in this

123
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:19,180
case, we have simplified things. We have isolated

124
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,650
the work by simplifying things through keeping the

125
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,580
volume of our ideal gas fixed, ensuring that there

126
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,600
is no work contributing to this change in the

127
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,750
internal energy that is key until a CO two. So

128
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,010
this is the infinitesimal definition of the heat

129
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,340
if we have some infinitesimal change in the

130
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:50,280
entropy and the internal energy. And the

131
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,080
temperature on all three of those being related by

132
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,920
the expression to be worked out for an ideal guest

133
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,910
last week, we can again. Consider larger scale

134
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,030
changes, integrating over some change in the

135
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:13,610
entropy from a. Initial state of the system, one

136
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,800
of those thermodynamic macro states characterized

137
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,530
by these large scale properties up to some final

138
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:28,050
entropy, keeping the volume fixed and identifying

139
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,750
this heat. Coming from this interview over the

140
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,500
whole process as a change in the internal energy.

141
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,470
If you look at some of the references, you may see

142
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,480
the heat and the work. At least when they are

143
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,230
expressing this infinitesimal way, referred to as

144
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:57,350
the Q and T W, I'm avoiding that fairly widespread

145
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,900
nomenclature just to emphasize that both the heat

146
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,860
and the work, whether infinitesimal or not, are

147
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,990
changes in the energy. And it's tempting to read a

148
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,560
key word as a change in heat or change work, which

149
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,160
in that sentence, in that context, doesn't really

150
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,490
make sense as the heat and word are themselves

151
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,180
changes in this derived quantity that we have in

152
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,390
the canonical example, the internal energy itself.

153
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,750
So questions about the definition of heat to go

154
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,710
along with work is ways to change the internal

155
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,120
energy.

156
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:53,340
And maybe there's one aspect of this that has been

157
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,710
implicit so far that maybe this won't make

158
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,500
explicit, which is to recall that first law of

159
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,210
thermodynamics, that energy is neither created nor

160
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,360
destroyed. So when we are changing this internal

161
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,900
energy, the canonical ensemble, we know we have

162
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:15,120
the setup that our system is informal contact with

163
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,030
this large thermal reservoir that fixes its

164
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,060
temperature as the starting point for the

165
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,570
canonical approach. So all of these changes in the

166
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:30,310
internal energy are in some way reflecting the.

167
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,580
Movement of energy into and out of our system

168
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,520
being exchanged with that thermal reservoir, and

169
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,270
we have defined the work and the heat in such a

170
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,930
way that both are positive when the internal

171
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:53,660
energy of our gas is increasing. Hopefully that

172
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,940
will come back a bit of the feedback I was hearing.

173
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,410
So when energy is flowing into the system from

174
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,780
that reservoir, from the surroundings in some way,

175
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,550
both the heat and the work will be positive. And

176
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,510
the opposite case, when we have a negative work or

177
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,960
negative heat, that means that energy is being

178
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,330
removed from our gas and placed into its

179
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,450
surroundings in some way, shape or form. And the

180
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,350
remainder of this unit will be looking into the

181
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,360
different ways, shapes and forms that this energy

182
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,340
exchange can be realized and.

183
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,680
So that is hopefully familiar once we start to

184
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,410
think about it, that. Energy is conserved and is

185
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,630
just flowing back and forth between the system and

186
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,090
its surroundings. The definition of heat that

187
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,370
we've introduced actually assumes that the same is

188
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,940
the case for the entropy as well, just like the

189
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,670
energy, the. Should view the interview not as

190
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,710
being created or destroyed, but is flowing back

191
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,800
and forth between the system and its surroundings.

192
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,390
So when this does is positive for responding to

193
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,510
heat flowing into the gas, we have the

194
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,470
corresponding flow of entropy into the system from

195
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,730
its surroundings. And flowing back out again when

196
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,770
that heat becomes negative.

197
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,660
And this is.

198
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,530
Useful in the context of the thermodynamic cycle,

199
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:38,940
to be sure that if we consider carrying out

200
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,390
various changes to our system, modifying the

201
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,690
central parameters in such a way that it can't be.

202
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,250
Expanding compressed heat and cool, but somehow

203
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,550
gets back to its initial stage, the same

204
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,510
thermodynamic macro state with all of these large

205
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,870
scale thermodynamic properties the same, in order

206
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:05,420
to do that, we need to ensure that the total

207
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,740
entropy in the system is not increasing so that

208
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,750
the processes are reversible and the system can

209
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:20,730
get back to its starting stage. That's a dig into

210
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,760
that a bit more in the next section as we look at

211
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,090
actual cycles, but that is. Essentially implicit

212
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,330
in the definition of a cycle, once we go around

213
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,390
some cycle, want to get back to the system, we

214
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:39,340
started in requiring some reversibility, the

215
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,420
conservation of the amount of entropy in the

216
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,720
system, along with the amount of energy so that we

217
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,120
don't run afoul of the second law of

218
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,990
thermodynamics.

219
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,580
And this actually gives us another Handal or

220
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,500
another perspective on these isotropic processes,

221
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,680
like the change in the volume that we use to

222
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:10,520
define pressure. We see that with. He's identified.

223
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,030
Has that change in energy times, the temperature

224
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:20,530
whenever the. Entropy is concerned the change in

225
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,860
entropy is zero or isopropyl process, there must

226
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,360
be no peak flow between. Our system and its

227
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,340
surroundings, which is known as idiomatically

228
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,180
process, so. Formerly, the adiabatic processes,

229
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,950
some change in the control parameters of our

230
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,880
system that we can carry out without transferring

231
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,840
heat between that system and its surroundings, and

232
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,580
thanks to our demand that these processes be

233
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,520
reversible so that they can be part of the dynamic

234
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,440
cycles and aliabadi process that is reversible.

235
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,050
Guarantees that the entered the entropy of the

236
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:11,350
system is constant during that process and in

237
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:15,580
practice, if we think about the types of changes

238
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,370
that we can do to the control parameters of a

239
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,890
system in order to realize this.

240
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:30,140
Going back to that example, the process of pushing

241
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:36,600
Pakistan to. You work on a gas or moving that gas

242
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,810
over flame to transfer heat into its.

243
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,490
The idea that these processes can proceed without

244
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,820
that formal contact between the system and its

245
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,190
reservoir, that was a starting point for the

246
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,520
canonical ensemble means that adiabatic processes

247
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:02,340
have to proceed quickly enough, that no heat is he

248
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,480
has time to be exchanged between the system and

249
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,540
its surroundings. In other words, adiabatic

250
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:14,520
processes are fast enough that they are over and

251
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,810
done with before he has a chance to be transferred

252
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,680
into or out of the system. And similarly, that.

253
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,030
Our assumption of reversibility also means that

254
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,450
entropy has time to be transferred through these

255
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,020
enigmatic processes, and if we think about the

256
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,560
opposite, rather than a very fast change of

257
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,890
parameters that is over and done with before he

258
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,550
has a chance to flow through that thermal contact

259
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:50,130
between the system and its surroundings if we take

260
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,970
a very slow process. Where?

261
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,220
We change the control parameters gradually enough

262
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,890
that as they're being changed, any and all heat

263
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:06,020
transfer has the opportunity to complete in full.

264
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,600
What that means is that this heat exchange is

265
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,330
ensuring that the system's temperature will remain

266
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,480
equal to the temperature of its surroundings, that

267
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,530
thermal reservoir, all of the any change in

268
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,850
internal energy is going to be able to balance out

269
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,980
in the temperatures through these two processes,

270
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,690
leaving us with these slow processes, keeping the

271
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,460
temperature constant as they proceed. And just

272
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,860
like the. Define the base word I still entropic to

273
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:51,430
be isotropic, to refer to a process with. Entropia,

274
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,420
we will call these slow processes with because of

275
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,150
temperature, isothermal and building on that same

276
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:04,390
record, ISO's for equal. And these are the

277
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:09,250
idealized, limited cases where real processes are

278
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,150
generally going to be somewhere between these two

279
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:18,220
extremes, and I would say that usually in practice.

280
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,720
The heat flow required to maintain a constant

281
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,670
temperature is something that is very slow indeed,

282
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,500
and so real processes are typically closer to the

283
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,280
idealise idiomatic limits where the process is

284
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,910
fast and there's not a chance for Keiter entropy

285
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,480
to flow. And we will see some examples of that

286
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,660
coming up, possibly in the story on Friday or

287
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,650
possibly next week's tutorial, and I'll just pause

288
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,310
before we go into something and then expose

289
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:59,630
themselves. We have. All of the ingredients that.

290
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,150
We will need for this.

291
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,380
Pressure, huge.

292
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:12,530
Work idiomatic processes and isothermal processes.

293
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,010
The next step will be bringing all of these

294
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,750
ingredients together to construct a full cycle.

295
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,630
Are there any questions before we move on to that

296
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,200
stage?

297
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,450
And hopefully, as we move on to this more applied

298
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:43,010
point in our work somewhere through with the most

299
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,830
of the definitions for this unit, we can start

300
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:50,330
actually doing things with the concepts that we

301
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,970
have defined and put in place.

302
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,480
I'll hop back just briefly to this equation. Sixty

303
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,570
two, I lost over one aspect of this going through

304
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,170
it, which is this. Expression, when you're

305
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,830
interviewing over the temperature as a function of

306
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:14,240
the entropy of the system, which is inverting the

307
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,680
usual.

308
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,030
Functional independence that we expect in the

309
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,360
canonical ensemble, if we, as always, keep the

310
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,950
party going over and fixed that out of some of

311
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,070
these expressions, we have been driving.

312
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,000
Especially in uniform last week, the internal

313
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,750
energy and the Entropia as functions of our

314
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,060
control parameters, the temperature and the volume

315
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,690
that we imagine we have the. Experimental

316
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:52,320
capability to modify at our will. We need to

317
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,290
assume that these emotional relationships are

318
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,620
inevitable, and in particular, we can think about

319
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,030
the temperature as a function of the other control

320
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:07,110
parameters, but now also the entropy, something

321
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,530
that is a derived quantity. The canonical example.

322
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,880
And something that will change as a consequence of

323
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,430
our experimental change of the temperature and

324
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,910
volume. But Reverdy, inverting this Malaysian

325
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,070
express the temperature as a function of the

326
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,980
entropy also allows us to express the internal

327
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,390
energy as a function of the entropy just through

328
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,050
the. Simple connection that we have between energy

329
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:42,340
and temperature, so of the dependence on the

330
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,700
temperature on interview is made explicit, that

331
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,450
carries through directly into the internal energy.

332
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:56,520
And we can. Consider how this internal energy is a

333
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,120
function of entropy and the volume of our ideal

334
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:07,840
gas. Responds or depends. On changes both in the

335
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,210
volume and of the internal entropy. So.

336
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,350
Considering this first order, a Taylor expansion

337
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,280
in both of these two variables, which becomes

338
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:27,410
exactly the limit of infinitesimal changes. If we

339
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:33,330
expand. The internal energy around the starting

340
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,450
point and entropy with that volume kept fixed. We

341
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,810
have a change in entropy times, the response of

342
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,270
the internal energy to the entropy with a fixed

343
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:42,750
volume.

344
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,870
And similarly, if we fix the entropy and look at

345
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,320
the response of the internal energy to a change in

346
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,940
the volume. And multiply that through by the

347
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,210
change in the volume compared to its starting

348
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:03,280
point. Taking the limit where these three changes

349
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:10,340
are all. Infinitesimal and recalling that. This

350
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,310
isotropic change, the energy with respect to the

351
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,640
volume was what we define to be the negative of

352
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,720
the pressure. And if we go all the way back to the

353
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,730
micro canonical example where the volume had not

354
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,820
yet been introduced, it was implicitly fixed, we

355
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,750
defined the inverse temperature to be the change

356
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:37,280
in entropy with respect to the conserved energy.

357
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,120
This here is just the inverse of that.

358
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,580
One over tea inverted gives us.

359
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,040
An expression I'll try to get on the same page

360
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:54,560
here,

361
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,780
moving the starting energy at the initial values,

362
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,780
we're expanding around to the other side. We have

363
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:09,020
the change in the energy. It's given by the change

364
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,790
in entropy at times the temperature. Plus, the

365
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,410
negative pressure times the change in the volume

366
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,850
or minus PDV, both of which we can recognize as

367
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:24,410
the keys and the work that we just introduced

368
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,210
yesterday and today.

369
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,850
And what this is, is a generalization,

370
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,570
regionalized form of that first law of

371
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:42,060
thermodynamics, the. Introduced a few weeks ago,

372
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,700
it is a sharper way of stating the fact that

373
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,620
energy is conserved.

374
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,340
Here, formulated by saying that any change in the

375
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,280
energy has to be due to the different ways that

376
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,750
we've introduced of transferring energy from our

377
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:07,040
ideal gas system. To or from its surroundings,

378
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:12,300
both by having those. Surroundings do work on the

379
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,120
gas or vice versa, or by having heat transferred.

380
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,910
Through a change in entropy with fixed point

381
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,430
between the system and its surroundings.

382
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,810
And this equation, sixty three of this generalized

383
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:36,660
first law of thermodynamics is the final piece in

384
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:40,880
the puzzle, the final ingredient that we will need

385
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,560
to. Carry out. All the processes necessary to

386
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,180
construct some dynamic cycles. The.

387
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,550
The equations that describe the behavior of an

388
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:02,770
ideal gas in this container of oil as being

389
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:06,540
mutilated by adjusting those control parameters,

390
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:13,480
the temperature. And the volume, and it may well

391
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,710
be useful to have these four equations. Lying

392
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,160
around for easy reference, even once you've moved

393
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,230
on from this point on the page for his record was

394
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:35,530
on the board for reference, we derived from

395
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,730
distinguishable and indistinguishable particles in

396
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:43,770
the internal energy, three hands, hands, the

397
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,300
number of times the temperature. And again, for

398
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,510
both of those cases, the entropy depends on this

399
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,700
combination of the volume times. The three has

400
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:02,770
power of the temperature. So that is nonsense.

401
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,540
We know that the.

402
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:19,060
Isotropic or adiabatic process with no flow of

403
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,370
entropy, whatever that product to volume and

404
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,730
temperature to the three times power is constant

405
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:30,560
and we have to the decimal system

406
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,200
that links the.

407
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,110
Macroscopic properties, synapses, the pressure,

408
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,730
body temperature.

409
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,460
Or any thermodynamic states to consider and then

410
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,480
what we just wrote down here, after developing the

411
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,410
concepts of

412
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,570
the two ways that we have to change the internal

413
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:06,540
energy market by changing the control parameters,

414
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:11,090
the heat is related to temperature. Times change

415
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:15,300
entropy. The word is negative pressure times

416
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,430
boiling with the negative side. We can recall by

417
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:23,490
thinking about the system we went through last

418
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:28,060
week. Increasing the internal energy by decreasing

419
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,810
the volume of the gas, squeezing things together

420
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,020
and the sorts of that sort of squeezing through a

421
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:43,320
piston is. One way we can consider to manipulate

422
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,560
the system and we can not distinguish between

423
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,330
changes in volume that are either fast enough to

424
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:55,980
proceed with no heat and entropy flow between the

425
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,280
gas and its surroundings or those that are

426
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,850
isothermal, proceed slowly, allow all of the

427
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,660
energy flow that's necessary to keep the

428
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:11,490
temperature of the system constant, the same value

429
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:17,660
as its the reservoir. So we now have two ways of

430
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,560
the two extremes of changing the volume.

431
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,870
And doing work on the system. Depending on how

432
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,630
quickly that proceeds can be anywhere between

433
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,820
these antibiotic and isothermal limits, it can

434
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:38,200
also be either that depression decreases the

435
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,870
volume to increase the internal energy or an

436
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,750
expansion point that is about increasing the

437
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,980
volume and consequently decreasing the internal

438
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,580
energy of the gas and potentially doing work on

439
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,890
the surroundings as an engine.

440
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,120
And just in the previous section, introducing the

441
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,930
concept of heat, we talked about fixing the volume

442
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,560
and increasing the internal energy of the system

443
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,920
by heating it up, adding or removing heat from the

444
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,820
gas. In that same context, clamping the system in

445
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:19,700
place allows that volume to be fixed and adding

446
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,150
heat.

447
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:27,500
Into or removing heat from the gas is always going

448
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:34,230
to necessarily change its entropy. On. We can do

449
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:37,710
that either with the volume or if we keep a

450
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:42,300
constant force on that piston while adding heat.

451
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,480
We can expect that change in the internal energy

452
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,690
to increase the volume, pushing the piston out and

453
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:56,620
potentially doing work on the surroundings,

454
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:02,190
connect that piston to a. You have to get it to

455
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:05,430
turn the wheel, to move our car forward or

456
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:14,110
backwards. And if we. Constructs in some sensible

457
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,990
way, a sequence of these sorts of manipulations

458
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,050
increasing or decreasing the volume of the system,

459
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:25,060
raising, lowering its temperature, the pressure we

460
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:30,740
can. Bring the system back to the same sort of

461
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:35,110
dynamic state in which it started defining a full

462
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,650
cycle.

463
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,000
And in particular, once we get back to that

464
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,530
initial thermodynamic status, we can repeat the

465
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:49,560
set of processes that took us around the cycle,

466
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,140
get back to the same set again, and just keep

467
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,100
repeating that over and over again, potentially

468
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:02,560
indefinitely. And the applications of these cycles

469
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,250
can be making use of the flow of heat through the

470
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,040
system from its surroundings to do work on the

471
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,940
surroundings, what we call an engine, specifically

472
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,720
a heat engine,

473
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:20,260
or if we put in some work into the system, we can

474
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,190
use that to remove heat or move heat around.

475
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:28,430
Allowing. A.

476
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,330
Change in the heat to change the temperature,

477
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:38,310
producing a refrigerator through just these

478
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:44,110
manipulations of natural gas in its container. Now.

479
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:52,540
There is a convenient way of representing these

480
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,300
sorts of cycles and more generally the

481
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,190
thermodynamic state of our ideal gas in this

482
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,880
container, which is to talk about just its

483
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,920
pressure and volume, which, thanks to these four

484
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:15,100
equations, specify to determine all of the large

485
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,030
scale dynamic properties that we are interested in

486
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,750
from the ideal gas law equation of state, we can

487
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,200
extract the temperature from that pressure and

488
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,210
volume with the number of particles and then from

489
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,880
the temperature particle number, the internal

490
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,800
energy, thanks to that simple relation to those

491
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,810
distinguishable indistinguishable particles in an

492
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:45,160
ideal gas. So what we can do to represent the

493
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,700
state of the system visually is.

494
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:56,870
Represented as a point on a diagram, a graph that

495
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:02,410
has the volume on one axis and the pressure on

496
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,880
another, which doesn't quite all fit on the screen.

497
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,350
This is an example of one of these pressure

498
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:17,520
building diagrams for PV diagrams that appear on

499
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,050
the vertical axis volume on the horizontal axis

500
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:23,970
when we.

501
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:30,380
Construct close cycles. Said that the system has

502
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,950
to get back to a starting point. We will expect to

503
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:37,280
see the lines on these PV diagrams that are

504
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,930
processes connecting initial states of our system

505
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:46,760
to final status through some change in the control

506
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,980
parameters. If we.

507
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:56,620
Placed together at. Cleverly designed sequence of

508
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,720
such processes that bring the system back to

509
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,700
starting point. Those sequences of processes will

510
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:10,760
be described by closed paths. Along with pressure

511
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:15,360
building diagrams, the example that's up on the

512
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,650
screen right now is looking at a particular

513
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,370
process.

514
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,820
In particular, the.

515
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,270
The expansion of the gas that we were just talking

516
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:32,130
about more abstractly, can you back that example

517
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:36,170
of a piston allowing that piston to be pulled out,

518
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,860
increasing the volume of gas? So. We start from

519
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,930
some initial states specified by the volume

520
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,830
knowledge and the pressure of the system, and we

521
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:56,970
slowly increase its volume to some larger value, a

522
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,560
final volume piece of F going slowly enough that

523
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,610
any and all heat transfer the system wants to do

524
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,660
with its surroundings has a chance to. To proceed

525
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:13,420
and keeping the temperature constant and producing

526
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:19,560
this type of curve on the PVC diagram that you

527
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:23,770
will just call an isothermal, so the ISO therm is

528
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:29,360
this process. Represented by this curved line

529
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:33,020
corresponding to isothermal expression or in this

530
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,600
case, expansion.

531
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:42,260
That line is that we will call myself Thurm and

532
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:48,790
keeping the temperature constant from Westlaw

533
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:52,280
because the temperature, the fixed particle number

534
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,850
requires the product. Of pressure times, volume to

535
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:02,530
remain constant, so this is the third, both the

536
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,350
temperature and the product of pressure and volume

537
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,040
are constant, which immediately tells us that as

538
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,490
the volume increases with a fixed temperature, the

539
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:18,430
pressure has to decrease leading to the former. Of

540
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:24,250
the line I've I've drawn here dropping. Dropping

541
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:29,290
the pressure as the volume becomes larger and if

542
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:37,570
we. Again, the. Pressure and volume in both the

543
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:42,730
initial stage has been at times the pressure and

544
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:47,560
volume in that final state piece of times BSF.

545
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,040
Requiring that those are equal in order to keep

546
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,250
the temperature equal, that immediately tells us

547
00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:00,740
that the final volume is proportional to the final

548
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,780
pressure is brought to the initial pressure

549
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:09,890
multiplied by. The ratio of these volumes, so.

550
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,930
With the we can see that the final volume is

551
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:18,230
larger than the initial volume, this confirms that

552
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:23,720
the final pressure is smaller than the initial

553
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,610
pressure. And if we.

554
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,930
We cast this in terms of the change of pressure

555
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:37,020
that built up as we expand the system slowly in

556
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,520
this isothermal way.

557
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,410
With the pullout, this constant factor of not. And

558
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,760
then just end up with the difference of this ratio

559
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:56,870
minus the initial pressure, not which is then less

560
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:02,600
than zero. Subtracting one from a quantity that is

561
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,470
less than one.

562
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,560
And I can finally.

563
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,090
Stop introducing new concepts and ask you

564
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:16,410
something about them just to check that everything

565
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:22,620
up to this point is is clear. So let me ask you,

566
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,950
if we had in one of these TV diagrams to

567
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,590
isothermal that crossed, that had the same point

568
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,480
of pressure and volume at some point, what would

569
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,420
that mean in terms of the relation between those

570
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,530
two isoforms?

571
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,620
Well, there's only one case in which two of can

572
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,860
cross and what you're thinking of. I know where

573
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,520
you're coming from. If we say those two systems

574
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:36,050
have different temperatures, then they can never

575
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,960
cross. They have to be parallel to each other. We

576
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,080
can see that by supposing what if the opposite

577
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,130
would happen, then those two systems would be at

578
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,580
the same point in the diagram, at the same

579
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,610
pressure and the same volume and that same number

580
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:55,430
of particles and therefore the same temperature.

581
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,410
And they would, in fact.

582
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,040
Be the same isothermal. By virtue of having the

583
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,390
same temperature, in both cases, the isothermal is

584
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:16,170
characterized by a fixed temperature. And that is

585
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,620
in turn related to any position or given by any

586
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:25,440
position on these PCB diagrams. And your answer is

587
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,190
anticipating the. The next I agree on water. I'm

588
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:36,080
drawn here to firms with different temperatures.

589
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:47,340
T and a t f. We're considering now some process

590
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,940
that is no longer isothermal, what is moving our

591
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:54,630
system from this initial temperature to not to the

592
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:59,570
final temperature to. And just to switch things up,

593
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,560
how make this a compression rather than an

594
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:09,110
expansion? So that we start off with some initial

595
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:13,070
volume that is larger than the final volume we end

596
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:13,520
up with.

597
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:18,830
And in just the same way that.

598
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,410
We saw the pressure fall for an expansion that

599
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,320
increased the volume we can expect to see the

600
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:31,550
pressure rise from its initial to its final value

601
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:34,680
as we depress the system and decrease its volume.

602
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,890
And now if we consider a fast compression and in

603
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,920
particular the limit of fast enough to be

604
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:46,370
idiomatic with no heat flowing into or out of the

605
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:53,800
system. We know that the. The rise in the internal

606
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,560
energy who responded to this compression is going

607
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:03,280
to be reflected by a rise in the temperature going

608
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,050
from this initial temperature to a final one. And

609
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:11,380
the way we can get a grip on what's happening in

610
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,380
this adiabatic process for, again, this.

611
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:20,640
Particular line in the TV diagram goes by the name

612
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:26,770
of an area that. In contrast to the two oil firms

613
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:29,820
that. Are drawn in blue.

614
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:32,820
We know that.

615
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:39,480
With the. Process proceeding fast enough that no

616
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,310
heat is transferred and. The connection between

617
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:47,310
heat and the changing energy and heat and the

618
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:52,730
change in entropy. We can see that in this

619
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,370
adiabatic process described by the media, that

620
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:59,830
line of the pressure point diagram, this constant

621
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,490
entropy condition, is wanting to be the product of

622
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:07,610
the volume times, the three power of the

623
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:12,640
temperature. It's going to remain constant as a

624
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,400
consequence of the definition of an antibiotic

625
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,050
process. Now, two things to figure out from this

626
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:26,680
relation. With the change in pressure is we

627
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:29,940
considered for the isothermal case as well as the

628
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,990
change in temperature. And I think there's just

629
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:39,590
time remaining to churn through some of the.

630
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:45,650
Calculations from the starting point of the

631
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,550
constant entropy through this process that relates.

632
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,520
Three times do the three ounce power of the

633
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,530
initial and final states, or in other words, that

634
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:04,730
final temperature is proportional to the initial

635
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,710
temperature, but the concept of proportionality

636
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:11,360
being, again, this ratio of volumes is zero over

637
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,730
the final volume. Now that the two thirds hour, if

638
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:16,420
we take the.

639
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,650
Brings both sides of this equation to the two

640
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:25,120
thirds power to isolate the temperature. The

641
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:33,590
overall change then pull out that zero. And have.

642
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,620
The difference between this race should be two

643
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:43,560
thirds power, minus one. And plugging in the ideal

644
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:48,630
gas law to express that initial temperature in

645
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:55,590
terms of the initial point, zero times V0. In the

646
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:56,790
AP diagram.

647
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:06,310
The diagram of the page so that the population can

648
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,360
stay visible.

649
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,550
You have this expression and the call that the

650
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,350
this is a compression with a final belief, smaller

651
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:21,810
than the initial volume, the. Confirm what was

652
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:27,360
drawn on that Peevey diagram. What the final

653
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,050
temperature is larger than the initial temperature

654
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:36,210
we are increasing. On a lower temperature rises to

655
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:38,910
a higher temperature, one that corresponds to

656
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,830
larger volumes of pressure for a fixed volume,

657
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,380
we're currently larger volumes for a fixed

658
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:46,890
pressure.

659
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:49,490
And.

660
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,650
I'm just running out of time and.

661
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:03,000
Maybe it would be. All right, to pause in the

662
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,900
middle of this calculation and starting fresh on

663
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,650
Friday, give a chance to review and put in place

664
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:14,730
the final piece of this Friday morning, seeing

665
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:17,880
what the corresponding change in pressure is for

666
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,470
this if you get a compression.

667
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:26,710
And in the meantime, we have the homework to keep

668
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:31,400
you busy and. If there are no final questions

669
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,170
about what we've seen so far today, we'll pick up

670
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:38,680
with the. Really, the last piece in this

671
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:41,300
thermodynamic process, you kind of put them

672
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:46,280
together into a particular cycle on Friday.

673
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:58,790
The last call for questions, if not to the

674
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:03,730
remainder of your day. The rain has stopped. Good

675
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:06,260
luck with the homework. I'll see you again later

676
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:06,770
this week.

677
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:09,280
Well.
