1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:08,120
I just heard the bells ringing over the wind, so

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,580
let's get started even though I'm still tracking down

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,070
all the bits and pieces I'm bringing in.  I guess the

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,790
place to pick up is where we wrapped up in

5
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,420
last week's tutorial, we had a discussion of well.

6
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,370
Maybe before diving into that, I can ask if there

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,250
are any questions about anything at all from, you

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,060
know, is this just a few hours ago, the this is

9
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,450
another chance in the tutorial context.

10
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,630
Without any more. Shouting to raise an issue, you

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,420
can't or I can ask how you got on with its

12
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,420
exercise of placing bounds of the entropy for two

13
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,670
spin systems that are in contact and are analyzed

14
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,330
as a whole, and they are canonical examples of the

15
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,320
total energy of those two systems is fixed and

16
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,110
allowed to share energy back and forth. And there

17
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,780
are some bounds on the entropy that we can derive

18
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,810
from that. Did that all go smoothly for you, for

19
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,030
that 10 speed system?

20
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:42,950
I am.

21
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,680
It's really nice enough that I forgot to put up

22
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,290
the security number for that.

23
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,130
That help.

24
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,800
Divans.

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:12,870
OK, so there is one. Three of.

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,750
So it's not out of the way.

27
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,570
With 10 spins, you can just go through and

28
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,230
enumerate all of these entropies and see what the

29
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,000
spread is, what sorts of numbers were. You coming

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,880
up with four new

31
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,480
systems?

32
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,260
What were you able to come up with numbers for

33
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,980
these men's?

34
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,640
All might be able to take a step back from just

35
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,540
jumping straight to the answers to these

36
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,470
inequalities and go through the pieces that are

37
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:41,390
showing up in them, this smacks and terms is if

38
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,120
you're going to have any.

39
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,590
Numbers for the the maximum.

40
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,580
Factor in the terms and one times have to for

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,830
particular division of the total energy between

42
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,270
the two or four, how many terms there are in total?

43
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,290
Fortunately, 10 spins is few enough that we can go

44
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,440
through the full calculation, if that's proved

45
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:38,220
sticky for you. So we have. Ten. Units of energy

46
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,180
and reset the magnetic field strength equal to one

47
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,140
and.

48
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,000
Could equivalently just work in units of strength,

49
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:57,160
so one possible way of distributing 10 units of

50
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:05,020
energy systems is to have all this in one of the

51
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,380
systems. None of it's in another.

52
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:10,980
And.

53
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,670
I kind of leave enough space, but here. There's a

54
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,750
Senate centuries between these two systems. So we

55
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,940
have all kinds of energy and neither one of the

56
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,390
two.

57
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,080
And what are the some of the other possibilities?

58
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,250
So this one corresponds to everything that's been

59
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,900
put in System 101, but even since then it's been

60
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,030
done system to

61
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,690
slot your.

62
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,270
What are some of the possibilities that can go

63
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,040
between these two limits?

64
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,700
So as we look, what's been reaction to this?

65
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:22,810
Still, you want some changes, we've see six terms

66
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,020
that answers that question and also a symmetry

67
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,260
between the six trials where the upper three or

68
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,220
just the. Interchange and reverse of the.

69
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,440
And then she needs energies, you want to relate

70
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,050
that to a number of ways, the number of microbes

71
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:52,530
that each of these systems that we have to get all

72
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,070
of. Forget the energy is distributed in this way,

73
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,220
so I will do the easy one that goes along with the

74
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,800
chocolate. There's only one way to have all the

75
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,490
things pointing out so that all publicity is one

76
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,310
is going to the.

77
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:23,590
A little bit more room between those two. Of. They

78
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,850
are the easiest way to go is to go down this

79
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,240
column, what is the what are the number of

80
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,000
microstates that we correspond to having those

81
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,470
minus eight units of energy in system one that.

82
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,650
As it happens, maybe I can step back and. To the

83
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:14,430
specter of war is just the binomial coefficient of

84
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,220
four of the ten storms

85
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,410
lined

86
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,730
up, the both of those cases.

87
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:35,140
The question then is. How does that generalize to

88
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,540
the intermediate or less trivial speed

89
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,510
configurations?

90
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,120
I can't quite hear the.

91
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,910
So for the. Evidence of energy, do we have?

92
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,430
The integration, of course, almost always been one

93
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:17,940
the opposite oriented, so she was turned down, she

94
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:24,040
was known for 10 ways of organizing. That would

95
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,910
seem to be any one of the ten. Each of those ten

96
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,320
is a different microstates.

97
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,660
So ships there as well.

98
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,910
And then the process continues as we keep slipping

99
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,940
additional standards, we have to choose on the

100
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,660
page, we tend to be quite a few.

101
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,720
What is the binomial factor?

102
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,520
Forty five. Yeah,

103
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,130
one in five said over to.

104
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:19,340
So that means there. No sweat lodge still

105
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,930
continues. And you

106
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,910
can use.

107
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,570
Seven, six, five, which. If my memory serves more

108
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,310
than twenty two to two to.

109
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:56,370
She had to double check that. And there were just.

110
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,910
One time and two to figure out the. Total number

111
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:11,520
of signs of term in the Senate. We started off

112
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,690
with so we are getting at one time and two, which

113
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,760
would be six to three inches of energy

114
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,200
is is one.

115
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:33,150
And then 10, 10 times to 10. Used to be used to

116
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,930
just extract know in and then forty five times one

117
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,200
hundred twenty one. Oh look, I had

118
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:54,140
54 of those two states with the most equal

119
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,410
distribution of states between the two. So next

120
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,420
year is be four hundred.

121
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,300
And the total. If you were to

122
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,930
sum up all of these terms. That might be dangerous,

123
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,340
but behind the screen here, you say. Paul is

124
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,440
five hundred.

125
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,390
So.

126
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:39,320
The. Battles that we begin this hour that we have

127
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,960
the logarithm of. This maximum value in the

128
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,330
natural place. Which I have.

129
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,120
Written down

130
00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:00,340
five nine is going to be hopefully smaller, not

131
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,590
too much smaller than the true entropy of the

132
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:08,100
stone wall, distributions of energy logarithm

133
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,550
turns out to be nine, six, five.

134
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,140
And then this in turn is going to be smaller than

135
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,650
the logarithm of six times fifty four hundred,

136
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,280
which is just logarithmic six. Plus the water will

137
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,780
be fifty for the water. The six is that one point

138
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:37,310
eight. So. Eight plus three point five hundred and

139
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:44,550
twenty three, nine out of percent in the bounds

140
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:49,530
that we compute just in half a chalkboard for this

141
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,810
case of an equals 10.

142
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,860
And in particular, I asked once I finished typing

143
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,600
up this tutorial exercise, asked what fraction of

144
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,950
the true entropy would be accounted for by just

145
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:13,680
looking at either one of these two divisions of

146
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,890
energy with the largest factor in the moment to

147
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,610
five ratio that highlighted the 10 percent spread

148
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,790
on both sides of these bounds. I can say that

149
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,760
eight point six or nine point seven is about one

150
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,440
percent of the entropy of the system is accounted

151
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:44,160
for just by either one of these two ways of

152
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,240
distributing the energy reasonably equally. Which

153
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,660
is.

154
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,790
A significant fraction, and we can expect to that

155
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:04,320
as an increases to the truly larger values of this

156
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,540
saturation of the energy by the most likely set up,

157
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,190
most likely configuration is going to become even

158
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,060
more precise.

159
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:27,840
Of course, going on from end equals 10 to 20, 30,

160
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,670
40 or so on might be a bit tedious to do in a

161
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,070
table like this. But it is it's just a bunch of

162
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,590
computing or computations following a very

163
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:47,270
well-defined set of instructions, which is why

164
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,050
another tab in the window that I have here is a

165
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,190
Python notebook where I just wrote down the

166
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:01,190
automated calculation of all of this. And I was

167
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,230
thinking I could even. This is a short enough

168
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:08,690
program, much of it being. Displaying results in a

169
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,690
pretty way, I could have written this live in the

170
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,100
tutorial, but I figured that would be especially

171
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,750
soporific on a Friday afternoon with the exciting

172
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,750
outside. So let's just. Walk through the crowd

173
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,730
quickly, it won't take long. Setting that whole

174
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,580
number of spins up at the top, which on my

175
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,890
computer, I just read it as an input argument. We

176
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,390
can do a quick, warm up exercise of checking the.

177
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,770
Multiplicities, the number of multi states in a

178
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:50,890
single system of 10 spins that. Correspond to each

179
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,620
of the possible energies that the macro economic

180
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:58,000
system can have, plus 10 all pointed against the

181
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,240
magnetic field, I pointed down to minus 10. They

182
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,650
are all aligned. You see that these multiplicities

183
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,580
are the familiar ones here, ranging from one to

184
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,760
two hundred and fifty two. And the corresponding

185
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,450
entropy is just the logarithm of that. Might as

186
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:21,550
well turn that off. Just a quick sound check that

187
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,490
things like the binomial coefficients provided by

188
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,310
a scientific python are behaving as they should,

189
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,890
and similarly that that the log here is in the

190
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:37,030
natural base. What we have is two systems in terms

191
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,720
of contact with a fixed total energy. Which can

192
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,640
also be converted into an input argument, and we

193
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,560
want to accumulate all of the terms in this cell

194
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:58,670
over at one time, said to right here the log of

195
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,940
which defines the total energy, the total entropy

196
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,630
of the system. So if we cycle over all of the

197
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:11,120
possible numbers and upward pointing spins in the

198
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,470
first system, we can get the energy out of there

199
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,490
just two times and plus minus the total energy of

200
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,050
10. That means that in order to have the fixed

201
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:27,010
total energy of minus 10, the energy from the

202
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,370
second system has to be the remainder. And we can

203
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,740
figure out how many upward expense that

204
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,760
corresponds to just by converting this formula.

205
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,800
Taking the.

206
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,830
The negative side there

207
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:53,090
and minus the energy divided by two. It may turn

208
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,050
out to be that more than. The total number of

209
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,750
available spins would be present in order to

210
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,310
satisfy the total energy supply, since we never

211
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,090
have the plus 10 spin system here appearing in

212
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,260
these terms. And in that case, we can just

213
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,430
continue to the next option until we're done. We

214
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,390
have to do is compute the binomial coefficient of

215
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,920
picking. I spin up spins out of the total. Picking

216
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,920
up to speed up spins out of control, the

217
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,910
multiplicities for the separate systems, multiply

218
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,970
them together, add them to the list, and then

219
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:41,190
we're done sprinting things out. So putting out

220
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,940
that whole list, we see no more or less than I

221
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:51,580
have a more. We can extract the maximum elements

222
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:56,230
in the array as this max variable we defined last

223
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,490
week, the sum of all the elements in the array is

224
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,700
that total element for the combined system. And

225
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,280
the length of the array is the number of terms

226
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,540
that we have. And then adding up and taking borgs

227
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,930
gives us an entropy bound with. Eighty nine

228
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,560
percent

229
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,770
saturation of the entropy from any one of the most

230
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:28,190
likely states. So with that set up, have to change

231
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,240
and to.

232
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,860
See the results for larger systems going to the

233
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,090
larger limit, see larger numbers are appearing at

234
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:43,230
the entropy bound now is getting more like the.

235
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,380
Few percent level, the 10 percent level and 94

236
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,390
percent of the entropy is accounted for in the

237
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,230
most likely.

238
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,770
Distribution of energies, which corresponds to the

239
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,490
same minus four, minus six appearing in either

240
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:05,970
system.

241
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:13,890
And I think the largest I could repeat this for

242
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,660
before I went into the limits of double precision

243
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,110
floating point arithmetic and and computers is

244
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,070
five hundred twelve spins in each system. See if

245
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,370
that worked, if truncated some of the outputs,

246
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:34,530
conveniently, you see that the.

247
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,250
Little spin configurations we would have to

248
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,420
consider are about ten to the power, three hundred

249
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,630
six with five hundred eight terms. So as we

250
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,880
forecast last week, the number of terms is

251
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,960
increasing linearly with the number of degrees of

252
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,560
freedom and the entropy bound is better than one

253
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,510
percent in particular, that same setup with.

254
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,350
Evenly distributed energies were evenly

255
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,010
distributed, upper point expense accounts now for

256
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,850
more than ninety nine and a half percent of the

257
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,980
total energy, the total entropy.

258
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:25,540
If I switch to the dot cam and. To get it in focus.

259
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,270
You see the summary for these numbers.

260
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,990
Looking at how.

261
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,560
All

262
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,520
right, let's see how the.

263
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,050
The of that single likely distribution accounts

264
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,230
for a greater, greater fraction of the total

265
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:07,300
entropy as an increase is coming from the prisons

266
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:12,460
here up to the ninety nine point six percent that

267
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,720
we just read in the second four five hundred

268
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,830
twelve spins, saw that the number is five hundred

269
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,670
of these rounded out our 307, which is where we

270
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,120
run into double digit level. And maybe the

271
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,610
interesting thing about this is the.

272
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,090
The way that it's always the even distribution of

273
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:46,290
schemes and energy that dominates the entropy or

274
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:51,820
presumably dominate the number of microstates, so.

275
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,040
This is.

276
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:04,150
Essentially at. They are trying to use a. Somewhat

277
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:08,810
poetic term. We've seen that.

278
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,580
More may be disordered states, the ones with less

279
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,010
special configurations where there is a.

280
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,870
What is possible ways of organizing the degrees of

281
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,240
freedom subject to the constraints in the

282
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,340
sophistical ensemble or dominating the total

283
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,850
entropy of the system? So if we were to prepare

284
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,550
these two speed systems in maybe one of the

285
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,220
special states with all of the energy was in one

286
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,070
and none of it was in the other, after we put them

287
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,370
into the contact about the combined system to

288
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:52,890
reach equilibrium, we would expect to see the

289
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,200
system mostly in this more evenly distributed.

290
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,210
Divisions of energy between them and that is just

291
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:10,510
a consequence of the number of is the entropy that

292
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,110
corresponds to that situation. So this is the same

293
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,520
as if we were to consider what would happen if all

294
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,880
the air in this room happened to be hanging out in

295
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,400
one of the corners. At some point, we would expect

296
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,430
it to expand out into the vacuum and become more

297
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,750
or less evenly distributed. And you would not

298
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:35,130
expect the opposite process to occur over here

299
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,800
that's currently in the room to spontaneously

300
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,640
coalesce in one of the corners, which is

301
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,250
convenient because it helps us breathe

302
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:49,350
consistently. But that sort of distinction between

303
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,310
how the entropy is, the various configurations

304
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,480
differ. And how we can distinguish this and how in

305
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,620
the way that systems evolve from situations with

306
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,820
low entropy to situations with high entropy and

307
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,030
not the other way around is the way in which

308
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,890
the forward motion of time emerges from the

309
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,630
underlying macroscopic dynamics.

310
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,330
So are there questions about this example? I will

311
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,870
will be able to upload these comments on the

312
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,160
campus later today.

313
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,580
Because if not only about halfway through the

314
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:47,530
tutorial for today and can change gears to look at

315
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,590
something that came up earlier this week,

316
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,560
which is one of the things that's creating some

317
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:02,840
entropy among organizations that have your. Which

318
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,240
was the.

319
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,220
Sterling's approximation to. The factorial

320
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,880
function was logarithmic, asked a Tuesday, I think,

321
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,220
whether that was in.

322
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,030
Familiar approximations that indicate much

323
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,630
response so we can dig into it in a bit more

324
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:38,330
detail, in particular to write it in one of three

325
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:42,920
progressively more rigorous and more refined, more

326
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,710
accurate ways. So to the leading orders that we

327
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:54,600
kept in class, Sterling's formula. Expands the

328
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:00,340
what rhythm of conflict will emerge in as and more

329
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,630
than what is then up to terms that are more likely

330
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,920
and that we will. Almost always neglect when we

331
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,920
use sterling silver lining in this market. But

332
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,220
it's worth seeing how the full expression is

333
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,670
derived and getting some appreciation for. How it

334
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:28,800
works and it is for glory. So if we exponentially

335
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,690
both sides of this approximation, we extract in

336
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:36,480
fact will itself. Probably of exponentially lower

337
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,580
than functions, just identified that logarithm

338
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,300
into the power N minus the exponential, plus the

339
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:52,490
acceleration of minus N reorganizes its B ratio

340
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:58,190
and other natural basti to the power n. And this

341
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,630
is the crude approximation that's several people

342
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,750
found in roughly the same time a few hundred years

343
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:11,400
ago. It can be made more precise with that look

344
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,930
and factor of being identified. As a

345
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,080
multiplicative square root to play and the

346
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:23,030
expression for in with itself, with an infinite

347
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:30,530
series of power, suppressed corrections. So terms

348
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,370
that come in with.

349
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:37,350
Computable concerns, ABC and so on is suppressed

350
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,690
by whatever and whenever squared and so on and.

351
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,920
Keep the equation one up on the screen there. One

352
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,000
interesting aspect of this overall approximation

353
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,890
is the fact that this series does not converge for.

354
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:06,570
Olga. It is now zero and the radius of convergence

355
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:15,090
is essentially some. Over AK. One over. Next to

356
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:18,510
the case, which I imagine you've seen in the past

357
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,620
and know to be diversions, really the series

358
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,780
should not be considered diversions or rather

359
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,070
esoteric, even though the radius of convergence

360
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:35,700
vanishes. If the series is truncated. At an

361
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:41,100
appropriate power after the term and is expected

362
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:46,530
to provide a maximum precise approximation to this

363
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,400
vectorial.

364
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,530
The next time we'll look at some of the examples

365
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:58,250
we've watched over in the lecture, but.

366
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,650
There are a few ways to actually derive Stirling's

367
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,070
for.

368
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,410
So. What is the easiest that gives the weakest

369
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,530
constraint doesn't actually drive reform itself,

370
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:21,580
again, focuses on balance somewhat similar to the

371
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:27,720
ones being extracted for the last week. And.

372
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,930
And try to see how much of this.

373
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,800
A piece of notes I can fit onto the screen here.

374
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:48,720
There are three derivations in here of increasing

375
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,410
complexity. The first being just to. Drive to

376
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:58,430
balance on the water and vectorial for sure that

377
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,110
this is less than mile and which should be

378
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:07,780
reasonably straight forward and then. The other

379
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:12,040
tests show that in Victoria, those also greater

380
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:17,500
than and Morgan Minocin for much greater than

381
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:24,420
Warton, so. Once you were able to. Establishes the

382
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:29,100
equation to than just divided through by that and

383
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:37,750
again. Will. Give the result that. We will give

384
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:44,400
the medium term instruments for Chauvins. As Ed

385
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:48,440
goes to zero is and goes to infinity is one of the

386
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,640
more than correction points to zero this morning

387
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,690
in factorial asymptotically and Baillargeon Limits

388
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:59,420
is the same order of magnitude as an apple that

389
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,820
extracts that medium term.

390
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:08,980
So poised for. Maybe five minutes to let you drive

391
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:14,800
those inequalities, and if you. Is too much time

392
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,780
you? Wrap up with them quickly. You have already

393
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,780
the next step is going to be manipulations of the

394
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:28,250
gamma function that can be related to any

395
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,160
factorial. So leave that up on the screen for a

396
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,280
few minutes, pause the recording while you work,

397
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,460
and then come back to look at the second round of.

398
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,010
Derivations for Serling's formula.

399
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:53,170
I guess before I posed any questions about this

400
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:53,860
post here.

401
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:04,470
It's the shaking heads, so. Paul. Recording is

402
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,870
resumed and check in to see if

403
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,400
there are too many qualities here to start off

404
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:11,700
with.

405
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:20,180
He has. Wants to share how those can be derived.

406
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,850
Maybe I should ask, first of all, who believes

407
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:34,990
those McMullan's?

408
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:43,470
Scream and. Do they seem. Reasonable.

409
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,490
So it's.

410
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,420
I saw now and so does anyone able to.

411
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:11,340
Thrive is this battle between, say, the. The upper

412
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,930
limits on the logarithm in factorial, so if we

413
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:26,040
want to show that one is one more game, this is

414
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:33,090
equivalent to the size and. Saying that, in fact,

415
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:37,650
itself is less than exponential. But then when it

416
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:43,150
comes to power and rearranging, that's exponential

417
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:43,720
like Mr..

418
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:51,500
Is that is our folks happy with? That how do we

419
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,100
see whether or not that is the case?

420
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,420
You can't do induction, though, that maybe even to

421
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:09,970
fall for my inclinations, I just see that.

422
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:24,570
Specify in greater than one year of damage to one.

423
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,920
Whereas it's the

424
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:36,350
same number of troops all the way down to. We have

425
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,270
created more so and in any case, and is greater

426
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:45,710
than and minus one, it's products of a strictly

427
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,850
positive integers.

428
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:56,850
Implies that until the end is larger, that you

429
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:04,030
were reversing things and what is less than.

430
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,410
So that's

431
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,340
one down.

432
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:20,700
And that was the easy one, as you can see there,

433
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:24,700
any ideas for what to do about that? Second,

434
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,880
inequality, trying to show? That.

435
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,490
With less

436
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,020
than.

437
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,320
So what it's like here

438
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,360
is some water

439
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,200
and I've read.

440
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,490
That is true, false.

441
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,030
Of the.

442
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:31,550
Let's

443
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,390
go back to.

444
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,170
So.

445
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,420
And that's.

446
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,250
You want to travel to the border and write it down?

447
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:04,340
I can't pause the report again, that would.

448
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:11,930
The more comfortable. The recording back on just

449
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,850
before accountability, I think that argument does

450
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,910
does hold. I haven't gone through all the steps.

451
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:27,050
The trick that I like and which uses me is to give

452
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:32,590
the Palestinians more exponential tools, certainly

453
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,060
the Taliban, which is one plus one over and over,

454
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:42,330
two and square and so on, towards the settlement

455
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,490
from zero to infinity of.

456
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,360
Organic tools into this.

457
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:05,970
And I consider from that song The Sweet.

458
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:16,410
I know that not the F term. Within the cells,

459
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:20,700
there are additional type terms, some as a whole,

460
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:29,910
through isolation equal from Japan over inject a

461
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:35,250
little, rearrange the factorial to the left of the

462
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,050
inequality.

463
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,260
And in the end, to the rights

464
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:52,860
of the expression was opened up there as well. So

465
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:58,470
that is a good way of pointing out arguments that

466
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:05,480
I find amusing. So. Running out of time for today,

467
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,640
wrap up there and leave the second option, the

468
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,510
third derivations for you to think about just on

469
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,780
the second one, looks at the example function and.

470
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:25,010
Uses this to restore what's called weather

471
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:29,180
integral, relating confectionary to a simple

472
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,230
isidoro with the

473
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:37,490
complexity and an exponential minus X integrated

474
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:45,700
over the X and then if you. Look at this function.

475
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:52,300
Next to the N minus, and it's plotted here.

476
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:57,770
In the solid line, we can approximated by a

477
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,140
Galician tradition integral. And from that,

478
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:07,600
Russian people extract the. A square root and

479
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,450
factor that needs to be logarithmic chart

480
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:15,310
instruments formula. I'll leave that for you to

481
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,640
play with over the weekend. We'll pick up on

482
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,630
Monday with more about the physics of information

483
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:28,930
and develop into your ideal. Any questions to to

484
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,760
wrap up the week?

485
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,880
Take care of the wind. It doesn't get too

486
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,720
unpleasant out there. We'll see you next week.

487
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:53,630
Oh.
