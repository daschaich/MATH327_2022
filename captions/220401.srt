1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,560
So we may as well get underway.

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:15,110
Let's deal with the six-digit number before I forget.  For this morning, it is three six

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,240
nine nine three zero.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,380
So, we've reached the last day before the spring break,

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,370
though it feels less like spring out there than at this

6
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:37,830
time last week. And we have gotten

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,900
through Unit 8 on quantum gases of bosons

8
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,480
and fermions with enough speed that we

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,390
have this hour to get a bit more into some of

10
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,210
the fun details justifying some of the claims and

11
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,280
approximations that we went through earlier.

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,850
Before digging into that, we can just recall the

13
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,670
brief recap without running things down, since we

14
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,970
are changing gears just a little bit. That's so

15
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,540
far this week we focused on Fortum gases, the

16
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,810
fermions looking both at the non relativistic low

17
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,530
temperatures where we approximated this very

18
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,120
function as a step function. Michael responds to

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,290
all energy levels filled up, to be fair, energy

20
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,340
equals to the chemical potential view at zero

21
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,460
temperature and then all higher energy levels

22
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,830
unoccupied or empty. And this had interesting

23
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:48,380
effects, both in producing a value for the average

24
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,990
particle number, an average natural energy that

25
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,650
we're independent of the temperature, as well as a

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,390
non-zero degeneracy pressure that was also

27
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,270
independent of the temperature remaining zero even

28
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,540
at the limit of absolute zero, and is responsible

29
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,370
for processes known as type one supernovas that

30
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,330
have been of great utility to astrophysics and

31
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,140
cosmology. And we then looked a bit more briefly

32
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,290
at the opposite. The ultra relativistic Fergana

33
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,550
gases motivated by neutrinos, which are very

34
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,620
nearly massless particles coming up with a

35
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,200
equation of states that limit that looked a bit

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,470
more like what we are used to, almost exactly the

37
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,830
same as the photon gas, just different by a factor

38
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,000
of seven six. So about 20 percent different

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,300
numerical factor in the usual relation, TV

40
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,520
proportional to a..

41
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,560
And today.

42
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,560
The plan is to. Build on the novelistic side of

43
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,600
things a bit by asking what happens if we have a

44
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,930
small but not zero temperature to the extent that

45
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,760
we cannot approximate this very function as a

46
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,560
simple step function to a reasonable level of

47
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,100
approximation? We can start to try to start by

48
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,230
asking if there are any questions about what we

49
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,020
have seen this week and the main topic of this

50
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:37,230
that. We want to go beyond what was. Initially in

51
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,130
the syllabus on the topic of quantum gases of

52
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:47,100
fermions, just to illustrate one application where

53
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,610
it is indeed necessary to go beyond that low

54
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:56,100
temperature approximation of the Fermi energy as a

55
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,930
step function, which is if we consider the heat

56
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,640
capacity as the derivative with respect to the

57
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,520
internal energy, the derivative of the internal

58
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,300
energy with respect to the temperature. From the

59
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,510
approximation. Of this family function as a social

60
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,470
function, reminding you here what that full family

61
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,850
function is essentially the. Fairly direct

62
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,740
occupation, number four, an energy level with this

63
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,830
energy e

64
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,000
approximating this as a step function, which is

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,180
exactly correct, only the limit of the temperature

66
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,720
going to zero corresponding to the rest of it be

67
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:44,350
to go into infinity. Then the temperature

68
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,130
independence result for the energy gives us

69
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,860
ignition key capacity, the capacity going to zero.

70
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,170
So we have essentially no information about how

71
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,650
the heat capacity behaves at zero temperature,

72
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,760
what it is related to and with what numerical

73
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,970
factors. And as we saw in last week's tutorial, is

74
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,840
heat capacity is one of the most convenient things

75
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,480
for experimentalists to measure. So it's

76
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,690
worthwhile. Give me a solid prediction for how it

77
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,760
behaves at low temperatures as opposed to in the

78
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,410
limit of absolute zero temperature.

79
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,460
The starting point for this analysis is to go back

80
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,040
to the sort of expression that we had for

81
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,500
political number and think about. What to do with

82
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,800
it when we cannot approximate the very function as

83
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,050
a step function, which is our earlier calculations,

84
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,870
just killed off the whole range of this integral

85
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,090
about equal to you and brought in the factor of

86
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,690
use of the three has. Just the cost of

87
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,080
proportionality in front of it and for convenience,

88
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,040
both in this calculation and if we circle back to

89
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,740
look at those Einstein conversations in the

90
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,320
tutorial after the break, it's convenient to

91
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,850
package. Everything apart from that family

92
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,810
function as some other function, what is known as

93
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,810
the density of estates. So this. Combination of

94
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,800
volume times, the square root of two times the

95
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,680
part of the mass cubed times, the energy all over

96
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,470
the square root and the normal factor pi squared

97
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,640
plus constitute.

98
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,380
Is essentially here just a shorthand that we could

99
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,890
do without that becomes convenient, as you will

100
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,160
see, we're going through the calculations and all

101
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,290
those constants. We can just package into a single.

102
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:55,650
The variable juice not. That we can plug back in

103
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,130
once we've gone through all of the manipulations.

104
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,190
And the density of states is essentially what it

105
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,550
says on the tin. It is the number of single

106
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,090
particle energy levels for some physical energy

107
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:14,440
states now expressed as a density, not per unit

108
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,970
volume, but per unit energy. So density of states

109
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,670
is a function of the energy. And we can read this

110
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,980
equation one hundred seven for the average

111
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,880
particle number to be the integral over the number

112
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,800
of energy levels given energy range multiplied by

113
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,290
the very function that gives us the probability

114
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,820
for each of those energy levels to be filled as a

115
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,290
function of that energy. So these two plots here

116
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,980
grab from one of the textbooks in the recommended

117
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,190
supplemental material in the lecture. This is.

118
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,650
Showing how the states, the states and the

119
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,550
integral more generally work out, but in the case

120
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:07,770
of zero temperature on the left where the family

121
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,740
functioned as a step function, it guarantees that

122
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,630
all states up to the energy are filled, all of

123
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,450
those with the higher energy or empty that shaded.

124
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,470
Which corresponds to field versus MPU states and

125
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,950
the total number of particles manages to go over

126
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:30,250
that shaded area and the density of states times

127
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,300
their step function. And once we. Go to a.

128
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,260
Strictly positive, but still small temperature, we

129
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,050
pick up some non-zero probability for energy

130
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,480
levels with values of the energy larger than the

131
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,100
energy use of F to be filled. And this did not

132
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,860
come out so well that the overall. No particles

133
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,360
now. Is the area under the solid curve that

134
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,870
multiplies together the density of states,

135
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,840
essentially the square root e times, the constant

136
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,070
and the primary function, that's exponentially

137
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,030
suppresses the probability of energy level with

138
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,700
higher energies being occupied? And one other

139
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:25,500
thing we can note. About. This way of visualizing

140
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,090
things is that for every one of these. Higher

141
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,200
energy levels that is occupied, the particle

142
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,130
occupying it

143
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,680
at caesura temperature would fit within the range

144
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,530
given by the Fermi Energy. So there is a one to

145
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:49,790
one correspondence between these occupied higher

146
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,340
energy levels in the unoccupied.

147
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,320
Lower energy levels to the left of that Fairbury

148
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,030
energy at lower energies and the feminine energy,

149
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,900
we can also see that that's due again to the very

150
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:12,080
energy being set by. The average number of

151
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:18,950
particles, so that that vertical line, the energy.

152
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,610
Is just counting the number of particles in the

153
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,750
occupied states and the rate of it must match up

154
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,980
one to one with an occupied state to the left. One

155
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,270
other feature of this plot at non-zero temperature

156
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,380
is that the chemical potential now no longer

157
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,040
exactly corresponds to the fear of the energy. If

158
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,580
we go back to the purity function just briefly, we

159
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,660
can see that when the energy equals the chemical

160
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,200
potential, the argument of an exponential function

161
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,320
vanishes. So zero is one and the energy reduces to

162
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:09,250
one over one plus one half. And this happens at a

163
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,190
value of energy that approaches the Fairbury

164
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,080
energy and the zero temperature limit and is

165
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,310
smaller than the thermal energy for non-zero

166
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:27,910
temperatures, which is a claim that we can confirm

167
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:34,630
by actually going through the evaluation of these

168
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,750
bills, both for average particle number and

169
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:44,420
average internal energy. That's. As we saw in our

170
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,630
earlier work, differ only by the presence of an

171
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,840
extra factor of the energy being carried by

172
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,940
particles that are being counted.

173
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,990
So before diving into the mathematics of how to

174
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,810
evaluate this as you go through this check to see

175
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,260
that no questions about the basic motivation or

176
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,780
setup we're going to here.

177
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,440
And not seeing any. You will go through what is

178
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,200
called the Somerfield expansion, something that

179
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,640
was mentioned last week, I think with the

180
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,640
temperature independence limit being just the

181
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,600
first term in this expansion. And what we will see

182
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,590
is that the Somerfield expansion is really just a

183
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:37,940
glorified timber expansion where the real work is

184
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,040
done in setting up the problem in a form where it

185
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,620
faler expansion that can be justified looking at.

186
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:52,130
The stuff is complicated integrals that involve

187
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,220
square roots of energy divided by exponential

188
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,930
functions in the energy. So the first step in

189
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:06,110
Zurfluh expansion is to integrate by parts. And

190
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,470
because it's been a while since you've done

191
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,340
integration bypass, I'll just remind you of the

192
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,010
schematic setup that we have something to go and

193
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,900
we can express as a function. You times the

194
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,120
differential factor of the different function.

195
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:26,200
D.V. and this is equal to, again, schematically,

196
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,370
the product of those two functions. You would be

197
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:34,130
evaluated the integration minus the integral of

198
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:40,190
the function v the differential to you. So to

199
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:47,040
apply this integration by parts to integrated. Of

200
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,560
the average particle, no. What we do is identify

201
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,330
that function, you as the family function itself,

202
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,250
which we're no longer approximating as a step

203
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:04,140
function, and then DV is everything else. So that

204
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,540
square root, the times, which means that the

205
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:15,160
corresponding function V. Is each of the three

206
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,200
halves power with a two thirds in front to cancel

207
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,540
off the power and get back to that differential

208
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,690
for so.

209
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,740
Putting in this identification into the integral

210
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:39,190
that we have, we have you times V is. Two thirds

211
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,300
energy, the three times that fermenters year

212
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,650
function you evaluated at energy equals zero and

213
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,090
infinity, and then we subtract off two thirds of

214
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:57,980
the integral zero to infinity. Of the three times

215
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,760
the differential over you, which is the derivative

216
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,470
of the family function. Times the differential to

217
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,570
now.

218
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,810
The first term was called the boundary term, we

219
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:19,210
have particularly simple results, we've seen that

220
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,690
that Fermoy function is always some number between

221
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,750
zero and one. So with some finite number is

222
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,940
multiplied by zero zero. And the limit where the

223
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,580
energy goes to infinity is to pull up every

224
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,510
function again and look at that for any non-zero

225
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:44,160
temperatures will find a better. As he goes to

226
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,040
infinity, the exponential factor is large, the

227
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,550
fear, the energy goes to zero zero again. So all

228
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,360
of these battery terms. They both the initial go

229
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:02,120
to zero. And we can repackage the remainder of the

230
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,620
integral as two thirds. I was the integral of

231
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:13,730
minus derivative of the function and the energy to

232
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,280
be free Avesta

233
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:18,920
and.

234
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:26,260
Looking at the. Negative, integral with respect to

235
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,820
energy of the family function, she can achieve the

236
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,310
end of energy, minus the potential plus one to the

237
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,960
minus one power. Taking the derivative of that

238
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:46,600
brings that exponential factor. Down into

239
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,030
numerator with that extra power squared, and then

240
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:57,190
the chain will move with minus one factor for the

241
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:02,500
power cases up front, the chain rule then gives us

242
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:10,620
a factor of theta times due to. So that's why this

243
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:10,980
new.

244
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,550
And we can change variables to make this a bit

245
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:22,440
more compactly, especially to the X, X plus one.

246
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,410
Involving the X plus one squared where X is this

247
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:33,530
combination. Of the difference in energy minus

248
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,460
chemical potential.

249
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,010
So plugging that in to the

250
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:49,000
grid that we have, we end up with. Same two thirds

251
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,320
integral from zero to infinity will now be able to

252
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,210
go over this. One of the X.

253
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:06,010
And you can just rate. The integrated. Is the X?

254
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,440
Over the years, plus one squared.

255
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,700
Times either the power of three has taken that

256
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,240
data from the. Derivative you and bringing it into

257
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,080
a differential factor which could be recognized as

258
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,610
the differential factor of.

259
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:35,380
X with the ID, that one equals zero at the lower

260
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,680
level of integration, X is minus the Times MU. So

261
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,340
we out of.

262
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,960
Terms of. X with just this residual. Factor of

263
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,690
energy to the three house power left over.

264
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,280
But this expression here that if you drive.

265
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,100
If we plug in the overall collection of constants

266
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,180
zero that appears in the density of states, it was

267
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,280
Eurocracy factor relating the average particle

268
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:18,000
number to this particular integral. And it might

269
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,300
be the question, why go through the trouble of his

270
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,730
credit cards just to end up with something that

271
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,490
looks like such a mess with ratios of exponential

272
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,000
and a term that has already that is now related to

273
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,910
X and someone that obviously the advantage of

274
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:44,310
doing this, which. Sommerfeld, that was smart

275
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,510
enough or skilled enough to see and we can

276
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,010
appreciate by looking at the figure at the bottom

277
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,570
of this page, is to recognize that by casting the

278
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,970
integral in this for. We have something that is.

279
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:04,320
Exponentially suppressed both in the region of

280
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,900
large X, where that the denominator is

281
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,660
approximately E to the X squared, in the case of

282
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,420
the other people, the X with the numerator, we end

283
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,090
up with one over an exponentially worse number,

284
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,650
but it's also exponentially suppressed. The

285
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:27,350
opposite of it when X is a very negative number,

286
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,860
margin lending to small zero, where the

287
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,150
exponential of a large negative number is much

288
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,520
less than one. And the.

289
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,980
Overall, integrated is then or can be expressed as

290
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,430
one over another, exponentially large number

291
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,500
exponentially with minus X, which is a much larger

292
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,870
one, and the remaining factor of X of the three

293
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,870
halves coming from that energy. Can't really do

294
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,550
anything about an exponential factor. Suppressing

295
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:09,340
things, and I've left that. That could be the

296
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,760
three halves of the plot here, what we could see.

297
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:21,120
Is it sharply function around? The region where

298
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,050
the energy is equal to the chemical potential,

299
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:29,070
this combination is being the time square minus

300
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:33,690
new, centered around zero. And this rapidly dies

301
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,790
off as this combination of quantities becomes even

302
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,090
just

303
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,470
a factor of a few. And certainly by the time we

304
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,420
are five, there's almost nothing left in the tail

305
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,740
on either side of this function. The important

306
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,160
thing is the appearance of BITA and that

307
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,200
accommodation, which means that. If we fix the

308
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,870
temperature at a low value that corresponds to a

309
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,860
large volume of beta, then we don't have to shift

310
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:12,980
very far away in absolute terms of the energy from

311
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,550
away from that chemical potential in order for the

312
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:23,240
Interbrand to be completely negligible. So this

313
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,180
factor of five that I pointed out here corresponds

314
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,840
to the absolute value of embarrassment greater

315
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,240
than about five times the temperature. So the

316
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,310
lower the temperature, the quicker this

317
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,580
exponential suppression sets in.

318
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,620
And that is the. The Senate version of the bill

319
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,770
came up with, which allows two approximations

320
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,480
valid at low temperatures, the first of which is

321
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,840
to simplify the structure of this integral change

322
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,560
of the lower limit of integration that was minus

323
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:12,290
daytime's view. If we consider the. The limit of a

324
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:19,220
large data set to something greater than you might

325
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,890
be under 10 or more, you can see that.

326
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,630
Emerging, this region of integration is bringing

327
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,070
in all the major contributions that don't show up

328
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:40,530
in this plot from a region of very small X, so we

329
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:44,070
are free to include those in with the integration

330
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,960
domain that. Is it more convenient to work with?

331
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,230
When we actually try to evaluate these integrals

332
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,930
in order to put that back on the screen there, in

333
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,970
order to actually evaluate these integrals, we

334
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:05,040
need to handle this factor of each of the three

335
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,660
hands, which is a second approximation we can do

336
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:14,460
through a Taylor expansion. I mentioned expanding

337
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:20,500
the energy around MUE. Precisely because this is

338
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,310
the region where the integration is not negligible

339
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,790
and this becomes a very narrow region as the

340
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:34,540
temperature decreases, so the first few terms in

341
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,360
this Taylor expansion, we start off with just that

342
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,870
central value, usually the three halves, and then

343
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:44,310
take the derivative of each of the three as set

344
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:49,330
equal to view and multiply that by the linear

345
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,150
factor so that derivatives just brings down the

346
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:57,520
power. Three halves we set to view the remaining

347
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,870
square root factor and the next term does the same

348
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:05,350
thing with the second derivative. So we bring down

349
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,310
first. A factor of three has been another factor,

350
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,270
one half gets three quarters tops. Another factor

351
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:16,020
of one half gets three eighths. The square

352
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:21,000
displacement is minus two. And now the result of

353
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,770
two derivatives into the three halves is key to

354
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:28,470
the minus half. That is set to the chemical

355
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:33,390
potential, which we can now rewrite in terms of

356
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,330
integer powers of X.

357
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:39,740
This.

358
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,090
We recall, oops. Is.

359
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,400
This actor, by the time, has the energy Midas

360
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,240
chemical potential. So each of these is new terms,

361
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,110
is a power of X over data. And by virtue of having

362
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:04,250
X raised to an integer power in the resulting

363
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,290
integrals, it becomes something much more

364
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:10,810
tractable than trying to integrate the square root

365
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,630
of execute.

366
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,310
So. If we just rewrite those babies as we're in

367
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:24,670
terms of the temperature we have. A few leading

368
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:28,410
terms for the average particle, no, in terms of

369
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:33,010
particles that we can consider one by one. So the

370
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,860
first term in this expansion is just the constant

371
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:39,070
attention to the three halves that gets pulled out

372
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:44,220
of this integral over. Frightened to go of the X

373
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,730
over the X plus one square, so we need to evaluate

374
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,690
that. We need to evaluate the next term that has

375
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:56,970
one factor of X showing up alongside the

376
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,030
exponential factors and of the extremities, the

377
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:05,100
powers of X, so X squared times the X over the X

378
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,670
plus one.

379
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,080
In the interest of time, I'll just charge through

380
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:16,850
these integrals. Show you how they're done that

381
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:22,420
rather than leaving them for you to work on. The

382
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,740
trick to the first interview was to go back to.

383
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,420
The integration by parts we did a few minutes ago

384
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:36,000
and recognize that this. It's the X or the X plus

385
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,980
one squared is closely related to the derivative

386
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,970
of the family function, in particular, if you keep

387
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:50,400
track of all the factors, the data can see that up

388
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,450
to a negative sign. This integration is just. The

389
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,610
derivative of that very function as a function of

390
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,420
energy integrated over that energy rather than

391
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:11,310
over X, as we have defined it, like the integral

392
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:16,740
of a derivative, just gives us the value of that

393
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,820
function. That's why it is the. Antiderivative,

394
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,970
and this is evaluated, but the energy is minus

395
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,680
infinity to infinity,

396
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,940
recalling that very function that we have here is

397
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,620
just integrated between zero and one. This limit

398
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,230
where the energy is plus or minus infinity is

399
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,220
exactly where this function becomes zero or one.

400
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,500
So when the energy is infinite, this is a very

401
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,040
large exponential factor for a non-zero up finite

402
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,460
or any finite data, which is the right temperature

403
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,570
and whatever. A very large number, then infinitely

404
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:06,200
large number. Those to zero to the other limit of

405
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,600
E going to negative infinity again for a finite.

406
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,300
We have a very small number and B for every

407
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,480
function goes to one. So that's what that integral

408
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,640
is, just one.

409
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:29,170
The second integral. We can do a similarly simple

410
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:36,760
calculation just by. Expanding out the square in

411
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,540
the denominator's, this is two powers of the X

412
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:47,590
plus one. And then if we divide through by X in

413
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,390
the numerator, we end up with. Is the integral of

414
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:57,130
X over one of those factors, B, B, B, X, plus one,

415
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,720
the dividing through gives us one plus E to the

416
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,470
minus X over X. And we can see that this

417
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,370
denominator now is symmetric if we exchange the

418
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,980
gate X, so replacing X goes to Windows X, we just

419
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,420
swap these two terms in parentheses. So that is an

420
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,740
even function in the denominator. It's obviously a

421
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,430
function of the numerator. I heard the results

422
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:33,450
coming from from you already, the integration of

423
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:38,020
an overall odd function. Across a domain, that

424
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,500
symmetrical ground zero is indeed zero, and this

425
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,910
would actually hold for.

426
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,390
All of the higher terms in this Taylor expansion

427
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:54,350
that you have. The powers of X in these tentacles,

428
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,480
so we can already know that the T cubed term here

429
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:03,480
is going to vanish and the fourth is going to be

430
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,970
the first power that we have collected. I guess

431
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:12,550
the interesting thing happens now. When we have

432
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:18,600
the T squared, a term that is proportional to this

433
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,710
final integral X squared plus one squared. So this

434
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,980
is even if the goal is not varnishing, it's not

435
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:33,040
just a antiderivative. And what we can do here is,

436
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:39,730
again, go through integration by parts. Really, we

437
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:44,350
said that function. You want to be the X squared

438
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:50,260
and then give. Is everything else you'd be next or

439
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:57,440
even next? Plus one squared the X. Which, as we

440
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,900
have seen, is that VSL is the negative ferry

441
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,840
function. I just want everything to be X plus one

442
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,950
and. Just.

443
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:17,560
As before, we will get. The.

444
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:25,010
Very out. It is actually convenient here to note

445
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,980
that because this is an even function, I forgot to

446
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,520
drive that argument to its conclusion. We can

447
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,110
change the meaning of integration to be zero to

448
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:41,860
infinity with just a factor of two. For each side.

449
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:50,700
Of. That symmetric debate of integration and now

450
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:56,520
putting in. You times V, you get minus two X

451
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:02,710
squared. X plus one evaluated at zero and infinity,

452
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,750
and then the subtraction cancels out the negative

453
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:13,500
sign you have twice the integral of. View, which

454
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,660
is to ex again over either the ex plus one.

455
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:31,010
Now, just as you saw in our first integration by

456
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,580
parts, just when it's convenient to change the

457
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,810
standard of integration, we have the fabric

458
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:41,300
function times SULABH something proportional to

459
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:47,630
the energy and that energy is zero zero, sort of

460
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,440
the numerator of the energy goes to infinity. We

461
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,910
get zero from the infinitely large factor in the

462
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:01,040
denominator. We are again left with no so-called

463
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:07,340
boundry term and just the integration over. X

464
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,310
divided by X plus one, which is an integral we

465
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:19,180
have seen before. Let me see if I can track it

466
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:23,890
down in a reasonably short amount of time.

467
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:34,890
When we were looking at the ultra relativistic gas

468
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:41,370
of neutrinos, you had a couple of particles of

469
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:45,870
this form, axis of power divided by the X plus one,

470
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:52,740
the X. And we saw a general expression for. Those

471
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,090
integrals in terms of numerical factors, gamma

472
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:02,660
functions and Zeta functions going power lower. So

473
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,270
rather than dwelling on the

474
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:13,070
experience of the ex, we have to go over to X

475
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,670
times, even the X, so there's no overall factor of

476
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:21,710
four that we have already. There is that one minus

477
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:27,160
one over to the one power. Now the pre factor and

478
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:31,940
then you a function of two and Z the function of

479
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:32,570
two.

480
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:38,310
Get a function of two is one factorial, which is

481
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:44,400
one four times a half is two and three one zero

482
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:48,060
function with only the two to pick it up or I'll

483
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:53,400
just tell you, it is over six. So the result of

484
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,700
this integral is high speed over three and. One,

485
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,280
the is in to her expression.

486
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,540
The average price number, the first thing to go

487
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,340
was just one second. Zero zero third integral is

488
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:18,650
high school level three, which we collect gives us

489
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,330
this expression. Is that cost factor that depends

490
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,810
on you to the three halves. And then PI squared

491
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,870
over three times, four times the temperature

492
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:34,070
squared divided by the square root of the chemical

493
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:41,820
potential. So in restoring this constant vector.

494
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:50,360
In the density of states. We have. To. Times

495
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,130
Square two is the three of two or three times

496
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,450
higher than the previous path, potentially again

497
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,970
divided by three per square each barbequed, which

498
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,450
is exactly what we found in the limit of zero

499
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,120
temperature with the step function approximation

500
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:12,410
for the very function. And we now have the leading

501
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,840
correction to that, which depends quite

502
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:20,070
dramatically on the temperature and has a one over

503
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,710
square root chemical potential term similar to

504
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,810
that with similar factors of the mass of the three

505
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,940
power plants constant, chilled by squares, cancel

506
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,030
out with that rebound, say the function of two.

507
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,780
This actually becomes even more interesting if we

508
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:45,340
express it in terms of the family energy, a way to

509
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,550
wrap up the average part of the of convenience for

510
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:56,170
what we saw already with the density of states. So

511
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:01,050
kicking the three has power of both sides of this

512
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:06,790
equation gives us a huge. Over

513
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:12,790
two into the three handles China threatens to lead

514
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:19,510
to. Q And then the terms in parentheses are

515
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:24,730
reasonably linear power, there's a three PI

516
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,270
squared.

517
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,470
An average particle, no, in the factor of the

518
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:38,740
volume. Which we can. Recognize, I've written this

519
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:44,290
here, that volume times routes to include is the

520
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:49,450
numerator of zero. That's pi squared cubed shows

521
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:54,580
up with nominator. So if I replace. Everything but

522
00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:03,370
the three have end with. This G zero relation

523
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:08,190
between. The cost factor and the density of states

524
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:12,840
and the energy. To the three power.

525
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:20,400
Which plugging things in to this equation here. V0.

526
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:29,170
Equals three and the two, if you're one of the

527
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:33,420
three, Halsy. Three halves and two thirds cancel

528
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:33,840
out.

529
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:42,230
And we end up with just and three times this ratio

530
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:48,900
of view over here to the three haves. And if

531
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,160
something similar happens in the second term. G

532
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:58,620
zero is three, pi squared, T three has divided by

533
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,770
12 is three eighths

534
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:08,190
or sorry, one of the three Kansas 12 the four

535
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:12,690
which is double to eight. So there is again that

536
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:17,940
be a factor of average particle number PI squared

537
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:23,860
T squared over eight. Times that energy, the three

538
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,120
haves just as the previous term, and then the

539
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:33,370
square root of chemical potential. And what is?

540
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,220
Fun about writing things in this way is that we

541
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,700
now have. With the average particle number wrapped

542
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,950
up in the Fairbury function. The explicit

543
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:48,790
dependence on the average particle, no cancels out

544
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:54,250
and we can rearrange to isolate this ratio of

545
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:58,160
chemical potential in terms of units of the Fermi

546
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,690
energy.

547
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,890
Which of the left hand side we have, the one that

548
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,900
we can subtract from that square to square over.

549
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,490
It's very interesting to the three house, to the

550
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:20,840
square root, and then raise everything to the two

551
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,790
thirds power to pick out just that ratio. So that

552
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:29,570
is what is written below. We have successfully

553
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:36,640
reproduced. Target. And again, considering low

554
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,350
temperatures and neglecting the order key to the

555
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:47,630
fourth terms. We can just expand this Powerball.

556
00:41:54,770 --> 00:42:00,020
As one minus two thirds times, this factors that

557
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:04,280
two or three to six that date back up to 12, and

558
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,940
because the second term is already small, we will

559
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:12,530
introduce a small error from setting the ferry

560
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,020
energy to be the chemical potential, which is

561
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:20,880
which is at zero temperatures. The error in this

562
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,550
identification is coming in at order of

563
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,830
temperature squared and is part of a term that is

564
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,530
under the order temperature squared. So overall,

565
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,940
that is accurate up to terms for neglecting the

566
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,370
fourth power in the temperature relative to the

567
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:42,960
family function. And that that combines those

568
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,130
three has one power into an overall function

569
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:51,900
squared. And we end up with this equation is known

570
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:57,400
as a consistency condition. That comes from the

571
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,450
average particle, but doesn't explicitly depend on

572
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:05,600
that, apart from, as it appears, within the fairly

573
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:11,920
energy. I see that the free energy approaches the

574
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,800
chemical potential as the temperature goes to zero,

575
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,650
and then we've derived a living correction, which

576
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:21,530
is indeed negative, decreasing the chemical

577
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:26,020
potential, which is exactly what we claimed at the

578
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:31,460
start of the supplement. So this is one of those

579
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:37,480
claims justified and. And check to see if there

580
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:42,010
are questions about the Sommerfeld expansion that

581
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:46,390
we have now gone through to meeting order to get

582
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,640
this result.

583
00:43:54,670 --> 00:44:00,820
So looking at the time, we have to. Final pieces

584
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:05,500
in this little supplemental. We can get through

585
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,870
one of those documents, remember this morning,

586
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:13,420
circle back to the other one in the afternoon. We

587
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:17,350
need a tutorial. This is a supplement anyway, so

588
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,860
no harm then shifting just the last couple of

589
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:26,140
paragraphs to the tutorial. You can go much more

590
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,430
quickly through the computation of the average

591
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:38,030
internal energy. Which, as we have seen is. Set up

592
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:40,220
almost the same as the average particle, no, just

593
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:44,390
brings an additional factor of energy. So overall

594
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:48,530
power of energy to the three haves. Rather than

595
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:52,610
energy to the one has to be integrated, so the

596
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:57,200
only difference in integrated parts is that we end

597
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,980
up with that function is now two fifths of the

598
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:08,080
five halves, two thirds of the three halves. So

599
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:13,310
change in the numerical factor and the function of

600
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,830
energy that we are going to be putting through our

601
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,580
expansion, having reformulated things. In the

602
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:29,110
sharp explosion around. Equal to you, the Taylor

603
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:31,780
expansion itself is almost the same. You just pick

604
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:35,740
up different numeric factors for taking the

605
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:40,270
derivative into the five halves. We also have

606
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,630
different powers of view that appear in these

607
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:46,910
first three terms. So five has three 1/2 and

608
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:50,290
positive one half rather than the three halves and

609
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:54,910
plus or minus half that came from the previous

610
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:02,630
magic number. And plugging all of this in, we find

611
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:07,050
that we have to deal with the same integrals which

612
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:12,250
we found to be one zero and PI squared over three.

613
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,650
So at the end we have the average internal energy

614
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,330
give it in terms of the chemical potential as we

615
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,200
use the five halves, plus a correction that is

616
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,060
again, quadratic in the temperature and now

617
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:33,270
depends on the square root of new.

618
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:40,360
And just as we did at the top of this page, we

619
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,540
want to get things in terms

620
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:53,560
of the very energy which we will see provide some

621
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:01,890
elegant results. So this due to the five have

622
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,420
power coming from

623
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:10,550
our results for the approval number. We have to

624
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:14,140
move the very energy to the right hand side, and

625
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:17,440
this is approximately be energy to the five gas

626
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:22,780
power times the factor, one minus 30 squared over

627
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:28,880
12 if. Also raised to the five house power.

628
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,490
And similarly expanding.

629
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:49,120
This. Small deviation from one is one minus that

630
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:54,010
five has power of that function, we have the the

631
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:58,820
five halves times one. And then minus five hands,

632
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:04,010
so that gives us five twenty four times PI squared,

633
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,730
T squared and then A.

634
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:11,670
Lingering factor of.

635
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:20,650
So this thing is here that is squared. So even the

636
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:23,800
five haves divided by each of the four has

637
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:29,600
lipshitz that square root of the Fermi Energy. And

638
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:35,160
plugging this in for that view, the five helps

639
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:39,660
power in the average internal energy to free

640
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:46,040
energy leaves us. With that first term. Three

641
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,670
fifths.

642
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:50,450
No times.

643
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,800
If to the five heads of the three hats is a single

644
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:01,410
factor of energy sucking in the second term here

645
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:07,010
into the first term. And the expression for the

646
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:12,380
control energy, we have three fifths times five

647
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,490
twenty fourth leaves us with one eight times

648
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:18,920
cancel and twenty four with three states. We have

649
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,180
another factor of average particle number PI

650
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:27,600
squared and then T squared. And then.

651
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,400
E two, the one half divided by E to the three

652
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,630
hands is a factor of one over the ferry energy.

653
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:44,150
And then finally the second term here we can, as

654
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,060
we did before, to collect the order T-square

655
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:49,610
correction in the order to use the term dropping

656
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:54,530
that order, the fourth correction. So this is a

657
00:49:54,530 --> 00:50:00,740
plus three Ade's. Average particle, no. PI squared,

658
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:06,510
T squared and now E to the one half over each of

659
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:10,090
the three has again. Very interesting in the

660
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:10,900
denominator.

661
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:16,090
In other words, we have the.

662
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:25,610
The factor that we derived earlier this week was

663
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:29,480
internal energy had zero temperature is I consider

664
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,520
proportional to the particle number with that

665
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:37,040
factor of three fifths that we saw. And then three,

666
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:42,280
it's minus one is two aides or a quarter of PI

667
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:46,200
squared. Oftentimes, that is part of the number

668
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,480
and a factor that is quadratic in the temperature,

669
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,290
which gives us if we take the derivative with

670
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:59,010
respect to temperature, we have the linear term in

671
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:04,120
temperature left over. And that's. Quarter becomes

672
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,730
a half, and I have this sign there, which is

673
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,190
positive, three eighths minus one. It was positive

674
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:14,690
the quarter and we have a non-trivial, huge

675
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:22,660
capacity for the gas at low temperature that is

676
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:28,490
linear in temperature with a no MPRI factor factor

677
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:31,990
that we have now derived. You can't compare with

678
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:35,140
experimental data, which is some people say for

679
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:39,660
this afternoon. So. Sorry to run a couple of

680
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:43,400
minutes over to reach this result, the low

681
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:46,320
temperature heat capacity for a non relativistic

682
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:52,220
of yes. Which we will see at play this afternoon,

683
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,790
looking at the same experiment they started

684
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,700
discussing in terms of STEM last week. So

685
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,990
immediate questions shouted out otherwise. We'll

686
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:07,170
see you back here in a few hours.
