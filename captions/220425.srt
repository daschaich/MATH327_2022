1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,800
All right, might as well get underway. Welcome

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,840
back to the last quarter of the term for

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,880
statistical physics.  We will cover here the final

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,430
major topic of the course, going into interacting

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,710
systems and the new phenomena that can enable. But

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:30,160
first, let's put up the usual six digit code for

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:41,270
today before I forget about that. It is six two, three two,

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,020
six zero.

9
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,940
Before diving into the new stuff, since it's been a

10
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,290
while since we have last gone through

11
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,720
statistical physics, let's do a bit of recap of

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,530
what we've seen up to now and what remains as well

13
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:12,440
as some of the. Majestical notices that. Piled up

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,740
during the spring break. So today is.

15
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,470
The 25th of April.

16
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,620
We both in there and.

17
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,260
Terms of some just legal matters, the.

18
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,760
First homework assignment was. Returnability in

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,120
the last week or two, you mentioned that there was,

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,070
again, like the first part of the computer project,

21
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,980
a fairly broad distribution of marks. The average

22
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,800
was around sixty eight percent, with the standard

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,390
deviation around 16 percent. And that's roughly

24
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,120
what I was aiming for by making that number more

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,410
challenging than, say, the exam would be. So don't

26
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,040
be discouraged if you. I ended up with a

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,610
percentage that seems low on the face value, since

28
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,390
there is that average and standard deviation to

29
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,370
take into account the. Next step, though, is the

30
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,840
final homework that also appeared last week and is

31
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,880
due next week, so Thursday, the 5th of May go 10

32
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,010
days is going out to that. And normally it might

33
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,090
take a look at that in the tutorial on Friday,

34
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,380
since there was no tutorial last Friday. We can

35
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,820
just skim through the questions quickly here, make

36
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,490
sure they all clear and see if there are any

37
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,290
immediate questions about them. And just to get

38
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,980
underway with that, the first question we have is

39
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,370
actually picking up from one of the tutorials

40
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,390
before the spring break in at the last one. But a

41
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,870
couple of weeks before looking when we looked at.

42
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,200
Idealized sort of Namik cycles, describing

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,070
internal combustion engines, in particular

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,740
comparing the auto cycle for a petrol engine to

45
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,320
this diesel cycle, the diesel engine in question

46
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,010
is one that came up in that tutorial but was not

47
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,430
answered. Your chance to answer yourself. What is

48
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,700
the efficiency of this diesel cycle and how does

49
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,090
that compare to the efficiency of the auto cycle

50
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,810
for a internal combustion engine?

51
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,730
Second question also is not too dissimilar to the.

52
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,620
The mixing entropy that we looked at in another of

53
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,900
the tutorials here, instead of looking at what

54
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,900
happens upon mixing two distinct gases. And what

55
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,210
you just consider the mixture from the outset with

56
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,600
the new ingredient, that the gases now have

57
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,600
different properties beyond their cover that can

58
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,220
be distinguished by their wavelength. Which leads

59
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,550
to some interesting relations that could arise

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,410
among the standard observables that we impute for

61
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:29,370
an ideal gas's of the sort compared to. The two

62
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,190
separate gases of each of those particles

63
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,870
individually, if the other species were absent.

64
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,210
Quickly running through the third of four problems

65
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,850
here, dealing with the economic ensemble,

66
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,260
particularly the sagacity and expansion that. Came

67
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,820
up in the lectures relating that grant model

68
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,530
competition functioned to an infinite series of

69
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,160
economic competition functions. And deriving some

70
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,970
relations between observables or the Grand Canal,

71
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,330
it's not over, the number fluctuate and

72
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,230
derivatives of the Grand Canal, the potential of

73
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,620
the Landauer free energy with respect to that from

74
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:26,180
gas, it just may be a good opportunity to

75
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,670
highlight the point of this final relation that we

76
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:37,310
will be able to derive in this way, where if we

77
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,480
look at the relative fluctuations in that average

78
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,450
particle number compared to the total number of

79
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,780
particles, much like we saw in the case of

80
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,770
diffusion in the first year, we're back in

81
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,360
February, those relative fluctuations vanish as

82
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,360
the number of particles increases. In this case,

83
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,940
the average particle number going to infinity,

84
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,270
something called the thermodynamic limit. That has

85
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,760
come up briefly in the lecture notes and will come

86
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,160
up again this week. So what this means is that

87
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,480
when an average particle is large, the relative

88
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,440
fluctuations about it are vanishingly small and it

89
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,260
can be approximated as simply the constant

90
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,890
particle number, which is the distinction between

91
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,680
the grand, canonical and canonical examples. In

92
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,490
other words, the pragmatical ensemble system

93
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,940
described by the Great American ensemble

94
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,960
effectively reduces to economical system with a

95
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,030
fixed number of particles, one that picks up the

96
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,010
particles. It's large. So that is a worthwhile

97
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:56,000
relation to drive this case for maximum the and

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,890
then the final question focuses on the

99
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:06,140
magnetization, which we will introduce possibly

100
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,990
today. More likely tomorrow will get for the.

101
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,670
Later in the week here, we're still looking at not

102
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,770
interacting system of spitters.

103
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,090
So not reading him the bulk of the new information

104
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,460
that's coming up this week with interactive

105
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,180
systems, but with the wrinkle that each of these

106
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,490
degrees of freedom as a value continuously in the

107
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,730
range of minus one to one, rather than just taking

108
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,930
those two extreme values, that's a difference

109
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,590
compared to the knowledge and expense systems that

110
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,950
we consider all the way back in units two and

111
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:54,500
three. And the focus of this question is, Danto,

112
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,640
given the set, compute the economic competition,

113
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,030
function magnetization and look at the limits of

114
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,230
how that behaves at high and low temperatures for

115
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,370
a fixed externalising field strength gauge.

116
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:15,380
So that's just a quick look through that final

117
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,800
assignment due next week at the immediate points

118
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,290
of confusion or concern about it.

119
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,900
And that here know there is time for those to come

120
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,850
up if they occur to you later on and move on to

121
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:45,310
the next. Logistical matters still, which is that

122
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:50,390
final exam, the schedule for those was released

123
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,240
and for this module, it is a one hour personal

124
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,530
exam scheduled for Wednesday afternoon at two

125
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:04,090
thirty p.m. on the 1st of June. So toward the end

126
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,190
of the assessment period and being held in the

127
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,940
sports center, which came as a surprise to me

128
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,780
because there were. Rooms for exams in that sports

129
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,930
center. I'll try to track down the specific

130
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,930
location so I can be sure to find it about leave

131
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:32,320
you. Even on your own on that first of June? And

132
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,040
to provide some more resources for that exam

133
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,270
preparation on the Canada site for the module,

134
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,180
I've uploaded a couple of sample exams and also

135
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,540
linked to the past exams repository, which is

136
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:53,080
fairly modest for this module on 20 20 was the

137
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,160
very first time this module ran. And this that

138
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,620
makes this year the very first time it was not

139
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,660
disrupted by at least so far, so that 20 20 exam

140
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,850
is in the repository. Twenty twenty one was an

141
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,090
unusual year in terms of exams and assessments. As

142
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,210
you know, that is the final exam for twenty twenty

143
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,170
one is going to be two samples that are uploaded

144
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:27,020
to the bottom of this page on campus where right

145
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:32,000
now it's just the sets of problems for you to look

146
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,550
at and consider and get a feeling for the scale

147
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,420
and style of the exam. And at some point today,

148
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,340
I'll upload modules, moral solutions to accompany

149
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,750
these postings. Which we can probably discuss

150
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,740
before the end of. The teaching at. Weeks going

151
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,330
forward.

152
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,130
So.

153
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:08,870
That those are the main logistic issues for today,

154
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,990
though maybe I can start to.

155
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,310
Look ahead to what is coming up and mentioned that

156
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,950
compared to twenty twenty the first year, we had a

157
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,360
ordinary run of this module, we are now two hours

158
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,320
ahead in terms of covering this year, which gives

159
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,960
opportunities for. A few more supplements to be

160
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,450
added, possibly on things like booze. It's a

161
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,900
conversation little Gaspé transitions or spin

162
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,310
classes that receive to be recognized by the Nobel

163
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,390
Prize last year. So as we go forward over the next

164
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,500
few weeks, there will be less of a gap between the

165
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,570
release of the lecture notes and lectures

166
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,170
themselves as I try to figure out what topics will

167
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,960
fit nicely in terms of time and theme. With what

168
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,000
we are going over and the time that remains, which

169
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,250
I guess brings us to. The recap of where we have

170
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,490
been and the foundation that will now be building

171
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,560
on. And it's worth probably. Briefly going back

172
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,500
all the way to. Beginning.

173
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:34,530
Laila. The foundation of probability theory in

174
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,430
terms of probability spaces that consider

175
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,300
measurements performed on experiments that are

176
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,550
then defining outcomes, sets of those all possible

177
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,520
outcomes of these experiments that are then assign

178
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,190
probabilities and the particular realization of

179
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:03,210
statistical samples as the probability spaces that

180
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,990
correspond to a collection of particles that are

181
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,620
evolving in time and probabilistically adopting

182
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,530
different possible microstates as they as time

183
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:21,570
goes on and these particles are left free to do

184
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,130
their thing.

185
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,570
And we have looked at. Three distinct statistical

186
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,430
examples, so.

187
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,140
Rather than writing anything here, might as well

188
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,860
zoom out to. The big picture contrasting these

189
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,420
three statistical samples of the memorable way to

190
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,630
keep track of how they differ, both in terms of

191
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,380
the constraints that are imposed in each of these

192
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,730
samples and what those constraints mean in

193
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,910
practice.

194
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,790
So in the microeconomic ensemble, we directly

195
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,690
apply the conservation of energy, as well as the

196
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,770
conservation of the number of degrees of freedom,

197
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,340
particleboard, which means that we are considering

198
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,060
a system that is completely isolated from the rest

199
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,210
of the universe. There's no way for any particles

200
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,120
to be exchanged within the system or no way for

201
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,430
energy to flow into or out of the system. Whereas

202
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,670
with the Canaletto ensemble, that's more

203
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,040
realistically matches out of the sorts of

204
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,360
experiments that you've done.

205
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:45,600
In. Physics and. Science, more broadly, we still

206
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,750
preserve the number of particles and allow those

207
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,130
to freely come and go, but we do allow energy to

208
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,720
be exchanged between the system and its

209
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,330
surroundings so that we can do things like look at

210
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:02,090
it and measure it and manipulate it. And we set up

211
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,690
in place of that constraint on the energy. The

212
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,110
temperature is now in quantity fixed and the

213
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,240
economical framework by.

214
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,380
Demanding that the system we're interested in is

215
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,610
in thermal contact with the large external keypad

216
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,520
for thermal reservoir with which energy can freely

217
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,530
be exchanged. And that is large enough to fix the

218
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,820
overall temperature of the system, went through a

219
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,330
couple to the heat and the canonical ensemble

220
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,660
takes this to the logical conclusion, along with

221
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,690
particle number and energy, to fluctuate with the

222
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,150
large external reservoir. Now, being a particle

223
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:53,140
reservoir with which the system can exchange both

224
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,270
particles and energy. Now, keep it fixed, in

225
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,790
addition to the temperature, the chemical

226
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:05,720
potential that. Effectively describes the flow of

227
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,860
these particles from the high density to really

228
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,810
secluded city.

229
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,430
So.

230
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,740
Over the weeks, we have not only. Defiant,

231
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:40,040
introduced. Those micro, canonical, canonical

232
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:46,460
examples, but in all three cases. We have imposed

233
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,710
thermodynamic equilibrium.

234
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,500
By maximizing the entropy of the system, they see

235
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:08,250
that back in writing is at least plausibly legible.

236
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,110
Maximizing the entropy of these systems, being

237
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,370
consistent with the second law of thermodynamics,

238
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,350
that the entropy is not decreasing, pollution

239
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,420
increasing

240
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,280
led us to be economical. The graphic novel, the

241
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,580
case, the precision function.

242
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:36,210
And the corresponding free energy or potential as

243
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:42,690
the fundamental starting points for analysis of

244
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,580
systems governed by the use of probability spaces,

245
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,750
and we've seen particular examples of applications

246
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:58,020
of the canonical ensemble to the classical ideal

247
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,800
gaseous.

248
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,660
Of the swords appearing in question two of the

249
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,480
biggest homework assignments as well as.

250
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,990
Thermodynamic cycles.

251
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:19,800
So the question, what addresses and the canonical

252
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,340
case?

253
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,450
The corresponding quantum ideal gas is.

254
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,790
Where you have two types of quantum particles goes

255
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:37,670
up to four each with their own distinct behavior.

256
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:43,010
So we have gone through quite a bit so far, but

257
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,340
all of it has been considering systems of

258
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,220
particles or degrees of freedom that don't

259
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,580
interact with each other. As always, precise

260
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,990
mathematical way we get into today and tomorrow

261
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,040
defining what it means for particles to be

262
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,810
interacting or not attracting. And as we introduce

263
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:10,920
interactions. And you will find that systems

264
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:16,800
become more complicated, but also allow a broader

265
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,800
range of more realistic behaviors to be modeled,

266
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,270
and we will do so building on all of these.

267
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,480
Concepts, tools and techniques that we derived

268
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,010
prior to the spring break, and as I understand,

269
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,970
this is a extended introduction to getting back

270
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,540
into the course of stuff like one less thing that

271
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,850
as we went through. All of the topics so far, if

272
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,950
any of those sounded unfamiliar and you had a hard

273
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,920
time recalling what the point was, what the

274
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,290
details were, I set up a way for you to flag those

275
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,750
you can do anonymously, just filling in a response

276
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,490
to these polls everywhere, activities that I'll

277
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,150
leave potentially and definitely see if there are

278
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,810
asynchronous concerns. Outside of class meetings

279
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,890
that can then be addressed as we go forward, for

280
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,760
instance, in tutorials, so I will continue to say,

281
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,220
are there? Any questions in the media, questions

282
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,080
about the roadmap that is taking us to the point

283
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,070
that we are now?

284
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,830
Typically, there are not, and that poll everywhere

285
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,800
provides a way for any questions that do come up

286
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,880
at any time to be symptoms, to be quickly and

287
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,900
easily, rather than putting you on the spot here

288
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,230
in that.

289
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,520
So the.

290
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,650
Zoo is adequate to move on to those long term

291
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,320
message systems. Where?

292
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,860
There's even a bit more here about the recap in.

293
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,740
Looking at some of the specific physical systems

294
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,970
that we found were very well modeled by not

295
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,870
interacting systems in the last tutorial before

296
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,230
the spring break, we put that. The heat capacity

297
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,560
is accelerating, so fantastic agreement between

298
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,430
our calculations coming from the well, coming from

299
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:49,890
the Dubai theory of Soldz, but also totals to

300
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,940
those capacities, as well as the blank spectrum

301
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,690
for solar radiation and the cosmic microwave

302
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,640
background. There are. So those are examples,

303
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,250
we're not interacting systems. And tell us a great

304
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,880
deal about what is going on in physics, but there

305
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,530
is, of course, much more that can go on and cannot

306
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:22,980
be captured by these monitoring systems. And just

307
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,820
as a bit of general motivation, you talk a bit

308
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:32,560
about phase transitions. As. Phenomena that

309
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,320
typically are not captured by not the tracking

310
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,330
systems, the biggest transitions, as you probably

311
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,960
appreciate, occur in a very wide range of

312
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,100
circumstances, but every day and extreme and are

313
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,400
exactly the type of physical phenomenon that we

314
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,500
want to mathematically analyze and describe using

315
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,820
statistical physics.

316
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,100
What they amount to is when we take the same

317
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:07,610
system, the same set of stuff, and depending on

318
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,040
the control parameters, the conditions in which

319
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,100
the system exists, it's temperature pressure, the

320
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,210
overall large scale system exhibits vastly

321
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:21,470
different behaviors. So in an everyday situation,

322
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,370
we can think about boiling the kettle to force

323
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,070
liquid water, to transition to steam. Both

324
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,920
collections of EU molecules behaving in a

325
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:37,010
qualitatively different ways, as well as actually

326
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,340
freezing liquid water through solid ice is another

327
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,330
phase transition of this sort. Maybe more exotic

328
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,840
example that. Maybe less familiar, but some of you

329
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,960
might have heard of the courtroom on plasma,

330
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,470
that's. Is the phase in which the matter in the

331
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,010
universe existed for the first few microseconds

332
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,710
following the Big Bang until the universe crumbled

333
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:10,290
enough for these quarks gluons to transition into

334
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:13,760
the protons and neutrons, particles that we had

335
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,600
and everything else are made out of today.

336
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,930
Maybe to split the difference between that every

337
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:32,340
day and extreme. A flag. An interesting. He's a

338
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,510
particularly interesting phase transition that

339
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:38,230
occurs in type of materials, not the type of stuff

340
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,890
that we work with every day, are things that can

341
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,340
easily be produced and played with in a physics

342
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:51,070
lab. That are based on graphic and get something.

343
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:56,690
Exotic, but in the news, so it's a remarkable

344
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:01,860
material that consists of. A single atom thick

345
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:06,960
sheet of carbon atoms that are made in the form of

346
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,400
a hexagonal or honeycomb structure. You get an

347
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,230
idea of what that is. This picture out here shows

348
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:22,510
two large hexagons or honeycomb cells. Overlap on

349
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:27,340
top of each other in such a way that the smaller

350
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,420
unit hexagons that they're built out of overlap

351
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,130
into.

352
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:40,500
Certain numbers of cells zoom in a bit here, you

353
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,360
can see there are that's maximum zoom or hexagons

354
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,150
within hexagons in the system of two layers of the

355
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,270
single atom, thick graphene placed on top of each

356
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:59,820
other and motion very slightly by the small angle

357
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:05,600
theta that is around. One degree, but one degree,

358
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,190
I think, is the. Next degree with the next

359
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,910
significant figure in that theater, what was

360
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,610
discovered just a few years ago was that in this

361
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:22,210
situation where two layers of graphene are stacked

362
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,130
in twisted by just that small amount. The overall,

363
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,130
while their system transitions from the normal

364
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,670
electrical insulator phase, the Graffin exists

365
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,810
where it's sort of like wood, it doesn't really

366
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,030
allow electrical parents to flow naturally turns

367
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:46,830
into an electrical superconductor where electrical

368
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,890
currents are able to flow without encountering any

369
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,400
resistance, which is to say without producing any

370
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,650
heat from the air flow and as a consequence,

371
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,090
without using any energy to the production of

372
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:09,220
wasted. So superconductivity is. A remarkable

373
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,970
phase of conducting materials discovered a little

374
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:18,870
over a century ago. That's. For reasons I.

375
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:23,010
Although we're talking about generally only occurs

376
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,610
at very low temperatures in this case of twisted

377
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,310
by their grapheme, the temperature below two

378
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:34,500
Heldon, so about minus three hundred degrees

379
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:40,430
Celsius. Now, numbers. And for decades now,

380
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:45,900
there's been a worldwide push to. Find these sorts

381
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,640
of novel materials that exhibit superconductivity

382
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,480
at higher temperatures, ideally room temperatures

383
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,180
that don't require a great degree of cooling,

384
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,500
which would allow if such materials could be

385
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,710
discovered or design and we were able to build

386
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:09,360
electronics or power networks out of it. You can

387
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,840
no longer lose large amounts of energy to the

388
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,050
production of waste, to the energy efficiency of

389
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,340
all technology would increase dramatically.

390
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,490
Superconductivity that can also mentioned is a key

391
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,910
feature of a lot of quantum devices that are

392
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,300
employed in quantum computing precisely because

393
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,780
none of this waste is produced, that leads to the

394
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,990
delicate quantum superposition. Being destroyed in

395
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,310
those quantum computers, so the irrelevant phase

396
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:52,230
transition in this situation. Is that from an

397
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,330
electrical insulator to a superconductor allowing

398
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,060
electrical current either not to flow or to flow

399
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:04,430
without resistance? And this example of the phase

400
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:08,180
transition along with those others, like water and

401
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,830
plasma discussed, have to do with the interactions

402
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,640
between the degrees of freedom in the system.

403
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,570
It is, in fact, the. The way in which the two

404
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:31,600
sheets of hexagonal lettuces align to form larger

405
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,670
hexagons that allow more powerful interactions to

406
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,480
be introduced into these systems between that

407
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,560
stupid phase transition. That's a bit of a

408
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:50,440
digression into physics that isn't really relevant

409
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,440
for what we're going to be doing here now. And of

410
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,370
course, I just couldn't resist chatting up some of

411
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,460
that fun stuff. This is all motivation for

412
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,770
investigating phase transitions. And as usual, we

413
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,910
will introduce this sort of thing by going back to

414
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:16,870
our simplest physical system, one of these systems

415
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,830
that we have already considered. Back when they

416
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,890
were not interacting to introduce things like

417
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:28,110
entropy and temperature, the canonical example. So

418
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,050
as a more detailed recap and reminder of that

419
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:37,030
particular system in the not interacting case. The

420
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:41,570
internal energy for a given microstates labor

421
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:46,000
supply that is determined by the orientation of

422
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:52,450
some fixed number of spins. Is just the product of

423
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,610
each of those orientations with an external

424
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,470
magnetic field.

425
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,360
Strength parametrized with this constant variable

426
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:10,830
pitch that we always take to be positive. And the.

427
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,940
The end here represents the orientation of the

428
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,620
spin of the little and spin, how to be big and

429
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:26,100
total that takes only one of two possible balance

430
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:30,520
of the spin is a line parallel to that magnetic

431
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,630
field. Then this estimate equals one and the

432
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,670
energy gets a contribution of negative each

433
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:42,340
lowering it. If the spin is a. parallel to the

434
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,960
field, then it is to give you the minus one and

435
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,950
the energy gets a positive contribution plus age.

436
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,280
So we saw back in June three that the ground state

437
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,140
of the system, the macro state with minimal energy,

438
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,740
is the one in which all of the spins are aligned

439
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,380
parallel to the field. So there the sun is just

440
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:10,090
the sun over and factors of one. And the total

441
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,350
energy of that ground state is the negative of the

442
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,530
total number of spins times the external magnetic

443
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:17,920
field.

444
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,300
So we use this, the tracking system as a

445
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,930
playground to explore the physics of information

446
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,290
in the way that the entropy and internal energy

447
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:37,570
differ with the temperature, depending on whether

448
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,640
or not the spins were distinguishable or

449
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,030
indistinguishable. At least for this unit, the

450
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:47,290
focus only on the distinguishable case where all

451
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:52,390
of these spins are embedded in a fixed lattice. In

452
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,730
particular, we'll consider just simple cubic

453
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:59,700
lattices, at least from. Said the lectures, there

454
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,460
are other lattice structures that will be

455
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,940
interesting to discuss in the tutorial, and we

456
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,610
also go beyond the earlier work by allowing these

457
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:16,900
lattices to be multi-dimensional. So back in two

458
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,850
and three, the latter be considered in this

459
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:27,150
external field of speech, just some number of

460
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:33,510
spins of the line, either up or down the line or

461
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:38,070
into alignment with the magnetic field where the

462
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,860
position of each spin in this one dimensional

463
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,490
lattice.

464
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,050
System of spin is arranged line.

465
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,340
Just allows us to leave Alaska and say, guess what

466
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,160
we did off there in this particular microstates

467
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,510
that I've drawn here, it's been Escalon has you

468
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:06,030
plus one mile spense estate has value minus one.

469
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:13,030
And it's not too hard to repeat this same sort of.

470
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,120
Visualization for. A two dimensional scan system

471
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:25,350
gets progressively harder as we consider higher

472
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:31,640
and higher dimensions. There again, with that same.

473
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,550
Fix external Magnetic Fields Beach, we have a two

474
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:42,530
dimensional array of spins, a line either parallel

475
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:47,600
to the magnetic field. So the first state and the

476
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,650
fourth row, this micro state has the value of plus

477
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:58,760
one. The fourth spin in the first row has a value

478
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:03,290
minus one aligned against that magnetic field and.

479
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:12,380
While we will focus on. That is one or two or

480
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,880
three dimensions spins arranged in a line, on a

481
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,010
sheet or in a volume, mathematically, the

482
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,420
construction of used spin systems works just as

483
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:32,360
well for any integer, no dimensions, one or above.

484
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:36,930
And it will be. We will see you useful context in

485
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,090
which thinking of abstract mathematical.

486
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,330
Systems in higher numbers, interventions of the

487
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,920
three that we operate in will be useful to gain

488
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,030
insight into the calculations and determining.

489
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,830
And so, Tim.

490
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:05,940
Define that more vigorously, more mathematically,

491
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,010
what we mean when we say that these systems are

492
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:15,320
not interacting, we can. No, first, that the

493
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,940
overall internal energy or the systems we consider

494
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:24,350
so far factories into a simple sum of

495
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:28,100
contributions, so individual energies for each

496
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:32,920
individual degree of freedom in the system. And

497
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,670
this is at least an aspect of the overall

498
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,970
factorization that we have seen in our previous

499
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,070
treatment, where we saw, for instance, that

500
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:46,570
considering these storm systems, we could analyze

501
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:50,280
them by computing the single particle partition

502
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:54,460
function, in this case, a single spin that points

503
00:36:54,460 --> 00:37:00,340
either up or down and then obtaining the overall

504
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,000
importance for protection function, for instance,

505
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:08,380
in this equation, for one, just by taking that

506
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,790
product of identical independent single particle

507
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,990
partition functions to the incredible production

508
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,730
function that I could be able to see. And that's

509
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,820
just the power of that single particle partition

510
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,630
function in this case, two times the hyperbolic

511
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:29,680
cosine of that magnetic field divided by

512
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,520
temperature.

513
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,610
Now, this is an aspect of factorization,

514
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:38,840
factorization is a bit more subtle. That just

515
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,010
being able to write the overall internal energy as

516
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:47,120
a sum of contributions from different degrees of

517
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,790
freedom. There is a stronger condition that needs

518
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,400
to be satisfied in order to guarantee

519
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,500
factorization or guarantee prevalently that the

520
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:07,030
system is not interacting. Which considers what

521
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:13,330
happens to that internal energy when just one of

522
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,380
the degrees of freedom is changed. So call that

523
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,250
the degree your freedom in serving the subsequent

524
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:25,480
I, as you refer to, different microstates. And

525
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,530
suppose we make some change to this particular

526
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:35,240
degree of freedom. That's produces some change in

527
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,800
the overall energy of the system. Delta, a subject.

528
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:49,460
The system is not interacting if and only if. The

529
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,440
change in internal energy for any arbitrary degree

530
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,150
of freedom turns out to be independent of all the

531
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:03,440
other degrees of freedom. Labeled by nightfall

532
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,930
Tuesday. So part of the reason for reviewing the

533
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,680
track and speed system in so much detail here is

534
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,730
to demonstrate that this definition makes sense

535
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:21,950
and that we do indeed recover, confirm that under

536
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:26,100
this definition, the indistinguishable speeds that

537
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,430
we've been considering are, in fact.

538
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:34,720
Not attracted, so the only possible change that we

539
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,640
can make to any of these degrees of freedom is to

540
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,340
negate its value, which corresponds to slipping

541
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,940
its orientation with respect to that external

542
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,730
magnetic field. If we pick a degree of freedom

543
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,890
that happens to be split up along with the

544
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,080
magnetic field, we flip it to spin down negative

545
00:39:54,080 --> 00:40:00,250
for Angelyne and vice versa so we can consider

546
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:05,230
what happens to the internal energy. Upon.

547
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,040
Performing that sort of spiritual navigation of

548
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,910
the degree of freedom for an arbitrary still in

549
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,320
the system. So what we can do starting from that

550
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,310
internal energy.

551
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:28,250
We wrote down on the previous page is pick out

552
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:36,170
from that song over all and spins the spin that we

553
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:39,290
will be flipping. And then what remains in the

554
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:45,090
song is all those other degrees of freedom, Candy,

555
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,730
that are not equal to Jay.

556
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:56,100
So when we put that spin, that's picks up a

557
00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:02,400
negative sign and nothing else happens to the

558
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,320
other spins. We then take the difference between

559
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:11,390
the new internal energy after that speech and the

560
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:16,960
starting points that we wrote down here, can you

561
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,590
see that Delta is associated with Arbitraging? So

562
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:25,130
those sums canceling the difference in the left

563
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:30,020
with just two times, eight times the original

564
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,350
value of that spin. As subject, which has to be

565
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:41,060
the. Independent of all. The.

566
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:48,260
Other degrees of freedom that been with Kate J.

567
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,030
Which

568
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,420
checks out with.

569
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:02,150
Our claim that this is a not a tracking system by

570
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,270
the more formal definition that we now have.

571
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:12,250
So any questions about that were the build up to.

572
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,540
To this definition of what it means for the system

573
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,700
to be interacting or not.

574
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,770
Because the next step is to.

575
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:31,780
Make things a bit more interesting by changing how

576
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:37,120
the internal energy of our system depends on the

577
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,480
degrees of freedom. So really, this is a different

578
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,100
spin system where the internal energy has, in

579
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:50,500
addition to the interaction or the contributions

580
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,860
of the energy from each of these spins coupled to

581
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,760
that external with added fuel, we have a second

582
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:04,450
term, the internal energy A. Contribution to the

583
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:07,300
internal energy that depends on the product of two

584
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:12,880
spins, SMG Times, that's OK. We're the sum here.

585
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:15,870
Is being taken over.

586
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:23,150
AU pairs of nearest neighbor spins in the lattice,

587
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,460
so the Haitian being defined here is that Jaquet

588
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:34,820
in parentheses are picking out all sight, all J

589
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:39,000
and K that are next to each other in any one of

590
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,250
the. The dimensions that we are operating at, just

591
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:50,310
as a quick illustration of this, we look at a 2D

592
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,660
lattice representing the Spinosaurus points rather

593
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:59,190
than upward of Delaporte arrows. The nearest

594
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,980
neighbors of this size, circled in blue,

595
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,760
correspond to those four sites circled in red,

596
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,000
either left or right of it in one dimension or

597
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,580
above or below it in that second dimension.

598
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,790
Similarly, for all the higher dimensions that we

599
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:15,810
might consider.

600
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:24,260
So now in this case, we can. Do the same exercise,

601
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,580
computing the change in the internal energy of

602
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:31,730
flipping a student with this new expression for

603
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:35,830
the internal energy. The approach is the same with.

604
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,270
We write the internal energy, pulling out the

605
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:44,950
arbitrary spin we're going to flip so from the

606
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:52,380
first term. We can pull out of jail and there will

607
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:58,070
be some number of terms in this, some. For all the

608
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:03,290
spins that are in. The nearest neighbor cares,

609
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:08,420
Jake, for this fixed J this SJT gets multiplied by

610
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:14,030
České, and then there are all of the other two

611
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:19,340
spin combinations that don't involve our spin of

612
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,870
interest. OK, so this is a sum over nearest

613
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:28,640
neighbor pairs this little M and K that do not

614
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:35,970
contain J. That same product of spin time spin

615
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,410
came.

616
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:43,580
And then the same sort of. External magnetic field

617
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:47,320
terms that we had before, minus stage times

618
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,640
yesterday, plus some of all that are not.

619
00:45:54,710 --> 00:46:01,970
So I'm flipping the spin, S.J making the change

620
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:04,760
that I was her degree of freedom, the sign of this

621
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:12,000
first term. Flips to become positive. Back in. N

622
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:16,250
never pairs of jeans. Nothing happens to the

623
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:20,380
second term. Something over here, it appears, that

624
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,660
do not include spenger.

625
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:32,130
In the thick of a negative sign. On spenger

626
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:38,310
multiplied by the magnetic field. But not. The.

627
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:42,870
Other degrees of freedom. So taking the difference

628
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:43,260
here.

629
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:52,610
Those two terms that don't involve Jay Hawkins and

630
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,880
Delta, a subject that comes out, is to get a

631
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,310
factor of two times the spenger now multiply not

632
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:10,560
only by age, but by. There's some barricade the

633
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,600
nearest neighbor appears to have escaped. So.

634
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:25,010
Hopefully, there are no objections to that

635
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:31,430
calculation. We can see that. In contrast to the

636
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:35,210
not tracking system, this new internal energy.

637
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:43,740
Produces a. Changing energy upon changing what the

638
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,530
degrees of freedom that depend on other degrees of

639
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,100
freedom. So this Delta, Ajay.

640
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:54,940
Now depends. These this.

641
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:04,720
With Kay. Going to change. So this is. Now

642
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:10,400
contracting. System, in contrast to the simpler

643
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,140
one that we've been setting up to battle.

644
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,820
Rather than. Going on to introduce some more

645
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,300
terminology about the underlying structure of

646
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,050
these systems,

647
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,020
best to stop here by.

648
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,670
Just reiterating that we have now confirmed that

649
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:44,060
this new spin system with an internal energy that

650
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,150
depends on products of substance, in addition to

651
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,610
the product of a speed with that external magnetic

652
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,050
field, does provide us with an interacting system.

653
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,780
And after a overnight break tomorrow morning, we

654
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,240
can look forward to starting to do more

655
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:04,380
interesting things. With this simple interacting

656
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:11,050
system, so. Unless there are questions before we

657
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:16,140
break for the evening, I will forward to seeing

658
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:19,180
you back in the other room tomorrow morning at.

659
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:27,200
When?
