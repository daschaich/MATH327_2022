1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,100
Okay, I think we can get going. Welcome to the final week of the teaching

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,720
term in Statistical Physics.  With the printer again

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,490
having trouble, we'll be a bit more impromptu

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,940
than usual today.  So starting with the six-digit code

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,030
for the system: six one, seven seven,

6
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,330
zero three.

7
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,840
The plan for today is now that we're in the last

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,910
week, we can do some more fun stuff looking at so-called

9
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,670
Kramers--Wannier duality that may be the most

10
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:58,710
mathematically complex bit of calculation that

11
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,580
we do.  But before we dive into dualities, let's

12
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,230
just regroup after the weekend and recall

13
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,940
the other part of the supplemental information

14
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,450
that we've been going through, on exact solutions to

15
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,960
these simple realizations of the Ising model.  So in

16
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,320
one dimension on Friday, we exactly solved that

17
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,950
using model, just this chain of spins pointing

18
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,950
either up or down with a vicious circle, the power

19
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:49,460
to split itself with the one, and that exact

20
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,930
solution gave us some nasty closed form expression

21
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,070
for the partition function, which. We don't

22
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,010
directly care about so much except as a means to

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,220
compute observable expectation values through

24
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,110
derivatives of free energy. So first of all, the

25
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,190
reason that we were able to solve this model in

26
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:21,550
one dimension and more was thanks to. The relation

27
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,270
between the links and sites, so there were the

28
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:30,190
same number of links as there were sites, and you

29
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,300
could rearrange the some of our nearest neighbor

30
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,880
interaction terms so as to recast it into a some

31
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,230
oversight's with constraints imposed on the values

32
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,040
of the site every point it appeared in that

33
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,800
petition function. That will be resolved through.

34
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,760
Formulating the calculation in terms of the

35
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,320
transfer matrix, matrix multiplication. Imposing

36
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,360
those constraints automatically for us, those

37
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,270
constraints will be something that comes up again

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,980
today in two dimensions. Now from the results for.

39
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,720
Magnetization coming from the. Derivative of the

40
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,810
free energy with respect, the feel feel our exact

41
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:25,970
solution. That was always vanishing for any

42
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,370
temperatures, for increased temperature data. So.

43
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,230
There is no easy transition at all in the one

44
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,920
dimensional realization, the easy ball that was

45
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,000
initially studied in the 1920s, which means, first

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,990
of all, that meaningful approximation that

47
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,250
predicts a second order phase transition. At a

48
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,100
critical temperature of two in this case would be

49
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,000
a critical experience of a half. You confirmed

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,170
that this fails badly in what direction, given

51
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,590
quantitatively the right results and our earlier

52
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,750
discussion in Section two that identified the

53
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,380
order disorder phases of using model without

54
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,820
explicitly considering the dimensionality also

55
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,310
failed.

56
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,170
Because it didn't take into account.

57
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,130
The.

58
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,720
Tussler microstates for that first excited energy

59
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,090
level that could have any value of the

60
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,080
magnetization.

61
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,300
Serrations.

62
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,580
We phrase this in terms of domains of upward and

63
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,030
downward, what extends with domain walls between

64
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,370
the necrophiliac to move around the system,

65
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,160
producing microstates with any value of

66
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,410
magnetization, but the same energy.

67
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,760
Is one of the arguments that we went through more

68
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,570
quickly, probably we than first considering using

69
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,760
moral high and low temperature limits.

70
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,260
So are there any questions about. The one the

71
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,300
exact solution more. Anything that came before it,

72
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,840
before we go and see what we can do in one

73
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,590
dimension higher up in the two dimensional system.

74
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,780
Although. The two dimensional using model with.

75
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,890
Zero zero feel and the square lasts without any

76
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,850
frustration. There is an exact solution for the

77
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,650
system by Morrisson Singer of the 1940s, which is

78
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,740
sort of a superhuman feat of mathematics. That is

79
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,350
one of those things you can read through it and

80
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,240
don't really learn anything except that the

81
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,990
Vatican installations all over Dallas. But

82
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,130
historically, in fact, before about three years

83
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,450
before Einziger came up with that solution, there

84
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:29,160
was a bit of a breakthrough made by two other

85
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,780
physicists named Tom Kramers and Gregory William.

86
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,060
We're actually able to determine the exact

87
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,650
critical temperature of the two dimensional using

88
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,810
model without being able to solve it. And then

89
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,730
Ozgur subsequently proposed a solution, is able to

90
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,970
confirm and check that it did indeed reproduce

91
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,240
this critical temperature that we will be dropping

92
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,950
today, possibly wrapping up tomorrow morning. This

93
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,020
is one of the more complicated calculations that I

94
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,310
don't want to to rush through the basic idea. Just

95
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,840
to have a goal in mind as we go through this

96
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,700
supplementary subsection is that we want to show

97
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,690
that two different easy models at different but

98
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:27,940
related in temperature is better until they are

99
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,210
related with these funny looking three factors

100
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,500
that we were hoping to derive to the petition

101
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,040
function for that to the easy model that

102
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,480
temperature data is that proportional to. The

103
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,430
partition partition for the difference is the

104
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,620
model in two dimensions at a different.

105
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,450
Temperature, Tilde, and the specific relation

106
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,360
between beard and beard is held, it is given by

107
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,050
the inverse relationship between a hyperbolic

108
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:06,910
cinches of too big and too big to kill. So this is

109
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,110
this relation is now known as Kramers

110
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,430
biodegradability and is one of the earliest

111
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:21,130
examples of. This more general concept of duality,

112
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,220
not the earliest, but one of the real

113
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,790
breakthroughs in its development where duality has

114
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,960
become one of the most powerful tools in twenty

115
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,220
first century theoretical physics, perhaps most

116
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,790
famously through so-called holographic duality,

117
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,220
stimulate certain theories of quantum gravity to

118
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,260
simpler systems that resemble, in many ways the

119
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,850
physical systems we've been working with,

120
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,180
especially in this unit on track and theories. So

121
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,560
one thing to note in this equation, 120 to related

122
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,410
to temperatures of the two parties and functions,

123
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,640
is that when one of these babies is large, as

124
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,820
large, the the other must be small. So there's an

125
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,060
inverse relation between the temperature and the

126
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,290
dual temperature. The same thing holds if it is

127
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,320
small, the atmosphere must be large. And so it's

128
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,330
also for the temperature itself. So this is

129
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,630
another general feature of Dallis that. One of the

130
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,560
pairs of dual systems is that some high

131
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,160
temperature or resemble settings, a strong

132
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,400
coupling, and it gets related to a different

133
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,370
system and a low temperature or recoupling. And

134
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,090
vice versa, which allows different approximation

135
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,550
techniques to be applied in those different

136
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:01,220
regimes. So one thing we could do to the build up

137
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,180
to this overall result of going after is then

138
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,110
carry out the high and low temperature expansions

139
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,220
of the two dimensional model, much as we did for

140
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,230
knowledge and systems. And also, as we saw for

141
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,470
some of the homework problems even last week,

142
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:26,000
really, we replaced discrete spins with variables

143
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,990
and looked at the high temperature limits simplify

144
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,120
in the interests of time. Even though this is a

145
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,460
supplement, we will skip over that exercise.

146
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,900
You can find the basic methods to do it in some of

147
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,610
the the references that

148
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,900
are in the very beginning of the lecture, notes

149
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,550
David Thomas lectures on statistical physics. The

150
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,990
only downside to skipping that motivational

151
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,810
exercise is looking at the high and low

152
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,490
temperature limits of existing models. Is that

153
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:18,370
some of the tricks we will apply are motivated by

154
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,170
that and that seem to come out of thin air just

155
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,380
going through things more directly. The first of

156
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,190
those is is an example where we start off with two

157
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,810
is multiplication function that we know of

158
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,630
exponential with minus beta types. The energy

159
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,970
energy itself is that some of our own neighbor

160
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,030
repairs of the product of spins on those nearest

161
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:48,010
the sites magnetic field is set to zero and we fix

162
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,200
two dimensions. So each site has four nearest

163
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,560
neighbors in this cell. Left, right and up and

164
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:02,880
down. Now, as usual, the exponential sum is

165
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,220
converted to the product of exponential factors

166
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,630
and then

167
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,330
uniquely because the speed variables and the easy

168
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:17,020
model are always just plus or minus one another,

169
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,540
they are multiplied or not. We can rewrite the

170
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,260
exponential factor in terms of hyper trigonometric

171
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,880
functions, which is easy to check just by brute

172
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:36,750
force. If we plug in the possibility SJS K

173
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:43,330
positive one, then on one side. This identity

174
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:49,690
we've declared would have. Plus, Lustbader, and on

175
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,040
the other side, you would have a clash. He's a

176
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,660
debater plus into the minus beta, plus the cinch,

177
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,240
if the beta minus even want to speed up. Where

178
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,650
those two terms cancel and we get even better

179
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:13,470
equals to the better. And similarly, the only

180
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,300
other possible.

181
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,830
Set up where the product is negative. On the left

182
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,550
hand side, that picks up the negative one to be to

183
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,390
the negative bitter and the negative sides appear

184
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:35,000
in a slightly different place from the other

185
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,570
presence of that factor of SJT Times case. So now

186
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,720
it's the Pluspetrol terms that cancel. And we've

187
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,130
confirmed this first. Rewriting of the protection

188
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:54,450
function in terms of. Cautious and cinches of the

189
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:59,930
temperature with this factor, the nearest neighbor,

190
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,540
skin products, time to ask.

191
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,360
And. What we are going to do with that expression

192
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:15,940
is rewrite the sum of two terms as an explicit sum

193
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:23,700
over two terms. Where we will raise this product

194
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,620
spent SJS Cages of Power PJAK, so a different

195
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,280
power for every year as they prepare for the every

196
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,330
link in the labs and we will multiply that by a

197
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:39,020
baby dependent's prefecture, the capital C, with

198
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,870
that same subscripts, that power of zero one

199
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,530
responding to the side of. Times something to the

200
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,970
power. Zero is just cosmetic by itself, when see

201
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,120
when P equals one, we identify C one with the of

202
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,750
data with a escaped space. The power one.

203
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:12,050
So. We now have a product overall to add links in

204
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:17,060
this two dimensional lattice and we some over a

205
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:22,040
variable power that takes two values for each of

206
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,960
those to add links.

207
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:32,390
And if we just simplify the organization of this.

208
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,540
Is to rearrange this product of Solms into the

209
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,850
so-called configuration systems of just the same

210
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,540
sort of setup that we've been dealing with in

211
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,880
terms of the spins on the log and the partition

212
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,970
function, the microstates are defined by all

213
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,960
possible configurations of spins, happy values,

214
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,220
plus one or minus one point down. And we can

215
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,790
recognize that this combination of the product and

216
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,870
some is also accounting for all possible

217
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,680
combinations of these powers being either zero or

218
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,740
one now on the two end wings of the two

219
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,420
dimensional. That is with us.

220
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:25,320
And I will probably start talking more loosely

221
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,240
that whenever one of these powers, PJAK equals one,

222
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,120
we can say that the corresponding link between

223
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,870
sites Chain K is on and similarly, that link is

224
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,800
off when that power equals zero sum of all

225
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,190
possible configurations of. Ways of turning the

226
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:52,810
two lakes all off in the system. So that is sort

227
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,870
of the first big step toward the Kramers wanted.

228
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,100
Well, it is so clear so far what we are doing is

229
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,300
not necessarily by.

230
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,310
If there are objections coming up for that, I was

231
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:15,620
shocked about, but by recasting this product of

232
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,950
cells in terms of their configuration, so we are

233
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:25,070
left with a convenient. Products as the innermost

234
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,370
level of operations we have to do to define this

235
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,580
function, which is convenience, we can split it up

236
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,570
into the two parts, one of which depends on the

237
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,780
temperature data, but not Austins, the other of

238
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,410
which depends on spins, not on that in temperature.

239
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,550
And.

240
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:53,280
Focusing on the. Only remaining evidence of the

241
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,440
spin that isolated this to be a product of all

242
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,600
pairs of skins, nearest neighbor gators over all

243
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:08,730
the links to the LAS. So within that product, over

244
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,300
all of those legs, any given spin is going to show

245
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,330
up four times. So if that is the standard

246
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,100
deviation of these four nearest neighbors in two

247
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,780
dimensions all over each of those four legs.

248
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,380
Next

249
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,780
on this one at.

250
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:39,360
Yes.

251
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:49,430
Up. The four powers of Essive Ed raised to the

252
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,950
four different key variables to respond to

253
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,590
individually each of these four legs. I think

254
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,300
what is shown on the next page,

255
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,870
so there was a. Type in here that I connected my

256
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,040
hands and that was printed and copied, so each

257
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:19,170
link appears in four times the sum over words for

258
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,970
nearest neighbors. So we can define the overall

259
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,610
part of those four factors of the spin as that

260
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,730
leads to a capital P power that depends only on

261
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:38,960
the site and sums over all of the. Lower case

262
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,770
powers, zero or one, the corresponding to these

263
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,200
four banks being either on or off.

264
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,700
And then.

265
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:56,420
Repeating that for all and of the links all end of

266
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,910
the spectrum, the system. Accounting for all of

267
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:06,600
the. Links that they are attached to. We can move

268
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,100
the configuration over to the spin's themselves

269
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,740
through the skin independence concept vectors, see

270
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:24,650
the OR side. And consider what happens in the

271
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,820
overall plot oversights as we sum over all

272
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,780
possible values for the individual things that are

273
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:38,180
now raised to this complicated power, some for.

274
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:44,810
There are variables to zero one that live on the

275
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,450
four legs that has to be slight.

276
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,380
And as there are.

277
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,310
Only two possible values that each state can take,

278
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,590
the sum of each of the state variables in the

279
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,370
configuration. Some is fairly easy to think about.

280
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,730
It will break up in the usual way like this on the

281
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:20,730
long track, Chase will have. Horsfield. Yes, and

282
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:25,680
because neither minus one, plus one in the song,

283
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:31,220
you have the stuff going to one to this karaoke

284
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,590
and plus minus one race to the. So if Pat is on,

285
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:42,330
then those positive and negative contributions

286
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,180
will cancel. It will be the contribution of 08,

287
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,420
the petition function from that particular site

288
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,870
for this particular stinking federation. And as it

289
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,440
is a product overall site, the product as a whole

290
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,400
will be set to zero and just vanish. So the only

291
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,210
contributions to the petition function will come

292
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,890
when this summer over the powers of the four

293
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,000
nearest neighbor lakes is even either zero, two or

294
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
four. Those are the only possibilities that we

295
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,350
have, in which case these two contributions will

296
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:31,730
add some up to two. So. Any non-zero contribution

297
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,330
to the protection function will bring in this

298
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:42,190
factory to. And a chronic or delta defined here,

299
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,680
that is Delta up two to develop the knowledge to

300
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:54,550
chronic or Delta where this is very similar to the

301
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,900
usual chronic delta. It is one whenever the

302
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,190
argument is that even number. So it equals zero

303
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,840
bodies to.

304
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:13,050
Vanishes if the arguments over the powers are

305
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,820
never as much as non-zero.

306
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,120
So we can pull out those benefactors of to. In

307
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,590
front of all of the rest of the mutilations going

308
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,730
on that were left with just a. Product. Well,

309
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,780
that's. Break down, what is going on in? This

310
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:43,690
equation, 123 of the milestones of the procedure.

311
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:51,710
We have. No more thumbs over the stills, so all of

312
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,010
the original spin degrees of freedom have been

313
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,880
sold over that configuration. So you've accounted

314
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,570
for all of them and are left with the Cortini

315
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,780
configuration. So we introduced over the Powers

316
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,250
011. So Oversight's.

317
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,560
And for all of those considerations, we take the

318
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:25,240
product of regulatory functions. Over all of those

319
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,620
sites and then multiply that by the product out

320
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:36,490
and by two product deltas that require that. For

321
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:42,310
peace on both sides or add up to an even number,

322
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:46,090
some even number of links connected to each site

323
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:53,890
is turned on and. The key that makes this tricky.

324
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,410
Is that in order for that product to be down zero,

325
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,340
every single site has to have an even number of

326
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,160
links connected to it as we go across this whole

327
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,100
two dimensional lattice and sites. So there are

328
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,380
there's a set of and interrelated constraints on

329
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,590
this petition function. As

330
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,630
as we checked, to make sure that all the powers

331
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:34,390
connected to giving sites and even number of those

332
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:38,230
powers also affect the similar things at all, the

333
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,050
nearest neighbor sites that have their three other

334
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:45,010
contributions that then have to add up to even

335
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,280
numbers in terms.

336
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,290
Although we've taken care of the original some of

337
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,730
the Oscar configurations you now have at the.

338
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,110
The new configuration cell that we introduced over

339
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,370
configurations of links being pulled off is now

340
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,870
subject to an interrelated constraints.

341
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:27,130
Ensuring that at every later sites there is a.

342
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,800
Even number of links to another zero two four four.

343
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,590
And what these constraints are. Effectively

344
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:44,240
telling us is that the on off variables we've

345
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,310
introduced are not really independent, which may

346
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,290
be intuitively obvious given that there are twice

347
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,170
as many links interventions as there are sites.

348
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,650
And if we started off with a statistical system

349
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:02,000
that had only been seven degrees of freedom with

350
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,360
two values we've tried to rewrite, we've

351
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,040
successfully rewritten that in terms of a

352
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,420
different set to enter those again, each with two

353
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,110
values, zero one rather than plus or minus one.

354
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:22,310
There is necessarily some redundancy in. The sum

355
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,910
of all configurations of that larger number of

356
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,780
degrees of freedom that is representing the

357
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,520
original system. So at this point, if you were

358
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,320
trying to solve the easy model in this way, we

359
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:42,340
might seem a bit stuck in possibly going down the

360
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,950
wrong alley.

361
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:50,770
And maybe I should pause before going out just to

362
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,580
check in that everything, the manipulation is

363
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:59,530
going on so far here, along with the qualitative

364
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,650
story that. We've done a bunch of manipulations to

365
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,920
our system and something that, if anything, looks

366
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,910
even trickier to solve than be at our starting

367
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:15,150
points in terms of the degrees of freedom.

368
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:27,840
The. triple-O. The key is that having gone through

369
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,530
this procedure to replace the original seven

370
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,880
degrees of freedom with these new link variables,

371
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:41,070
people subject for years, they say, OK, we can

372
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,260
partially undo, unwind that work by introducing a

373
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:53,670
new set of. Spins plus or minus one, and then try

374
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,390
working backwards to get more or less back to our

375
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,920
starting points, but we're not exactly undoing

376
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,300
everything we've done. And getting back to the

377
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,670
original case, we want to do something a bit

378
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:11,260
different. So that we don't just. Undo all the

379
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,850
work we did, but instead simplify the current

380
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,010
expressions to get back to something that we can

381
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:23,650
recognize as. No easy model. So.

382
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:30,050
While we are introducing a new set of plus or

383
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:34,640
minus one spins, these have to be a different set

384
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,100
than the original ones we started off with so that

385
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,940
we can then. Come up with some relation between

386
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:46,570
the original spinnerets. And these so-called dual

387
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:51,780
spins, so still that that are associated with each

388
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,760
side and like the original spin's, take the values

389
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:01,730
plus or minus one. That we now want to relate to

390
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,780
the values of the powers that without the link.

391
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,620
The mathematical expressions here at the bottom of

392
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,130
the page that do this relation are maybe.

393
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:22,020
Unintuitive to look at what we have, we can easily

394
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,940
check that these products of the Tilted Spin's

395
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,300
take values plus or minus one, so that when we

396
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,270
have one minus that product of the two that

397
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,350
corresponds to.

398
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:41,300
Link powers of either zero one player, but how

399
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:47,800
exactly we decided that the. Power of link one

400
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,220
four should be related to dual spans, three and

401
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:57,890
four is best revealed by. Identifying these dual

402
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:03,410
stems with the geometry of the latter system. And

403
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,770
specifically identifying them with the so-called

404
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:11,960
dual address, which is on a more basic concept

405
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,900
that we've not really gone into so much in this

406
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,870
module. The idea is that.

407
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:25,310
Dual legacies are those that connects the central

408
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:29,210
points of each of the cells of the specifically

409
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:33,170
two dimensional lattice, it's easier to see where.

410
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,820
We draw a small

411
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,460
square lattice in two dimensions and go through

412
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,870
the procedure, I mentioned connecting all the

413
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,700
symptoms of this.

414
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,320
I swear that is the size of that square lattice

415
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:04,070
identified with the centers of the placates of the

416
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:09,950
original letters and what we have done in the

417
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,320
equations on the previous page,

418
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:22,550
20 feet on the screen, or what is related to the

419
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:28,240
two dual spins to the link of the original lattice

420
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,480
that crosses between them. So if I draw in the

421
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,230
duel links that do a lattice. We can see that. We

422
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:44,050
want to hear between spin one, spin two is

423
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:49,110
separating dual spins, one to agree with that. But

424
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,080
if we go to the other side where that link one for

425
00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:01,280
separating the other pair of dual spins. As to the

426
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,660
three and the four, and it's this graphical

427
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,860
procedure that uniquely specifies how each link in

428
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:15,710
the original lattice is connected to the pairs of

429
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,430
dual standards that separates so.

430
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,470
That duopolies construction is how all of these

431
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:30,090
relations are determined, specifying which link

432
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,950
variable is connected to which to spin variables,

433
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,290
and

434
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:41,320
what we can see based on that connection is, first

435
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,090
of all, that we are reaffirming that the link

436
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,530
variables are not all dependent. We can see that,

437
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:57,700
for example, two of them are depend on each of the

438
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,970
first things that we have considered here. So if

439
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,840
you want to amplify both depend on which will spin

440
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,170
as to the one.

441
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,280
And for instance, one four people, one three both

442
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:16,030
depend on the doorstep, three rapidly, that's just

443
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,830
because there are.

444
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:24,100
Links to the original Latisse appearing on both

445
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,070
sides of each of the dual Spillane's that we've

446
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,700
put into this universelle that is that generalized

447
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:36,410
for all and. Spins in the form two dimensional

448
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:40,310
lattice, as well as the dual two dimensional as.

449
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,740
In addition to confirming that the link variables

450
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:55,320
PJAK, the powers that be introduced, manipulations

451
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:57,280
of the petition function

452
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,050
in addition to confirming that there's not

453
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:06,340
independence, the patterns of dependence that we

454
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:10,980
have introduced by working in terms of these dual

455
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:16,300
variables are exactly what we need to take care of

456
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,450
the. Not to try to belittle factors in the sense

457
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:24,920
that if we look at the four powers that

458
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,170
contributes to. This particular spin at the center

459
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,600
of the cell here.

460
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,490
And add up all of the foreign contributions in

461
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:43,260
terms of the two things we get for factors, half

462
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,530
the world is.

463
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:56,170
For factors of happiness, for relations and then

464
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:00,130
subtracting from that, the sum over all four pairs.

465
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,930
Of products of dual spins, which we can factor

466
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:10,670
into a product of to some of the spins. With

467
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,500
digital spin as being either. Plus one or minus

468
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,370
one, there are only three values that the sum of

469
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,480
two of them can take.

470
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:26,930
Minus two, zero and plus two, if we have both of

471
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,820
them being a plus two, then we have four of the

472
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:35,860
two is to try to give us a zero. If all four of

473
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:42,650
them are, if you like, minus two. We have. This is

474
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,420
the same minus two squared is four two two zero,

475
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,310
if any of them are zero factors. So plus one minus

476
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,190
four plus one plus minus one that we just have the

477
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:58,130
two left over. And if one set is.

478
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,110
Plus two and the other is minus. And we have two

479
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:09,820
minus two or four, so the only possibilities that

480
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:13,300
are allowed by the usual spin formulation are for

481
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:19,000
the number of links to other sites to be even so

482
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,280
that the product over all those interdependent.

483
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,240
Trying to give Delta functions not to just

484
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,060
collapses to to be one.

485
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:34,860
And.

486
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,550
We already, to some extent, went through the other

487
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,470
exercise, the other piece of the puzzle that needs

488
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,550
to be in place in order for this dualistic

489
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,250
formulation to be a legitimate way of rewriting

490
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,140
the system.

491
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,740
We have to be able to show that all possible. Oh,

492
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:06,040
values or possible ways of obtaining. Even numbers

493
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:11,410
of links to sites are accounted for by the dual

494
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:17,080
standards that we have defined their relations to.

495
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,480
The links that appear between them.

496
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:27,280
So we've shown that zero, two and four are all

497
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,430
accounted for and right at. Explicitly.

498
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:50,810
If we set this sum over the next one to be four,

499
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,500
then that's rearranges to tell us that the product

500
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,650
of these two sons of the dual spin's.

501
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:11,630
Has to be negative for. So. Rearranging, pulling

502
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,940
that one half spin product backward to the left

503
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,640
hand side, we get it equal to two times to minus

504
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,690
for just two times negative two, which is four.

505
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:29,610
And the only way to achieve that with the spin is

506
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,830
plus or minus one is to have one of the factors,

507
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:35,950
the two multiplied by the other being negative two.

508
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:41,010
So. There are two ways.

509
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,260
Achieving that either.

510
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,140
One in three, both being one, two and four, both

511
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:03,320
being negative one or the opposite, flipping every.

512
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,120
Stephen.

513
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,270
In a coordinated way.

514
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,520
So in general, at least for single example, we've

515
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,080
been looking at here.

516
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,620
There are two configurations of the dual spin's

517
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:31,470
that leave the corresponding to each configuration

518
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:37,410
of the link powers that be reformulated our system

519
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:41,370
and to start off with so interchangeable.

520
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:47,910
Of those dual spins to negative values.

521
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:57,960
And all of the P j k factors. Would be unchanged.

522
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,190
So.

523
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:06,130
This isn't quite the full proof that this is

524
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:11,740
possible to generalise before and spin the system,

525
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,230
which you can find in a pretty nice way, the

526
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,860
interview from before any of us were born.

527
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,970
I was just. Say that it turns out to be the case,

528
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:27,330
that what we've done for one side here generalizes

529
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,800
to the full dual system despite the

530
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,960
interconnections between the different sites and

531
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:39,930
links. So if we rewrite that configuration so over

532
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:44,670
the powers of the link, the links are off in terms

533
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:50,310
of the usual using. Configuration some over these

534
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:53,970
dual spins, minus one. You just need to stick in

535
00:41:54,540 --> 00:42:00,120
this extra power, but have to compensate for the

536
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:04,100
double counting from negating all values of those

537
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,820
things. So

538
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:13,920
we now have even further progress and got rid of

539
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,280
the.

540
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Of all dependents or explicit dependents, I should

541
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,340
say, on the spin degrees of freedom and all that

542
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,120
is left apart from factors of two, it's just a

543
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,780
bunch of hyper trigonometric functions that now

544
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:37,060
depend on the values it spends at the side of the

545
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,840
door and sort of taking the product over all those

546
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,140
nearest neighbor pairs dual Latisse.

547
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:50,130
Which just requires a little bit more

548
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:58,170
trigonometric manipulation. Where we can proceed

549
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:02,610
just by doing another identification that is easy

550
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:06,750
enough to check. Remember that we want this

551
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:11,010
capital city to be hyperbolic, cosine, what is

552
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:18,200
index is zero and we assign the index as one. So

553
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,370
this idea of identity is easy to check in both of

554
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:24,850
those cases are confirmed, that will be a zero.

555
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,940
The exponential factor, that's one we get the

556
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:32,000
cosine. The key is one that we have been

557
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,360
exponential of the law, which just brings down its

558
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,560
arguments, the senge over Coche of the cost and

559
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:40,680
the.

560
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:48,390
So that is quick check and then we substitute in

561
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:54,530
the. Relation between each of these links and the

562
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:58,100
original letters, which we define as capital C

563
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:03,650
variable and the product of dual spins of the two

564
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:07,370
sides that are separated by the corresponding link,

565
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,910
and conveniently because we're doing this for

566
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:13,480
every site, Bilitis, we don't have to be careful

567
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,560
track of exactly which dual speeds are separated

568
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,020
by exactly which links. We just know that all

569
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:26,360
pairs will be accounted for in the overall sum. So

570
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:33,710
the two factors in this exponential. Are going to

571
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:38,630
be or can be just broken up, how this first term,

572
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,230
the one half can be moved inside the log and the

573
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:44,540
exponential of the cancers that were actually left

574
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:47,870
with the torchbearer, the times, the square root

575
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,720
of attention. So that cancels out the square root

576
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,040
of the cause. It brings in the square root of the.

577
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,300
Out front reduces to that factor and then there is

578
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,560
just the dual spin defense attorney now hiding out

579
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:10,050
as the coefficient on the one hand and exponential

580
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:14,510
so somewhat. Normally, when you're packing things

581
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:19,610
that we can simplify by converting the product

582
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:20,300
overall,

583
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,820
nearest neighbor, pairs of the dual. So we have

584
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:33,330
here. The product. Exponentially now can be recast

585
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:37,230
just as the exponential of some reversing the very

586
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,930
first thing that we did, everything else is

587
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,020
independent of the dual spins that can come out in

588
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:49,070
front of the configuration. And if we say. That's

589
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,000
the three factor on the song over the years,

590
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:54,500
repairs is just some.

591
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:00,030
Dual temperature, dual temperature in Childhelp,

592
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:03,720
then we can recognize everything apart from that

593
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,520
pretty factor as the partition function for the

594
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,890
two dimensional using model. Add this to Obeida

595
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:17,850
given by negative a half of the log of the

596
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:22,910
tensions of the original temperature. I guess

597
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,070
there's just enough time to.

598
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:33,690
Confirm that this is. The destination we started

599
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,550
targeting right at the beginning, so we have the

600
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:43,050
dual production function where if we rearrange

601
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:49,740
this equation to isolate. The typical tangent of

602
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:55,150
Peter. There has to be an exponential besides the

603
00:46:55,170 --> 00:47:00,990
negative two times of the children. So if I take

604
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:06,400
so easily to belittle that and then subtract the

605
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,300
minus to the child, that is.

606
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:16,280
One over the of the inverse of this relation,

607
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,400
minus the tangent itself.

608
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:25,060
We can break up into a.

609
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:31,830
Of simply because.

610
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:39,720
Within.

611
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:51,690
And.

612
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:59,220
Then getting that all into. The common denominator

613
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,200
is what to do with half square miles of central

614
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:06,020
square, the usual. Relation, one that we're

615
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:09,650
probably familiar with, and then that cost the

616
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:15,400
times since Batur, which we can recognize or churn

617
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,310
through the.

618
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:26,340
The formula cost. They have essentially the best

619
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:33,110
quarter. In the Beda plus either minus beta, the

620
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:42,360
minus minus beta. Gives us quarter EBITDA minus.

621
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,790
Minus two, which was a half.

622
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:56,210
Synch to data, we are not putting in the values

623
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:59,630
factors, other half with this since Peter.

624
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:05,590
Research, censorship of. To ensure that equal to

625
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:12,280
one over. I don't like the formula since to date

626
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,500
itself, which was the point we started off

627
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,590
targeting the relation between the temperatures of

628
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:26,550
the two. I do all systems, so run out of time with

629
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:30,810
just final qualitative comments to get through, we

630
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:33,690
got through all of the mathematical manipulations,

631
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:38,220
so we'll pick up tomorrow morning in the other

632
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:44,330
room, quickly, see what it means. What benefit

633
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:49,550
does this do you give us that for there to be some

634
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,670
more broader applications to start ramping up the

635
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,960
pull the module? So the final question, questions

636
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,630
for today

637
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,410
have a chance to follow up about anything until

638
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:09,860
tomorrow morning. But I've got a few.
