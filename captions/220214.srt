1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,490
OK, just about able to get things set up in time

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,230
for the top of the hour.  The first thing to set up is

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,090
that magic number for today.

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,250
Here it is: four eight three

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,200
five two five.

6
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,040
Now that is up there for you. Are

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,570
there any questions left over from last week?

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:55,200
Brief recap on the 14th of February. Welcome to week

9
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,670
three of Statistical Physics.

10
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,070
Last week, we finished going through the

11
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,080
probability foundations and went into the like on

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,610
some levels they have tried. Just way this kind of

13
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,640
stuff, I cringe a bit more pleasurable, it seemed

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,650
to be on Friday. And what we focused on specific

15
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:30,540
to report last week was this concept of we more

16
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,320
famous conceptual quantities in statistical

17
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,920
physics, which we have have seen now both. In a

18
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,660
general definition, that depends on the suburb of

19
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,340
microstates, of probabilities of those microstates

20
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,950
or specializing to micro canonical ensemble.

21
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,050
Interpreter David.

22
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,880
We are all of these probabilities are equal for

23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,590
every micro state in the system, the entropy just

24
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,770
reduces to the logarithm of the total number of

25
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,040
microstates that this micro economical system can

26
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,940
have at the micro economical system. Is the.

27
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,930
Ensemble that's generated by the illusion of a set

28
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:31,440
of particles subject to conservation of energy and

29
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,440
particle, No.

30
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,060
Those are the conditions defining the biker

31
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,730
canonical ensemble, and later this week, we will

32
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,390
address those to a different set of conditions

33
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,720
defining the canonical.

34
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,710
Give an interview, Russell. The second law. Of

35
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,670
thermodynamics.

36
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,650
The statement that the Entropia.

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,940
Does not decrease. As time goes on, the engineer

38
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:14,110
actually increases. So the amount of entropy in

39
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,430
the universe really in a closed system can never

40
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,420
decrease, needs to increase as time goes on, which

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,060
provided. A more general definition of

42
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,560
thermodynamic equilibrium.

43
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,910
Should be the. Situation.

44
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:45,740
Or the context where the entropy of the system. Is

45
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,610
maximised.

46
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,090
So.

47
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:57,120
Taking the derivative maximum entropy observed it

48
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,080
so much that it's not fitting on the screen.

49
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,540
Hopefully I can spell that out, jump back to the

50
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,060
actual place in the lecture notes that we were

51
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,700
looking at last week on Friday, where we have gone

52
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,250
through the process of maximizing the entropy,

53
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,600
modifying it by adding a multiplier to account for

54
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,650
the requirement that the probabilities all add up

55
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,090
to one hundred percent when some of the old

56
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,130
microstates of the system

57
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,870
from that maximisation of the entropy, for the

58
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,550
canonical example, were able to derive the result.

59
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,940
Now that into a dynamic equilibrium, the

60
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,700
probabilities for each microstates in the micro

61
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,150
canonical ensemble is a constant and is therefore

62
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,460
equal to the inverse of the total number of

63
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,960
microstates in order to satisfy this constraint of

64
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,080
probability. So that's where we are. Are there

65
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,880
questions about. Any of that?

66
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,810
Where we are going from here is to continue

67
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,800
driving quantities in the canonical ensemble. We

68
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,290
started off with entropy is the first the most

69
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,980
famous derived quantity. But in this micro

70
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,020
canonical framework, that's. Leaves the conserve

71
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,400
energy and particle no as the fundamental defining

72
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,610
quantities. Also, the temperature itself of the

73
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,720
system becomes the quantity that we derive based

74
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,650
on the most fundamental and defining quantities of

75
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,630
internal energy particle and throughout the.

76
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,060
Remainder of. And this is this module as a whole

77
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,780
will just be working in equilibrium, which is

78
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,680
where this definition of the temperature is well

79
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,300
defined, where we can expect the temperature and

80
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,870
all other derived qualities to be functions of

81
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,570
those conserved energy particle numbers and the

82
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,850
temperature that we derive. We'll be. At the

83
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,520
fundamental level, a function of energy and

84
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,730
political no. So what what we will do, rather than

85
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,580
going through a long duration of what the

86
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,180
temperature might be, is simply state definition

87
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,880
and then try to see try to make some sense out of

88
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,290
it and see that it behaves or doesn't behave the

89
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,230
way that we are used to a temperature behaving in

90
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,140
everyday situations. So the definition of

91
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,100
temperature is the microeconomic sample is always

92
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:02,070
the thought of Librium. Is this T to the inverse

93
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,390
temperature? Is the derivative of the entropy with

94
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,050
respect to the internal energy. With that fixed

95
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:16,780
particle. No imposed. So. It's been just a minute

96
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,400
or two to try to make sense out of this. We call

97
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,450
that the. Microeconomic entreprise, dynamic

98
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,580
equilibrium is.

99
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,440
They're just awarded a number of microstates, this

100
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,820
equation. Is that derivative with respect to

101
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,870
internal energy? More are the number of

102
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:47,380
microstates fixed number. So in words, if we say

103
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,340
add a bit of energy to the system, we can expect

104
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,430
that to change the number of microstates that the

105
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,090
system can access, that can cycle between

106
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,090
environmental equilibrium with some probabilities.

107
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,460
And the change in that number of microstates is

108
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,160
then pushed through the logarithm to define a

109
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:16,690
change. Entropy and the ratio of change. The the

110
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,970
number of microstates that become accessible with

111
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,070
this change in energy is the inverse temperature.

112
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,790
So. If we were to say that adding just a little

113
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,380
bit of energy to the system would cause a big

114
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,230
change in the number of accessible microstates,

115
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:39,060
the big increase in entropy, then we would have

116
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,990
this large positive number is universal

117
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,610
temperature that would apply on the temperature.

118
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,330
So we can.

119
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,770
Intuition for that by thinking that low

120
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,220
temperatures, the system is very sensitive to a

121
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,340
small amount of energy being added in, whereas in

122
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,340
the opposite limits, if we were to add in a small

123
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,760
amount of energy, a small increase in the entropy,

124
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,090
we would interpret that as a high temperature

125
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,600
system. Already has a lot of thermal energy, is

126
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,750
not so sensitive to a little bit more being added

127
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,050
in.

128
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:24,080
But all of that. Discussion is obviously very

129
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,770
handwaving.

130
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:31,550
And I won't bother to read any of the job of try

131
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,030
to. Make this all a bit more concrete and less

132
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:42,210
abstract by turning to the usual system and spins

133
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,280
in a line in a magnetic field, defining the energy

134
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:53,070
of the system is minus H to the strength of the

135
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,710
magnetic field times. The negative of the

136
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,360
difference between the. A number of things pointed

137
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,250
up, combined with magnetic field, which is in flux,

138
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,600
and the number of spins into a lot of you're at

139
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,230
minus.

140
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:15,930
No.

141
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,330
But we are going to need to do more to figure out

142
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,430
the temperature of the system is figuring out how

143
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,700
the entropia. Of these and spins depends on the

144
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,250
amount of energy that they have, which in turn

145
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,670
depends on the number of microstates batteries and

146
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,920
Spitzkoppe access, we think of the amount of

147
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,350
energy. So we will see that

148
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,300
each different value of energy strictly defines a

149
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,460
different microbiological system with a different

150
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,300
number of accessible microstates. And the way that

151
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,740
that. That number of accessible microstates

152
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,810
changes defies the entropy in the derivative of

153
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,970
the interview with respect to that, changeability

154
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,950
gives us the inverse temperature. So that is the

155
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,760
first computer functional forms for the total

156
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,220
number of microstates, which we can then turn the

157
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,530
crank and get the temperature out as a function of

158
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,220
energy. The fundamental variable in the mind

159
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,740
canonical.

160
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,840
Now, we have to do that is count the number of

161
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,820
states that we have for a fixed amount of energy,

162
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:41,280
it may be worth building up to this by considering

163
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,460
a few simple special cases.

164
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,990
I can't remember if we've looked at this already

165
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,380
in the past, can anyone shout out what the lowest

166
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,080
energy configuration would be for these and

167
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,900
dispense with that magnetic field pointing out?

168
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:28,560
Exactly, it's just wrong. It's expensive to spend

169
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,210
all day doing it the end plus is the number of

170
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:37,380
spins pointing up a like with magnetic field that

171
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,100
brings in a negative energy. So the energy

172
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,190
response to this is zero for the lowest possible.

173
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:52,320
Energy is just all capital out of this spins

174
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:58,190
pointing up so any little and plus equals and.

175
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:06,060
And. Building on that, what would be what would be

176
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,400
the representative configuration of spin's would

177
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,560
be next lowest possible energy?

178
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,320
What would that look like if I were to draw it?

179
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,090
And the rate of this. Boxier.

180
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:34,880
Was that.

181
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,200
So they're all in the same direction they want,

182
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,800
that's where we got the lowest energy, what we

183
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,070
want now is the different system that has the next

184
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,250
lowest energy. So one of.

185
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,190
One step, one energy level higher than what we

186
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,390
call that grandstanders.

187
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:09,170
And why exactly so. Any one of these can be

188
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:14,240
pointed down and that brings in is now and minus

189
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:22,460
one and minus one. So instead of. The lowest

190
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,420
possible energy with minus and H we have.

191
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,970
And one gauge plus gauge from that one spin that

192
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,850
is into alignment of the magnetic field. Which

193
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:44,160
ends up being minus 10, minus two times H.

194
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,150
And now we can see what is written in the text

195
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,890
above here, that in order to count the number of

196
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,430
microstates for these systems, we have to figure

197
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,980
out all the possible ways that pairs of spins can

198
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,060
slip while keeping the energy the same. So, for

199
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,970
instance, in. On the right here, I could just as

200
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,920
easily control one negative, the one down putting

201
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,460
spin in that position. So flipping the third spin

202
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,400
from upside down and flipping the fourth standard

203
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,310
for the upcoming repairs to be fixed. There are.

204
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,570
And possible ways of choosing that one down or

205
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:37,260
pointing spin. Out of the. Total number of spins

206
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,620
that we have, so the total number of microstates

207
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,960
is that impossible ways of choosing which spin has

208
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,680
worked against the magnetic field in the Alos

209
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,320
energy case. Those conflicts are possible with

210
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,550
that same energy, so people the micro state is the

211
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,370
single one that is written down here with this

212
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:08,370
minimal energy, and we can recognize that this is

213
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,940
just the number of ways I could choose one that

214
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,050
would want to expand out of the enterable. And

215
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:20,940
there is a typo in this equation, 43, where I want

216
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,290
to have these labels aligned with e0, and it would

217
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:30,480
appear this should really be. Yourself and minus

218
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,060
the number of microstates that. Respond to this

219
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,100
energy with some number and minus is expense,

220
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,590
expense opposite to the magnetic field is just the

221
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,470
binomial fact is that choosing and minus spins out

222
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,720
of the total, which because and plus plus and

223
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,860
minus equals and is exactly the same as choosing

224
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:05,370
and plus spins out of the total. And in both cases

225
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,030
it is just the total capital and factorial divided

226
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,930
by and plus vectorial over in minus factorial and

227
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,730
minus being.

228
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,890
And minus and plus, as we've seen before.

229
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,290
Now we have the total number of microstates. The

230
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,980
next step on our way to the temperature is to take

231
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,980
the logarithm of that and then take the derivative.

232
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,290
The complication is that derivatives of factories

233
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:43,480
are. Inconvenient. So we go through a little

234
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,230
extended exercise here to recast the aspect

235
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,190
horribleness in terms of a nice continuous

236
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,210
function, and at the same time, this would be a

237
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:01,850
way to express the. Factories here in terms of the

238
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,050
fundamental conservative qualities, the energy

239
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,030
particle, one of which we want to fix and the

240
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,240
other which we want to take a derivative with

241
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,060
respect to. And the way to do this is to model or

242
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,170
interpret the spin system as a random walk. In the

243
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:27,090
interviews that these inspectors have, so whenever

244
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:31,440
we imagine any spin to the system taking a step

245
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,720
and the correspondent random walk in the energy

246
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,840
space of the system, well, there are two

247
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,020
possibilities to speed up, along with magnetic

248
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,320
field or down into the one with. If we considered

249
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,930
the energy brutalized by the negative image is to

250
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:57,110
make things dimensionless, then. We know from the

251
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,170
energy we've written down already that when this

252
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,950
bill points up. This is quantity X, we'll consider

253
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:09,600
the length of the walk is going to increase in the

254
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,230
following way and plus we've increased by one in

255
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,220
the total number of spins in the system and will

256
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,580
increase by. So the overall increase in X is to

257
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,600
minus one equals one, whereas the other case has

258
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,510
been reported down and we added it to the system.

259
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,040
That total number in would still increase by one,

260
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,240
but it doesn't stay the same, and this X would

261
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,120
change by zero minus one, which is negative. So

262
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,930
every time we consider adding a spin to the system,

263
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,230
this position of the walker and the random is

264
00:19:52,240 --> 00:20:01,020
based. Either takes a step plus or minus one. So

265
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,550
it's a. System and steps of equal length, and

266
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:10,140
because we don't impose any preference for weather,

267
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,450
the next thing going into the system is going to

268
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,550
point up or down. We have equal probabilities for.

269
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,460
The walk to take a step in each of those

270
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,860
directions, the language that we looked at this

271
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,850
time last week, that's just probability P. Q is

272
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,390
equal to one half of stepping in either direction

273
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,860
up or down in energy.

274
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:43,870
And we know in this system, in this context, that

275
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:50,260
every one of the two, the power and possible walks

276
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,340
or possible configurations of these spins is

277
00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:00,560
equally probable. So the overall probability that

278
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:05,180
our work ends in a configuration with a particular

279
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:11,110
value in plus and the corresponding energy event

280
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:18,980
plus or minus is just the number of those walks

281
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:24,260
with that fixed number of steps in the positive

282
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,830
direction divided by the total number of possible

283
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,150
configurations. Which is what's written here,

284
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,960
division, by the total number of possibilities and

285
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,770
the number of ways that you can, plus positive

286
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,010
steps of the energy out of the total number of

287
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,550
steps. And we can recognize from the equation

288
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,180
three that despite the little factor is just the

289
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,150
number of. Microstates we are interested in

290
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,630
probably the number of microstates is to the end

291
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,060
times, the probability of ending up with a random

292
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,450
walk.

293
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:10,510
And plus steps in the positive direction with the

294
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,610
energy we are interested in.

295
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:21,860
Is this approach clear so far? That's not so, we

296
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,290
just keep doing the same thing that we did in

297
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,100
fiction one point five and hit this with the

298
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,020
central bureau.

299
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,560
We know that the central limit theorem relates the

300
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,010
probability distribution for this and that random

301
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:44,600
walk in the energy space of the this system. To

302
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,790
the mean and variance of. The single step in that

303
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,840
process is spin the title, put it up or down, if

304
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,040
we average over those two possibilities, I should

305
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,110
say, sum up those two possibilities with equal

306
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:07,350
probabilities. We get the case because they have

307
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,040
the material and the variance is exactly the same

308
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,430
as we had in that unit, one variances for

309
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,610
particular, but of half, that's one plug that into

310
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,130
the central limit theorem. We find that the

311
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,900
continuous probability distribution for reaching.

312
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,840
Index energy.

313
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,550
Age is this Gaussian function around? X squared

314
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:46,670
over two times, the number of steps with the

315
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,990
overall normalization factor out front is always.

316
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,670
The next step is, again, building on what we did

317
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,340
and the appropriate foundations, taking this

318
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,130
probability distribution and extracting an actual

319
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,090
probability from it. Easiest way to do that. So

320
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:11,050
that can be a formula that we have to integrate

321
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:18,790
over some interval in the continuous X, the energy

322
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,760
of the system in order to extract the probability

323
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,800
from the distribution. The simplest approximation

324
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,400
to that integral is its central value.

325
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:37,800
We're. The over by this age is next, it is this

326
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:45,800
two. And plus minus 10. So the simple counsel

327
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,650
approximation to the probability is central value

328
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:53,030
of the distribution of the interval multiplied. By

329
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:57,530
the width of the interval. And that width of the

330
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:02,450
interval here is the distance that the ball

331
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,480
travels with the energy, adding another spin to

332
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,900
the system. The change, if we have a stand up

333
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,420
there has been pointed down, is just one.

334
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:22,900
So then. With the. Expression we had at the end of

335
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,940
the previous page that.

336
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,110
The total number of microstates is two of the end

337
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,180
times, this probability that we want to end is one,

338
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,970
the probability becomes the central value in that

339
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:42,860
distribution, which is just to the end, multiplied

340
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,380
by the distribution that we have. Already.

341
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,560
OK, many steps that just not done. We now have a

342
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,390
continuous function for a number of microstates of

343
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:05,380
this system as a function of the total energy, and

344
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,680
we just need to take this derivative with the

345
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,140
number of particles fixed. So.

346
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:18,030
I can go ahead and write down the logarithm of

347
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,720
this expression, you're going to do this in the

348
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,130
easy way. The logarithm of the product is the sum

349
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,400
of the water and the logarithm of the exponential

350
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:34,050
is just the arguments of the exponential to each

351
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,550
and everything else is. Independence, he will drop

352
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:46,070
out of that derivative. So what is the derivative

353
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,200
that we have in the end?

354
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:01,010
Yes, because I. That was the previous one, which

355
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:01,760
is now fixed.

356
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,560
This is one over the temperature or written below

357
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,890
the temperature with this approximation of margin

358
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,180
to bring the central element to bear is negative

359
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,110
energy squared divided by a.

360
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,990
So does this temperature for a spin system, the

361
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,620
excess?

362
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,730
I see you shaking your head in several ways, it

363
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,610
does not see it's not completely crazy.

364
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,290
One. One thing that does seem suspicious about

365
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:48,400
this is that in the case where the energy goes to

366
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,940
zero one, obviously divided by zero is something

367
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,160
problematic. The temperature seems to diverge.

368
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,340
When there are roughly equal numbers of upward

369
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,810
pointing at government expense in the system, what

370
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,960
may even be more confusing is that whenever the

371
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,350
energy of this system is positive, some there are

372
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,920
more stimuli against the magnetic field that there

373
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,090
are with the magnetic field than it is positive.

374
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,960
Each good as positive is positive or negative. So

375
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,050
we have a negative temperature coming out of our

376
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:25,740
definition.

377
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:32,590
And. We can check that's what's going on, there is

378
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:36,790
actually, yes, we have a system that has has more

379
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,390
speed to the line against the magnetic field and

380
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,430
we try to increase its energy by putting in

381
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,580
another piece of energy, that same handwaving

382
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,360
argument we went through before. We eventually

383
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,410
find fewer and fewer micro states so lower and

384
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:57,970
lower entropy as the energy increases. So the

385
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:05,140
limit there is actually. If we were to consider.

386
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:12,540
The. Maximum energy configuration of this system,

387
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,400
so instead of all this goes around. Parallel to

388
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,520
the extreme external feel, we have the bottom line

389
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,670
against it. The energy is plus and age so positive.

390
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,220
And if we were to. Try to add another piece of

391
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,830
energy, but we find that we can't. This is the

392
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:39,830
maximum, so there is the change. No change in

393
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,430
microstates is no fine if we were to go down there,

394
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:48,650
if we were to start from the next to maximal

395
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:54,030
energy positive and minus two times each and add a

396
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,390
piece of energy that we would see the number of

397
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:00,250
microstates decreasing from 10 to one, it's

398
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,390
exactly that decrease. That's.

399
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,420
Corresponds what produces this negative

400
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,640
temperature. We will call natural systems those

401
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,900
where this does not happen. So this unsuspended

402
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,340
system is one natural because there's an upper

403
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,250
bound on the amount of energy you can have, which

404
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:27,360
it is not standard in most physical systems.

405
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:33,510
In most natural systems, we can assume that the

406
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,370
number of microstates increases with more energy.

407
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,990
So adding energy to the system makes additional

408
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,180
microstates accessible.

409
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:48,790
And that is what we will restrict our attention to

410
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,720
specify that the majority of the spin's are

411
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,410
aligned with the magnetic field so that the energy

412
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:59,830
is negative, the temperature is positive. Just one

413
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:04,330
last remark we can see here. Is that because we

414
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,530
have a non-zero minimum energy that we wrote down

415
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,710
on the previous page of these notes? There is also

416
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:18,230
a. Not zero minimum temperature. Which is just.

417
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,730
Equal to the strength of the magnetic field when

418
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:28,140
the energy takes the value that you found. So

419
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,650
there are some things here, but there are some

420
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:35,920
aspects of this temperature that. Do better

421
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,890
expectations, at least when respect switch to this

422
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:43,360
natural regime and specifically the expectation

423
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,430
that you will think about is what happens when two

424
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,780
systems with two different temperatures are

425
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,940
brought into thermal contact with of exchange

426
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,970
energy with each other before diving into that?

427
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,970
Are there questions about the microeconomic

428
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:04,120
definition of temperature for this somewhat

429
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:08,310
response system? We've looked at so far

430
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:17,330
is part of the problem. So the temperatures are

431
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:27,850
coming. Just to stand up and just as soon as you.

432
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,010
Yeah, so the temperatures are coming out of the

433
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:35,790
microeconomic approach is not exactly what we're

434
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:39,990
used to talking about in everyday life and in

435
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,350
particular in the school system, we can't set that

436
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,420
temperature to zero the way that you could imagine

437
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:50,880
thinking of an absolute zero. So probably not

438
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,070
today, but tomorrow, certainly we will start

439
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,490
seeing the canonical approach where the

440
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,790
temperature is actually the three parameter and

441
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:05,700
can be set to whatever we want and. That that is

442
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,760
motivated by some of this microeconomic weirdness

443
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:13,540
and. That's actually the historical origin of

444
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,230
these names, the canonical is an English word sort

445
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:22,000
of means ordinary or standard. And when James was

446
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,270
developing these statistical approaches, again, I

447
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,720
think physical systems back in the nineteen

448
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,260
hundreds, you want to be standard, ordinary or

449
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,380
canonical ensemble to be the one where the

450
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,680
temperature behaves when we're used to the

451
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:44,140
microscopic cases, then. Some of the underlying

452
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,810
dynamics that relate more naturally to

453
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:50,020
conservation of energy, but less naturally to more

454
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,310
educated, experienced. Will reiterate that

455
00:33:54,310 --> 00:34:00,430
tomorrow. We do see what the canonical approach is

456
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,680
and how it differs from microtechnology, it is the

457
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:07,180
first let's try to rescue some everyday behavior

458
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,450
from microeconomic systems unless there are

459
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:11,240
professions.

460
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:22,030
The. Setup here is going to be a bit. Similar to

461
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,910
what we were talking about when we encountered it

462
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,040
in the second half of the year, we start off with

463
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:32,350
two isolated microeconomic systems, A, B, each of

464
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,500
which has its corresponding energy. And as we've

465
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,720
seen, the energy and the particle number together

466
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,740
discovered a corresponding temperature to a TV.

467
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:52,850
So. Focusing here again on the natural positive

468
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:56,680
temperatures for either these spin systems or

469
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,810
general micro economical systems, setting aside

470
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:03,520
the possibility of having. A negative divergence

471
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,640
temperature. This is. The generic case, that is.

472
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,790
Of interest in everyday situations and then having

473
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,670
taken these two initially isolated mitochondrial

474
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,850
samples, you bring them together to form a

475
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:26,290
combined ensemble, allowing them to exchange

476
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,850
energy, thermal contacts. This will change the

477
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,070
amount of energy about the amount of particles

478
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:36,910
that are in each of these two boxes. And if we

479
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,860
then we isolate.

480
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:44,910
These two subsystems, they will generally have.

481
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,910
Different energies called it a prime rib prime and

482
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:53,660
then correspondingly different temperatures. And

483
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,980
the question is, how do the final temperatures to

484
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,230
crime and to be crime depend on the official

485
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,210
temperatures today and.

486
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:12,100
What we expect is a net flow of energy.

487
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,990
So the exchange is going to have a definite

488
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:21,080
direction from the Hodor system to the cooler

489
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:27,390
system if we put. If we imagine putting two

490
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,400
systems together when it's hot, when it's cold,

491
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,070
say an ice cube and a cup of coffee, then we get

492
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,670
to the ice cube that the whole system to heat up

493
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,880
and at the same time cool down often by exchanging

494
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:44,200
energy with. So what we can do based on

495
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:50,590
microeconomic approach is. Definably this energy

496
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:54,600
flow, a Delta E for each of these systems may be

497
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,270
just to be the amount that the final energy after

498
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:02,150
this heat exchange differs from the initial energy.

499
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:08,400
And just for simplicity. We will suppose that this

500
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,970
change in energy is relatively small. Compared to

501
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:17,360
the overall energy scale, that is not a necessary

502
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,790
assumption and. I'm debating whether to put a

503
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,530
problem on the homework, looking in a different

504
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,920
way of doing this energy exchange calculation that

505
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,310
doesn't require doesn't rely on the assumption of

506
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:36,040
small energy. But one thing we know from the fact

507
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:40,660
that even the combined system of C is like

508
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:47,270
canonical and isolated. From its surroundings, the

509
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:51,610
total energy. In these two subsystems together,

510
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:54,370
there has to be concerned, which is to say

511
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,640
whatever energy flows out of this debate has to

512
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,160
flow in the system being. So we change the energy

513
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:09,240
industry, subsystems is equal and opposite. No. To

514
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,350
get the temperatures, we need the entropies, we

515
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,380
need to take their derivatives with respect to the

516
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:16,890
energy.

517
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,890
And if we assume that the entropy as a function of

518
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,460
energy is continuous and infinitely differentiable,

519
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,160
which is generally the case away from our call

520
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,630
phase, transitions will set aside for now and come

521
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:41,880
back to probably after the term break, then we can

522
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,400
just expand. The entropy of the final system is a

523
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,480
series around the entropy of the initial system,

524
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,250
plus this change in energy.

525
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,200
Multiplied by the derivative evidence of the

526
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,310
response of the entropy to the energy at the fixed

527
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:10,220
energy that we were expanding around. So we can

528
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,790
write this in terms of the initial temperatures,

529
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,620
disability, so be.

530
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,190
And that is. Fairly trivial, so just remembering

531
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,910
that the.

532
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,650
Derivatives. That appear in the state expansion or

533
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:42,530
just the temperature we have then? The final

534
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,200
entropy.

535
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:50,100
Is to leading order, neglecting effects that come

536
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,310
in is the square of this relatively small energy,

537
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:59,460
the initial entropy, plus the change in energy

538
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,390
divided by. The temperature of the derivative

539
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,940
becomes of whatever temperature factor.

540
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,380
And what we have already seen is from the Second

541
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,090
World, from the.

542
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,510
As we go through this process of bringing systems

543
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,640
together, putting them in terrible contact, let

544
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,370
them change energy and then be separating them

545
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,940
total energy of those two systems, whether they're

546
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:30,420
isolated or combined. Can never decrease as time

547
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,140
passes, so the final entropies that depend on

548
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:38,790
those final energy use need to be greater than or

549
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,500
equal to the initial entropies.

550
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,100
There's a bit of a calculation that could. You

551
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,310
don't here just to show that there is equality

552
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:02,820
between the entropy of the. Combined system where?

553
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,320
No contact is not allowed me to set some systems

554
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,780
or just considered together another entropies ad

555
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:15,570
as extensive as an extensive period of. This may

556
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:22,190
be worthwhile to check that. If we go through this

557
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,310
calculation, something over all possible values

558
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,100
for the distribution of the total energy between

559
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:33,890
these two systems, we end up with exactly the sum

560
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,480
we saw last week for the total energy that

561
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,870
combined system. For now, we will come back to

562
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,950
that sort of issue a bit later on. We'll leave it

563
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:53,160
as a sufficient result. To say that or to

564
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,280
acknowledge that the final entropies have to be no

565
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,700
smaller than the initial interviews.

566
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,530
And then.

567
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,330
Inserting.

568
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:12,120
The leading order killer expansion that we got

569
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:21,270
here. Into this inequality to squeeze onto the

570
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,750
projector while I read it.

571
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:35,670
No, that s a crime as. He did Prime. Is to bring

572
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,620
order in the energy flow.

573
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:46,110
SFP, a plus delta over T8.

574
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,920
SBB.

575
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:58,120
Similarly, Delta Ebbe over TV, and this has to be

576
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,010
greater than or equal to the initial Entropies S4

577
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:12,370
system, plus the intrepidity forces to keep, which

578
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,870
means there are some simplifications that we can.

579
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:23,240
See, with the result being.

580
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:35,310
Guilty, a 30 a. Still to be over, TV needs to be

581
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:39,930
greater than zero and that

582
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,380
conservation of energy.

583
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,920
Which is the statement, Delta

584
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:56,490
is negative, Delta in the. We can get rid of one

585
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:01,560
of the. One of these in here is People Out of

586
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:02,640
Control Factor.

587
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,490
Of Delta A.

588
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,960
Times now, the difference between the increased

589
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,240
temperature and we started off with an systemis

590
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,060
minus the increased temperature. We started off

591
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:28,000
with the System B, which is what we wanted to find.

592
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,170
So.

593
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,820
That is the. Ultimate result of the second law of

594
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:40,530
thermodynamics gives us more heat exchange between

595
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:46,330
two systems that are brought into contact. And if

596
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:50,860
we set aside for the moment the possibility that

597
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:54,760
this expression will be used in quality and we say

598
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,590
that the. Product of these two terms, the energy

599
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:03,730
flow and the difference in the temperatures has to

600
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:10,360
be positive and there are. Two main possibilities

601
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,650
in both terms are positive or negative, and the

602
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:19,090
negative sides can select if this difference in

603
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:24,250
temperatures is negative. And we need to have a

604
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,970
negative flow in energy. So what does that mean?

605
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:34,570
This factor is negative when TV is less than a

606
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,870
third of the inverse, whatever, TV is greater than

607
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:43,150
the impersonality a. Which means that when A is

608
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,190
the core system to start off with.

609
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:54,190
That is right. Sorry, B is smaller. Temperature

610
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:58,560
this to be a small body temperature in. System,

611
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:02,820
they see that the universe is inverse differences,

612
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:07,140
negative, so is the hotter system at the same time

613
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:12,120
filter a. Has to be negative, so energy is flowing

614
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,810
out of the system into the cooling system, as

615
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,380
everyone would expect. And for a natural system,

616
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:26,380
the energy so out of the water system reduces its.

617
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,400
No microstamping, this is entropy reduces its

618
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:30,990
temperature.

619
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:36,670
Which brings down the temperatures of these two

620
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:42,380
systems closer together. And the. Same thing

621
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:46,700
happens that the two factors are positive in that

622
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:52,340
case, which is largely the one over TV. So the

623
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:56,000
temperature system is initially smaller than the

624
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,540
temperature and system be. And the positive flow

625
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:03,980
in energy means the energy is flowing into the

626
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,250
system and out of the hotter system.

627
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,850
And then finally, there is the possibility that.

628
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:20,890
Both terms were one of the other term is zero. So

629
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:25,930
if the energies are equal. We have. No energy

630
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:30,520
flows in the special case, that's when the

631
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,200
temperatures were equal before we put these

632
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,930
systems in the contact, that thermal contact has

633
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:38,950
no effect, the energy to stay equal throughout it

634
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:40,930
as the systems are brought together and we

635
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:46,770
separate. So at least with respect to the natural

636
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:51,360
regime of spin systems or other generic systems,

637
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,710
then this micro canonical definition of

638
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,350
temperature, despite its weird features to look at

639
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,950
the example we went through, does behave as we

640
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:09,500
expect for your spin system and. As. As advertised,

641
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,440
we will now be shifting into the canonical

642
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:18,520
ensemble where. The temperature T.L.. Is the

643
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,330
defining fixed quantity that characterizes the

644
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:27,040
system, you avoid some of the weirdness of the

645
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,790
underlying canonical system. We'll leave that for

646
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:36,010
tomorrow morning, because I'll start with you and

647
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:38,830
just wrap up today by saying if there are any

648
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,360
questions about what we went through with the

649
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:42,720
temperature of the water column,

650
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:49,120
which paves the way it should, and in some cases,

651
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,540
at least it should.

652
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,620
I'll see you tomorrow. I almost forgot to mention

653
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,040
that this being week three of the usual week three

654
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,070
mini questionnaires online on canvas, if you want

655
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,860
to get any feedback about how things are going so

656
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:24,580
far with this model out of

657
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:27,640
is about.
