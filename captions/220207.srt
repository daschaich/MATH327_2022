1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,370
Well, I'll go ahead and get that recording started.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,830
Then get the usual attendance

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,590
monitoring issue out of the way. The number is

4
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,080
Four eight two

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,470
six eight three.

6
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,190
Welcome back to the second week of physics, are

7
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,310
there any immediate questions from the stuff we

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,140
went through in the first?

9
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,690
Well, the more times people think of any just a

10
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,970
quick recap of some of the main things with

11
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,080
hundreds of

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:04,200
civilians, the floor. And. Starting from a

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,950
foundation in probability theory, last week, we

14
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,590
developed two main results that start to show in

15
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,690
broad terms how this sort of snooty behavior that

16
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,900
we expect from everyday experience with systems

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,960
like the air in this room with lots of molecules

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,740
and atoms all bouncing around emerge from the

19
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,590
stick, has the dynamics of those underlying

20
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,650
degrees of freedom. The first of those results was

21
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,560
that of large numbers.

22
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,390
We focus on the arithmetic and we have that

23
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,090
reproduces the true meaning of life, liberty,

24
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,060
distribution, more generally,

25
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,850
the law of large numbers effectively states that.

26
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,680
Averaging over a large number of repeated

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,640
experiments.

28
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,810
Or those repeated experiments can be many

29
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,990
independent degrees of freedom. We've yet to

30
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:22,220
arrest. That's reproduces the true expectation

31
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,830
values. Seen on that large scale. And building out

32
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,600
that the central bureau.

33
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,060
Dictates that.

34
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,990
The collective behavior of those many degrees of

35
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,620
freedom is a normal distribution, so the ocean.

36
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,100
Behavior.

37
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,970
Bajrang in probability. Distribution.

38
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,670
For a large number of degrees of freedom.

39
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,050
And particularly this probability distribution

40
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:20,410
patterns. Only on. The individual.

41
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,910
Means and variances.

42
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,170
More of those on the line.

43
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,810
I should keep an eye on this issue on the screen.

44
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,540
For those underlying degrees of freedom. So we are

45
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,560
still collecting behavior is emerging from the.

46
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,130
Sarcastic or capitalistic behaviors of these

47
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,400
underlying degrees of freedom, and we saw in the

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,460
tutorial that. Looking at some type of code. This

49
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,280
is much larger than one.

50
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,690
Can. Really set in quite quickly this large scale

51
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,870
behavior described by the central limit theorem.

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,300
Even in around five gave you a good approximation,

53
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,510
for the example, we looked at their. Already.

54
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,920
So a final call for questions about those topics

55
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,520
before.

56
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,850
And another model will be blah, blah,

57
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:46,230
blah, blah. No, and this language, which Paul. Yes,

58
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,840
we call hard numbers for our purposes. That's what

59
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,440
we've seen here, basically. And again, we're in

60
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,620
this module not quite so much into the proof

61
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,810
underlying that, but we went through that quick

62
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,230
and easy operation, making assumptions of what we

63
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,380
will be interested in is the application to these

64
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,250
physical systems. And I guess that's if there are

65
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,710
any more questions as a good segue way to the next

66
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,180
physical system that is sort of on the agenda.

67
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,270
Getting back into the lecture notes here, which

68
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,700
is pushing towards an important topic known as

69
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,370
diffusion, diffuse the behavior, but looking

70
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:39,790
specifically at processes called random walks and.

71
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,130
I guess the idea behind a random walk is kind of

72
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,260
what I would tell you, have some objects and

73
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,980
individuals of Walker who randomly chooses the

74
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,570
direction or length in which to walk. Now, that

75
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,050
sounds at first glance, maybe that's.

76
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,790
Simplistic or uninteresting, the power of random

77
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,400
walks comes from the ability to model all sorts of

78
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,590
stochastic phenomena around the box, not

79
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,380
necessarily in the physical space, but possibly in

80
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,850
more abstract spaces. One example you can walk in

81
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,020
a space of energy is that a system of particles

82
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,360
can have and considering just a simple system to

83
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,510
start off with. Where? If this happens in here

84
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,960
about our processes, which then walks are an

85
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,880
example of, that's something that we will also get

86
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,640
back to somewhat later in term, we can set that

87
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,160
aside for now. Let's consider in this section just

88
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,320
sort of the simplest random walk that we can where

89
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,040
our water is moving only in only one block and is

90
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,410
moving only in steps with some fixed length. The

91
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,480
only element of randomness in this law is which

92
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,790
direction along this line the water moves. So

93
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,230
maybe the water and we'll say, what's the

94
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,160
probability that we'll take a step with a fixed

95
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,030
line to the right and with probability? One dance

96
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,970
to your cue. I'll take a step back to the left,

97
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,470
get back where I started.

98
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:43,360
So we can equivalently see that we assume that

99
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,060
each of these steps is happening one after the

100
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,300
other and sort of regular tick of the clock, so

101
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,940
the total number of steps is going to define it

102
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,590
for the length of time in which I'm walking either

103
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,430
to the left or to the right. The total length of

104
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,330
time t is just any number of steps, times that

105
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,750
caused tick of the clock for each step. So.

106
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,630
Just thinking of the random. A representative

107
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:21,130
random walk with six steps where. And then used to

108
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,960
first take a step to the left and the step to go

109
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,310
right back to where it started, another step to

110
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,860
the left and then another step to the right in

111
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,680
Afghanistan and a few more steps to the right.

112
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,650
Give me some distance, two steps to the right to

113
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,790
where I started the call that plus two. And if I

114
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,010
had done everything the other way around, would

115
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,870
have ended up two steps to the left of the

116
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,030
starting points. Call that negative to. The

117
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,290
starting point is zero, and just adding numbers to

118
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,650
the final position of the walk for each step that

119
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,220
is taken. So.

120
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,040
One of the some of the power random walks comes

121
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,110
from the combination of likability with the simple

122
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,880
mathematics in this case, there are two

123
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,060
possibilities the probabilities here that add up

124
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:21,340
to one. So. The. The probabilities that come out

125
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,170
of these random processes are. Similar in some

126
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,970
ways to the very first example of something that

127
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,560
we came up with in the first day of this term.

128
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,690
Belaboring the questions of this guy here. We know

129
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:44,720
that with an equal six steps, the total number of

130
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,070
possible locks is to that power. Six, there are

131
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,670
two possibilities, just like flipping a coin at

132
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:57,340
each of the six steps that is taken. And the

133
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,440
difference with flipping a coin is that there are

134
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:06,460
unequal probabilities potentially of going. Either

135
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,900
to the left or the right.

136
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,010
So that, first of all, I did two steps to the left

137
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,570
with four to the right would have occurred with

138
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,860
probability of the four and Q which is what, minus

139
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,990
to the two. And similarly, the Steffanie going in

140
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,680
the opposite direction at each stage would have

141
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,850
had T squared off by to the fourth, which

142
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,480
immediately generalizes one and step one with our

143
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,190
steps to the right. Probability is the power our.

144
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:53,060
Due to the power and bias, are the total number

145
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,330
just being. To the power, Ms.

146
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,120
So.

147
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,300
This is just mathematically a slight

148
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,920
generalization on the process of flipping a coin,

149
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,720
but we will see that there is a lot we can do in

150
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,740
the simple case, in particular in connection to

151
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,730
the central limit theorem. So the. Observable

152
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,010
expectation value will be interested in analyzing

153
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,120
is the final position where the walk ends after

154
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:33,150
that time t or those steps which you can recognize

155
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,480
as the same sort of song that we dealt with in

156
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,170
that let example at the end of last week, in the

157
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,360
context of this problem, you're just adding that

158
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,970
the outcomes of each of these and identical

159
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:54,760
processes. In particular, what we. What will

160
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,810
determine is the expected value for the end of the

161
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:05,190
war, as well as the the various the spread, the

162
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,240
scale of fluctuations that we can expect around

163
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:14,620
that average value at the end of the year. Water

164
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,940
taking those steps.

165
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,430
And I just wanted to mention that the expectation

166
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,960
value here and this very is I will not use.

167
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,740
Variables, variables unsuitable for those oil

168
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:39,560
reserves, those for the mean and variance of the

169
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,590
single step, that is the fundamental underlying

170
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,230
process being repeated many times to build up this

171
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,020
random this random process.

172
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:58,530
And sort of based on those definitions, it's easy

173
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:03,090
enough to write down the final position of the

174
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:07,900
walker in terms of. The number of steps that it

175
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,730
takes in total and number of the steps that go to

176
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,640
the right, we call a lowercase R to keep them from

177
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,800
being mixed up with a number of repetitions that

178
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,170
we had. Earlier in the course.

179
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:32,140
So. This break down despite opposition. Is going

180
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,830
to be. Plus, one hundred a number of steps taken

181
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:42,320
to the right. We added minus one with a number of

182
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,560
steps taken to the left, which is all of those

183
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,160
other and minus our steps out of the total

184
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,100
rearranging that. Just because two times more

185
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,800
light is an. And in particular, if we

186
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,230
just check the two examples that were in the

187
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:12,710
previous gap within. Equals six, equals four. We

188
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,580
ended up with a final position of plus two, which

189
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:22,900
is the V eight minus six and similarly for. The

190
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,900
example would be reverse on the left and right

191
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,170
steps, head to the right and forward to the left,

192
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,200
the final position after that block was minus two

193
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,500
or two steps to the left of that starting point.

194
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:44,830
So we can recast the probability as a function of

195
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,040
X for this final position, just with the

196
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,630
probability piece of ah, of taking a certain

197
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:59,930
number of steps in the right, which. That is a bit

198
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,770
of a simplification that does only hold the

199
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:08,750
special case and not in more general situations

200
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,840
where we might consider having the length of these

201
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,620
steps very.

202
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,300
So is the the set up does not necessarily pay off

203
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,700
clear at this point?

204
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,650
So let's add in the one final piece to.

205
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:39,180
Build up the probabilities of taking our steps in

206
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,410
the right that we will use to analyze the final

207
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,160
position of our land and water afterwards. OK, so

208
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,440
in addition to discounting the probability of

209
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,580
taking the particular set of sequence of steps

210
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,720
randomly chosen left and right, we need to count

211
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:04,650
up the number of different possible ways of taking

212
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,070
those steps in any given order. So.

213
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,460
Hopefully, it is obvious that the order in which

214
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,460
the steps are taken does not matter all the way up

215
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,500
to the white person and probably back will keep

216
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,360
bouncing around that starting point before going

217
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,470
the few steps out. And we know that counting

218
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:30,810
possible ways of choosing our steps to the right

219
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,640
steps total is the binomial coefficients.

220
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,920
And she was over.

221
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:47,480
Which we can expect to show up. In the full

222
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,750
probability of. In combination with the P's and

223
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,310
Q's of stepping to the left or to the right, so.

224
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,250
Going back to. This example with.

225
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:09,360
And of six and final possession packs of four.

226
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,070
How many steps to the right? Is that going to be

227
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:20,030
to end up at X equals four after six steps?

228
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,060
Five year.

229
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,110
Sort of like five steps to the right and take that

230
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,020
last one. To the left and the opposition for more

231
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,960
equivalent leave, since the order doesn't matter.

232
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,260
Could have left that single leftward step on the

233
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,820
second to last position, more in the third to last

234
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:54,180
position. More on the way at first position in the

235
00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:02,190
step seven six. So those are the six ways of.

236
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,630
Choosing the. Five steps in the right with

237
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,060
probability to the fifth single step to the left,

238
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,430
the probability cube and.

239
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:22,190
So. Right here. That is six steps we've counted

240
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,480
out here, is that in?

241
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,340
There it is on the screen for you that and she was

242
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,940
our the coefficient here to use five, which is

243
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:39,470
just six and a generalization. For the probability

244
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,900
of the step with our steps to the right and minus

245
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,560
our steps to the left, is that binomial

246
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:54,630
coefficients? And she was for. I'm probably of our

247
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,900
steps to the right of the people are in queue and

248
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,460
minus our steps to the left.

249
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,570
And at this point. With the probabilities defined

250
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,640
for all of the events in the outcome space, the

251
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,280
process of competing expectation values is

252
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,300
basically straightforward arithmetic, which.

253
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,510
To run through that reasonably quickly.

254
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:40,660
As a reminder, the expectation value for any given

255
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,290
function.

256
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:49,140
Called. Of the degrees of freedom, either step to

257
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,090
the left or right or the number of steps to the

258
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:55,140
right is the sum over all of the.

259
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,800
Possibilities in the open space will be events of

260
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,160
whatever investigations of weighted by the

261
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,450
probability of each of those events and we assign

262
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:16,570
more. So we computed that P are just off the top

263
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:21,850
of the screen there. And looking in.

264
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:30,880
The value for. X was all the way back here next

265
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,090
year, two times ah, and my list ends with some

266
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:41,130
over overall. Two times more like this than. Times

267
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,210
the probability for taking our steps to the right.

268
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:52,630
Is exactly two times this expectation value of

269
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,580
power to the power of one.

270
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,580
Minus 10 times the sum over all of those

271
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,460
probabilities, which because they are

272
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,800
probabilities, you know, just to one. So the

273
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:16,560
expectation value of X has the same form. As the

274
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,100
expression came up with the boat simply related to

275
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,870
the expectation value. Of our times to understand

276
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,010
that same relationship between the final position

277
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,580
of the war and the number of steps taken in what

278
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,210
direction?

279
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,150
So the same.

280
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,600
Amputation goes through the.

281
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:52,480
Square. The object was expectation value. You're

282
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,570
taking that from.

283
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:04,110
So here, if I expand that square, I get four times

284
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,890
the expectation value of our square.

285
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:17,080
Minus four in four and then plus. And squared with

286
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,430
the sum of the probabilities, that adds up to one.

287
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:29,400
So that is now the expression for the expectation

288
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,880
to use the powers of that final position that we

289
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,900
do in terms of the number of steps to the to the

290
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,280
right.

291
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,730
So given that the task is now the computer. These

292
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,980
quantities that we have expressed, the objects of

293
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:58,290
interest in terms of an. Easy way of doing that in

294
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:04,030
general is. From a bit of what are call generating

295
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:10,930
functions, where we introduce a parameter theta

296
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,710
that this function we define depends upon, that

297
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,480
will eventually remove by setting that is equal to

298
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,020
zero.

299
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,310
After we have the latest derivatives of this

300
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,980
generating function to the objects that we're

301
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,940
interested in, so having said that, I realize it

302
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,720
sounds a bit abstract. So the example here is

303
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,240
going to make that seem a bit more straightforward

304
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,350
that we've chosen. The dependence of dysfunction

305
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,400
on theater in such a way that the derivative with

306
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,370
respect to theater just goes through this tangible

307
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:57,880
some. Deflater. Of the better times, the

308
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,090
probability for each are. Which is a fairly simple,

309
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,690
primitive. It's more.

310
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,680
That same exponential function, the probability is

311
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,730
constant, comes along for the ride and at the end

312
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:19,300
of the day. So inflated to zero in this expression,

313
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,130
because this is some of our. Of our times, the

314
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:28,200
probability. Which is just the definition of the

315
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,370
expectation value of.

316
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,030
And that after having gone through that process,

317
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,580
we can just see that every time we take a

318
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,090
derivative of this general information with

319
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,250
respect to the data, we bring down another factor

320
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,800
with no additional effect so we can pretty much

321
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:55,250
immediately write down. The result of taking in

322
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,980
derivatives on the real. This power to the power

323
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:06,070
and that same damage factor times the cost and

324
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:11,950
probably. And then seven zero at the end. The sun

325
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:18,220
over our. Are the probability or. The expectation

326
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:27,190
value of our solar power at. So. In the case of.

327
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,380
This random walk with a six step plan, because

328
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,380
it's really the final position of the walk that

329
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:38,180
contributed to the simple number of steps in the

330
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,270
right direction. The right words direction.

331
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,190
If we plug in. The form that we had in. The

332
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:54,030
previous cap for probability of taking our steps,

333
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,590
so the interviews are one, the confessions for the

334
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,290
number of ways to take our steps have a total

335
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:08,330
probability of stepping to the right based on our

336
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,640
ability to speak to the left, to reduce the amount

337
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:17,790
of our power can actually recognize from the case

338
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,060
the reason that this cover is what it is called,

339
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,150
the coefficient. It's counting the possible terms.

340
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:35,030
Of this binomial factor they used to power at.

341
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,060
So.

342
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,440
There is the buttermilk formula that you've seen

343
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,700
before, the recently E-Plus Beach, the power and

344
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:55,280
is equal to the sum of two and of exactly the

345
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,260
binomial coefficient times in our higher power and

346
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:07,270
minus high. And here a. Includes both key to the

347
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,770
other factor in the E to the power data, to the

348
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,910
power after.

349
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:24,890
And just be is just to them so you can relate from

350
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:29,240
the definition of imputed for probability of

351
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,740
interest. We can find a generate functional

352
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,330
degenerating function is just this binomial factor

353
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:41,050
race to the top of the power number of steps being

354
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,100
taken by the small.

355
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:50,090
So far, so good. We're getting close to the end,

356
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,690
so I appreciate there are lots of steps in this

357
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,360
calculation. Let's see if.

358
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:08,620
Some nice. Results once we get through the last

359
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:13,780
few steps and get back to the central level, so

360
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,650
not knowing that to find these expectation values

361
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,050
of powers who are in this set up, we want to take

362
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:29,320
derivatives of the generating function, which we

363
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:36,610
have. Found to be this simple. Look at this

364
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:41,650
derivative is an easy one to take. It's just the

365
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,550
Powerwall.

366
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,440
So we get that same factor, not the power and

367
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,740
minus one, and then the chain rule brings in the

368
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,230
derivative of each of the theta respect to Theta

369
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,520
is that same? You can see the times people are

370
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,350
going to set it equal to zero at the end, which

371
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:11,680
has the nice simplification of setting this factor

372
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,160
that appears in generating function to the sum of

373
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,890
probabilities of going to the rightful people,

374
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:21,850
after which options which are up to one hundred

375
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:26,440
percent. So setting theta to zero, this whole

376
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,990
factor drops out to one, as does that factor. And

377
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:38,640
all that remains is in times P. So it would be

378
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,390
expectation, value of the number of steps that we

379
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,430
take to the right is the total number of steps

380
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,940
times the probability of stepping to the right,

381
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,900
which hopefully makes sense.

382
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,620
It's a bit more

383
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:04,050
work to to take additional derivatives and.

384
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,230
Take the second derivative that's operating on

385
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:15,600
this whole factory here. So the first thing we can

386
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,230
do is take the derivative of that, either the

387
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:25,210
theta factor, which is just itself. So we

388
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,590
reproduce.

389
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,000
If I read it carefully,

390
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,940
you produce exactly the first derivative as the

391
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:42,220
first half, but then there is also a hiding still

392
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:47,190
within. This final factor, so we have now two

393
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,720
powers, the minus one to down.

394
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,140
Plus, Cuba is now raised to the tower in minus two,

395
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:03,740
and there's another factor of the fate of Peter.

396
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:11,700
At the end, she said it equal to zero. Well, let's

397
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,780
set it equal to zero right now. That's at least

398
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,170
one.

399
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,620
No

400
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,860
one, so that remains.

401
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,750
Is that same MP now

402
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:36,730
added to nine? We got to

403
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,140
that factor of the that comes along for a ride as

404
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,560
a positive factor that you did, it also goes to

405
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:52,080
ones with pee and and minus one times pee in there

406
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,030
and then a bit of.

407
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,950
Manipulation. Just bring up the factor again and

408
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,400
of out front, but we have left is one for that

409
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,570
term. And then. Plus and

410
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,610
minus.

411
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:26,930
And we can recall that P plus Q equals one is that

412
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:33,590
one minus two equals Q Express that as end times P.

413
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:39,850
Multiply by the quantity in dispute again. Plus. Q

414
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,160
And that then.

415
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:50,300
Is R-squared the. The expectation value of the

416
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,950
square of the number of steps taken to the right

417
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,290
to given these probabilities, P and Q.

418
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:11,030
So. Now that we have all of the ingredients. It's

419
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,680
running down the. Relations we had earlier, the

420
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,410
expectation value for the final position was twice

421
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:22,830
the expectation value or minus. And so again. The

422
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:28,800
expectation value for. Went to men minus.

423
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,470
When should we pull out that overall factor then?

424
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,430
Incentives to be minus one child, they're just to

425
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:40,820
check

426
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:49,020
and then. So look at the variance in the final

427
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:55,040
position of the random walker. We have both. That.

428
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,830
Expectation value of X squared, which

429
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,040
is topped back with the two previous page and

430
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,650
these three terms coming in, so. Four times

431
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:20,320
R-squared. Minus four times the expectations for.

432
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,890
Plus N squared.

433
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,870
To subtract from that.

434
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,810
The square of.

435
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,790
The expectation value of X. She is going to be.

436
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:49,390
Four times expectation value per square. Minus

437
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:56,420
four in. The expectations are. Plus squared, so

438
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:01,560
that's a few of these at least cancel out what we

439
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:06,730
left. Just with four times this variance

440
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:15,650
of power between. Now plug in from above.

441
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:25,240
With the expectation value of R-squared. And

442
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,880
squared, P squared, plus thinking, Q expanding

443
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,610
that. Dr.. And then the expectation value per

444
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:42,570
R-squared. In that end, where you square, that

445
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:45,740
cancels out he's only the single term.

446
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:52,610
For each other, all those cancellations. Which is

447
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,300
why I should not.

448
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:01,880
So. These are the. Results we were going after the

449
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,480
expectation value proposition of this very simple

450
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,960
random water model, six walks the fixed length

451
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,480
either to the left or to the right to vote on the

452
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:11,840
line.

453
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,860
In the book, the expectation, value and the

454
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,010
appearance of the final position are related as

455
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,800
they should be added to the number of steps that

456
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,740
are taken or the amount of time that the law is on,

457
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,900
as well as to the probability of walking to step

458
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,590
in to the left or to provide each individual one

459
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,980
of those repeated experiments that is going on.

460
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,120
And you can see in some of the special cases that

461
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,360
if the probability of stepping to the right is 100

462
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,200
percent and every step goes to the right that he

463
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:53,020
has won, the expectation value of X is exactly an

464
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,590
after and steps and there is no variance around,

465
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,660
no fluctuations at all around that outcome. The

466
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,330
same sequence of steps is always taken with

467
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:08,100
probably one hundred percent, and if say the same

468
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,450
thing happens, we always go to the left. If P is

469
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:17,610
equal to have we get back to the experiment of

470
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,090
flipping a coin, then the expectation value.

471
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:26,800
Vanishes and zero, but the scale of fluctuations

472
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,480
around it.

473
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,310
Would people a half inch equals a half the cars

474
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,430
now that factory before was expectation of that

475
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:39,240
variance in the final positions at the start of

476
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,130
the walk after Insteps is growing. Exactly. And so,

477
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:49,110
on average, the step the walk always ends up where

478
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:52,770
it started. But because there's this random

479
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,530
fluctuations and the. Sequence of steps that can

480
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:00,710
be taken there is greater and greater probability

481
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,970
as more and more steps are taken for the war to

482
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,550
end some distance further and started once.

483
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:15,580
And that's spreading out of probability. Is no

484
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,440
more formally diffusion.

485
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,640
I. Recasting these results that we got in a

486
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,810
slightly different way, we can connect to a very

487
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,840
similar result. It's known as the law of diffusion

488
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,330
related to that. Process of fluctuations spreading

489
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:39,180
out around the expectation value that I just

490
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,000
described. So.

491
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,820
Well, before diving into that, are there any

492
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,840
questions about the waters, the arithmetic

493
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:57,360
derivations we just went through? For the final

494
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,790
results that we reached.

495
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,370
Sing, Everyone's happy, let's recast them in a

496
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:13,510
slightly different way by replacing that any

497
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:18,060
number of steps with the total time. Of the walk

498
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,530
divided by the time interval taken from each step.

499
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:28,450
What this does. If you play in that ratio to your

500
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,480
identity friend, we find that the expectation

501
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,980
value for X is directly proportional to the time

502
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,480
that the walk lasts. And this concept,

503
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:44,950
proportionality is some factor that depends on the

504
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:49,570
probabilities that we can call. A velocity

505
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,140
and drift velocity, we've chosen this name just

506
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:05,590
because the velocity tells us how far a walker. No,

507
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:11,200
it was a half hour drifts. In after time and

508
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,510
specifically that the drift velocity is just. A

509
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,460
function of.

510
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,110
The parameters of the what probabilities, number

511
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:27,390
of steps and type of takes and it's inside tells

512
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:31,560
us whether the walker is drifting on average, the

513
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:36,870
expected value to the right or the left. Based

514
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:42,270
exactly on which of those elementary steps is more

515
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:47,170
likely. And similarly, looking now, the standard

516
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:51,900
deviation of that final position. The square root

517
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:57,660
of the variance that we can plug in that same

518
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:05,000
ratio T of the Delta T for factor that appears in

519
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,950
this expression for the square root of four

520
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:13,110
identity is two Times Square Root. And Q And now

521
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:17,130
we find a standard deviation that was proportional

522
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:21,270
not to T, but to the square root of the amount of

523
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:28,860
time that this random walk persists. And this is.

524
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:36,510
The law of diffusion, the. Standard deviation of

525
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:40,260
the final position of the walk, which we can think

526
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,650
of as the scale of fluctuations in the outcomes of

527
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:46,950
repeating these walks over and over again, or

528
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,440
equivalently, you can think of it as the

529
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,930
uncertainty in that final position for any

530
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:56,390
individual. What is proportional? To the square

531
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:59,930
root of the time that passes during this process.

532
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,980
Because of the proportionality, it's called the

533
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,330
diffusion constant and the standard deviation

534
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:12,990
itself, uncertainty and may well be referred to as

535
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:18,540
infusion. So it's quantifying the scale, the.

536
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:25,820
Overall distance around expectation that we can

537
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:30,020
expect a given war to end up in this diffusive

538
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:35,400
process. And so in the calculation, we did a a

539
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:39,450
computer, a particular result for the diffusion

540
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:43,320
colistin, that is specific to a very simple case

541
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,070
we set up with a fixed step length on a line.

542
00:42:51,520 --> 00:43:00,290
And this picture here is. Illustrating. How? The

543
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:03,410
resulting probability distribution and we may not

544
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,680
get to a judge tomorrow morning is behaving as

545
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:13,680
time goes on in the case that. P and Hugh are

546
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,430
equal to a half. So this was one of the special

547
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,510
cases that we checked.

548
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:26,960
In equation 14, we saw the expectation value for

549
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:29,750
random walks of this sort of equal probability of

550
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:34,610
stepping up and the expectation value ending up at

551
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:39,940
zero. And we can see the symmetry around the zero

552
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:44,020
that not only is ending up at the starting points,

553
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:49,060
the single most likely probability. We again

554
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,310
extract probabilities from probability

555
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:54,310
distributions by integrating over an appropriate

556
00:43:54,310 --> 00:44:00,730
interval. It's also the result of. Integrating

557
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,300
even function over these probability distributions.

558
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:07,090
The interesting thing happening in this figure is

559
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:09,780
that even though the distributions are always

560
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:13,330
peaked around that starting point zero, as time

561
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,000
goes on, the probability distribution spreads out

562
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:20,800
further and further. So this line here is the

563
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,710
shortest amount of time where there's the greatest

564
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,080
probability of any starting point. But as time

565
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,920
goes on, there's more and more probability of

566
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,580
finding the water farther and farther away the

567
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:38,300
tails of these distributions. Compared to right

568
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,200
around the starting. So is this spreading out of

569
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,400
the probability that we're finding the water or

570
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:49,870
finding the outcome of this random audit process?

571
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:55,010
We can model for brainwork that. Is known as

572
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:55,630
diffusion.

573
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,020
And the.

574
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:08,180
Knowing the particular distribution cost for the

575
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:13,590
brand long process. That would be the specific

576
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:16,520
cell phone we consider we can compute the.

577
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:23,830
Probably intervals which are often no one will say

578
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:26,530
what he said, but three said, depending on the

579
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:30,490
integrated probability of finding a walker within.

580
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,290
The.

581
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,120
That region around the expectation now and the

582
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:44,530
characteristic dependence on the size. Of those

583
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:48,460
intervals, for a particular amount of probability

584
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,270
for finding the location of the water steadily

585
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:57,490
grows as the random process goes on for longer

586
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:59,850
with the square root of two.

587
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,930
So that is basically writing in words in

588
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:09,640
mathematics, the picture in this picture and

589
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,470
generalizing these next figures at the same,

590
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,620
spreading out a diffusive behavior is also

591
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:26,230
presents a non-trivial case. So it is not equal to

592
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:31,210
zero or equal to zero or one. The same behavior

593
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:36,860
happens the. If P is not equal to half that, we

594
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,920
have unequal probabilities of going to the left or

595
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,120
the right, then that drift velocity. The drift was.

596
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,330
To be minus one, at least, proportionality that

597
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:58,460
you one that is not a non-zero. So in this plot on

598
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:03,440
the left here, where he is equal to four point six

599
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,990
and there's just a slight preference for stepping

600
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:09,200
to the right compared to the left, you can see

601
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,110
that the single most likely. Final position for

602
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,360
the water at the peak of this probability

603
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:22,400
distribution instead of the. To the right, as time

604
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,120
goes on, it is clear to see that same diffusive

605
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,540
spreading out process where the probability.

606
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:36,550
Finding the water in some region around Eppy is

607
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:39,250
steadily decrease in order to say the same thing

608
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:44,320
in the other direction, the amount of distance you

609
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,900
have to look around that most likely execution

610
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,100
value in order to have a. Particular probability

611
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,970
of firewalker is steadily increasing.

612
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,180
And the same thing is happening on the right. Even

613
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,850
though it's a bit harder to see we're here,

614
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,300
there's a hybrid philosophy of taking a much

615
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,870
higher probability of stepping to the right. 99

616
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,770
percent. So it's clear to see the peak very

617
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:19,690
quickly drifting off to the right. But at the same

618
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,830
time, it is spreading out around each of those

619
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:28,930
peaks and tomorrow morning when we return, we will

620
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:32,560
look into more detail about precisely how that

621
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:37,690
spreading out around the peak. Is in play with the

622
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:40,570
drift and the peak of probability distribution

623
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,980
itself. So a lot of mathematical manipulations

624
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,330
today, hopefully.

625
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:51,620
Behavior that we are now seeing from the simple

626
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:55,490
random process, pretty straightforward. Are there

627
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:59,140
any questions before we wrap up, Dr..

628
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:06,460
I see folks shaking their heads and I just

629
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:14,240
come over there and I'll see you again tomorrow

630
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:14,750
morning.
