1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,410
Okay, good morning, we'll get underway. Welcome to

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,420
May, after the long bank

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,930
holiday weekend.   Let's see, I should have a six-digit code for this

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,990
morning somewhere in this plan.  And it is four eight,

5
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,220
two seven, nine eight.

6
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,190
Let's see what we have for this week: the final

7
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,220
homework assignment due Thursday. If there are any

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,270
questions about that, this is an opportunity to

9
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,930
bring those up.

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,860
Alternately, let's do a quick review of what we've been

11
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,710
up to since coming back from the spring break last

12
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,300
week concerning interacting systems. So the

13
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,940
third of.

14
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,760
And.

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:19,060
Our focus on. These interactive systems. Obviously

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,050
is centered on the easy model, looking at this in

17
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,530
some detail and from several perspectives,

18
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,070
different numbers of dimensions in the story, we

19
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,250
look at different structures and over this week,

20
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,820
we're looking at different ways of approximating,

21
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,890
solving and otherwise analyzing the system. And

22
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,920
maybe I should emphasize more than I have, that

23
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,240
this is not only because the easy model is very

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,910
widely useful and broadly applicable, but a lot of

25
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:56,000
these techniques and concepts are more generally

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,790
applicable to all sorts of its existence. In

27
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:04,150
particular, the question of. These transitions

28
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:09,910
that we used as motivation and looking at the easy

29
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:17,620
model. Where we eventually built up to a rigorous

30
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,680
definition of what it is, as opposed to just a

31
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,380
change in the system as it's controlled, that is

32
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,860
very. And we're leading these phase transitions to

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,330
the behavior of. So-called border branders.

34
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,410
Where?

35
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,560
The order parameter is some derivative of the free

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,780
energy, the log of the protection function at

37
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,530
ADFIS transition is either discontinuous or

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,730
exhibits a discontinuity in some derivative of

39
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,130
that order parameter with respect to some of the

40
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,920
control parameters of the system. So of the easy

41
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,980
case, we mapped out the general setting of.

42
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,810
Ordered phase that a period of low temperatures

43
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,780
with this water parameter, the easy model, this

44
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:27,320
magnetization is rigorously non-zero while at high

45
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,430
temperatures the.

46
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,730
System is in a disordered phase where the sort of

47
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,090
parameter is exactly zero at least.

48
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,120
In the thermodynamic limit, where there are

49
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,200
infinitely many degrees of freedom and to make the

50
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,820
decision here as. Advertize.

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,000
To be in order parameter, it should be a

52
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,680
derivative of the free energy or proportional to

53
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,380
that derivative and the explicit. Expression for

54
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,500
this is the derivative with respect to the

55
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,060
external magnetic field, each of the using bottle

56
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,570
of that modular partition function that gives us

57
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,210
the. The free energy, so we call it the free

58
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,960
energy, is minus T Z. This is just the negative

59
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,230
one and the derivative of that free energy. So.

60
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,020
With that all set up, the question for the easy

61
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,620
model becomes, is the magnetization or its

62
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,570
derivatives with respect to the temperature

63
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,400
discontinuous at any point between is ordered and

64
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,470
disordered phases at low at high temperature?

65
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,540
Respectively. So.

66
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,830
To look into that's getting away from the liberty

67
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,680
cases and looking at what happens between them,

68
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,920
our first strategy is to come up with an

69
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,700
approximate description of the using model.

70
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,350
This main field approximation. Is based on an

71
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:23,320
effective field. So it's effective, which is.

72
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,330
Related to the input external magnetic field, but

73
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,800
also brings in dependence on that order parameter

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,750
of Americanization with the factor of two

75
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,320
depending on the dimensions. And qualitatively.

76
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,730
This is replacing the interactive term in using

77
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:51,440
model with this external field that depends on

78
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:59,880
qualitatively the meaning of the average of. The

79
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:04,260
nearest neighbor spends for each. Degree of

80
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,810
freedom that gets incorporated into an effective

81
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,830
field, and that's the sort of way to remember that

82
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,140
minefield terminology.

83
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,370
Even back to where we wrapped up on a Friday.

84
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,810
Based on.

85
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,520
The resulting energy and petition function that

86
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,940
removes those interactions by replacing them with

87
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,160
this effective female, you will see that not only

88
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,930
is the order parameter still related to the

89
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,200
resulting free energy, the log of this new fuel

90
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,180
production function, the production function

91
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,960
itself. Depends on that order parameter, the

92
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:57,980
magnetization. So this relationship then gives us

93
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,760
a self consistency condition for the organization

94
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,600
directly considered as the. Three parameters are

95
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,800
essential in. This expression, which we can solve

96
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:16,720
to. Find out. What possible values of your

97
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,870
parameter are consistent with this Medfield

98
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,430
approximation? So that gets us back up to where we

99
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,970
were to see if there are questions about that or

100
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,550
related issues before going on to. Look at some

101
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,000
solutions to the self-consistent condition

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,920
equation 117.

103
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,010
And not hearing any locally or remotely.

104
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,880
Let's motivate a fairly straightforward if you

105
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,650
build up so mathematically elegant way of looking

106
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,020
for solutions to self-consistent the conditions of

107
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,570
this sort. One way of phrasing them is that we're

108
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,940
trying to. Find the roots of the complicated

109
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,090
hyperbolic trigonometric equation, believing the

110
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:17,550
chance of X and X itself, but at least if we are

111
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,710
only interested in the solutions, we can

112
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,830
investigate this just by putting these two

113
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:28,170
functions and seeing where they are the same. So

114
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,800
this figure at the bottom of the page here, we do

115
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,070
this for essentially the simplest possible case

116
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,140
where you fix these two dimensions. The

117
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,510
temperature, your data is one over four, so the

118
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,390
temperature itself is four, and then all of the

119
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:52,460
terms in the tank are multiply up to one. We set

120
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,740
that extreme in the field age to zero. And now

121
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,800
we're just looking for the solution when the

122
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,980
hyperbolic tangents of the magnetization equals

123
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,920
the magnetization itself, we can see from

124
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,300
inspecting this diagram that there must be at

125
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,940
least one crossing between these two continuous

126
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,420
functions, that large positive values of that

127
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,160
magnetization along the horizontal axis. It's

128
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,820
clear that the candidate approaches one as a

129
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,700
limiting value. And itself can greatly exceed one.

130
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,140
The opposite happens at negative values. The

131
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,780
magnetization. So on one side, X is larger than on

132
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,880
the other side, it's smaller and right in the

133
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,040
middle. Exactly. At. X equals zero is where we

134
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,570
have the one possible solution to the minefield

135
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,990
self-consistent condition in this zero field case

136
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,150
for temperature for. And we can recall that the

137
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,450
vanishing order parameter is associated with the

138
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,760
disorder phase, which hopefully will prove to be

139
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,440
consistent with the interpretation we want to get

140
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,930
out of this whole approximation, making the easy

141
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,540
model, not a tracking system.

142
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,540
So what we can now do, starting from the simplest

143
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,470
possible case, is turn that magnetic field back on

144
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,960
and the self-consistent since self-consistent the

145
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,470
condition and also check what happens for

146
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,740
different temperatures, which were the temperature,

147
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,550
the control parameter that we focused on last week

148
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,630
identified the two phases of the using model. And

149
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,740
just by inspecting the argument of this Tange, we

150
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,200
can see that if we have a positive value for the

151
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,590
external magnetic field, then all we would need to

152
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,330
do is shift the value of the magnetization to get

153
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,610
the same argument to the tank that we had down

154
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,980
here. So we should expect if we fix that

155
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,370
temperature of the quarter, that a non-zero

156
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,090
memorisation, particularly positive magnetization

157
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:22,790
will shift this Tange curve to the left smaller

158
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,410
values and to cancel out the positive age and vice

159
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,820
versa when it's negative. And that is exactly what

160
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,760
happens. And that is shown in this

161
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:43,250
next. So keeping of one over four and turning on

162
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:50,900
either each of two, which is this green curve or

163
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,480
each of negative two, which is the blue curve. And

164
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,630
I simply read those off by seeing the positive age

165
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:04,800
shifted to negative values. And vice versa for the

166
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,190
negative. Now, what happens to the intersections

167
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,100
in this case is that they are shifted away from

168
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:18,540
zero disordered magnetization, pick up a non-zero

169
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,380
value in each case, particularly for the positive

170
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,460
magnetic field. We come up with a positive value

171
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,930
for the order parameter, approximately four point

172
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:36,330
nine. And it's mirror image for the negative

173
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,990
magnetic field, which is pleasingly exactly what

174
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,150
we would expect when turning on an external

175
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:47,610
magnetic field or the using model. The non-zero

176
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,300
value of the magnetization that corresponds, it

177
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,790
has the same sign, the magnetic field, so it

178
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,610
corresponds to the spins in the system showing the

179
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,580
preference to align with the magnetic field so as

180
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,120
to lower the overall energy of the system. That is

181
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,680
also we identified as we ordered phase with a

182
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,740
non-zero value for the parameter.

183
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,150
So now we have one more control parameter to

184
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,980
adjust, the one we're really interested in. What

185
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,640
happens when the temperature varies in a

186
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,240
particular?

187
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,770
What happens is the temperature decreases that we

188
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:36,860
expect to. Enhance this ordering based on the

189
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,870
limited cases we consider last week,

190
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,860
going back to the right hand side of our self

191
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,860
consistency condition, a lower temperature is a

192
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,420
larger beta overall factor on everything else. And

193
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,390
the argument to the Tange. So that means that any

194
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,470
small change in the magnetization is going to be

195
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,330
enhanced by that larger beta temperature. So the

196
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,030
argument of the Tange is changing more quickly

197
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,490
with the magnetization. So we should expect to

198
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,230
change to approach its limiting values plus or

199
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,460
minus one more rapidly. The magnetization varies.

200
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,310
Obviously, I'm not putting units on horizontal

201
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:28,050
axis of maybe I should, they are kept all the same.

202
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:34,220
So by comparing. These two. Sets of solutions to

203
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,210
self consistency, condition for a.

204
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,770
Relatively high temperature to. T equals four and

205
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:51,200
now a lower temperature, half that T of two with

206
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,290
the same non-zero values for the magnetization.

207
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,430
You can see the steeper slope in the and more

208
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:03,450
rapidly as advertised, that corresponds to a

209
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:08,400
greater degree of alignment at the. Solution, the

210
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,730
single solution in the is a condition for each of

211
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,840
these fields, which is to several significant

212
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,770
figures. Plus or minus one for the organization

213
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:24,870
corresponding to the positive and negative

214
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,180
external fields, if a lower temperature enhances

215
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,680
the system's inclination to align with that

216
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,520
external field and of course, the limiting values

217
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,640
of the Tange, which is always between minus one

218
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:44,370
and one place, limits on all possible solutions of

219
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,640
that self-consistent C condition. So the

220
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:52,350
magnetization that is predicted can only ever be

221
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,050
between minus one and one, which is also

222
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,970
consistent with how we have defined that

223
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,500
magnetization back to something over all of the

224
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,890
spins in the system rather than looking at the

225
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,940
algebraic properties of. The derivatives of the

226
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,770
free energy. With respect to the control parameter.

227
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:18,650
So.

228
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,070
Those three sets of plots essentially illustrate a

229
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,000
straightforward strategy to identify solutions to

230
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,060
these sorts of self-consistent conditions and

231
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,240
questions about those before we really drive

232
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,030
through. Now to the search for a possible phase

233
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,500
transition and to check to see whether there

234
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,540
really is a divergence in romanticisation or not.

235
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,980
So now that we've seen the.

236
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,540
Basic behavior, we can go back to the.

237
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,550
Main situation that we are interested in setting

238
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,120
that external field to zero and varying the

239
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,530
temperature when we did this is where we saw the

240
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,360
two different phases high temperature disorder,

241
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,180
phase of the temperature audit phase in the easy

242
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:26,860
model in the previous section. So we'll turn off

243
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,040
that magnetic field, getting back to that

244
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:35,080
intersection at. And equals zero as a solution to

245
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,530
sell the self-consistent consistency condition and

246
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,770
then prepare three different values of the

247
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,220
temperature, two of which we've seen before, the

248
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,850
green line, that two equals four was the very

249
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,930
first case we started off with, with that single

250
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,930
self-consistent solution at identifying value of

251
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,390
the memorisation to be associated with the

252
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:03,760
disorder phase. And the lower temperature T equals

253
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,570
two and the blue line is what we were considering

254
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,960
at the presence of the magnetic field previously.

255
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,780
So now turning off that magnetic field shifts the

256
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,510
steeper blue curve back to be centered around

257
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,330
varnishing magnetization and just for symmetry

258
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:28,210
around the starting point of temperature for a

259
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,550
double double, let's look at the red curve for

260
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,930
each year of age, which even more clearly than the

261
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,200
green. True, we started off with has only the

262
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,900
single solution. At varnishing zation, so as the

263
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,870
temperature increases, you stay in the disordered

264
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:51,630
phase of. That is our interpretation of that

265
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,840
self-consistent solution, what we want to focus on.

266
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,870
Is the lower temperature case, so it is hard to

267
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,080
beat, it is a half. Well, now that we've shifted

268
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,980
the Tange back to be centered around zero, there

269
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:16,330
turn out to be three possible solutions to

270
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,150
self-consistent the condition. Three intersections

271
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,710
of the. Two curves on the spot, the dotted line,

272
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,110
that is just the magnetization itself, M equals M

273
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:31,250
and then the blue curve, that is the cash, the

274
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,630
derivative of the free energy.

275
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:44,210
So. For convenience, we'll say that these non-zero

276
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:48,260
solutions are at some. Plus and minus and knots,

277
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,500
which, as the temperature gets lowered further and

278
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,980
further in this curve, becomes deeper and deeper

279
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,760
and intersection gets closer and closer to the

280
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,570
limiting values. I'm not going to one that

281
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:08,080
correspond to the ground states of this zero fuel

282
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,690
system.

283
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,550
The question now is what to make of there being

284
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,140
three different solutions to the self-consistent

285
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:24,760
condition and what we need to do is. Take a brief

286
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:31,360
excursion outside of static equilibrium. And think

287
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,230
about what happens if we were if the system

288
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,180
happens to fluctuate away from one of these

289
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,880
self-consistent conditions, is it pushed back

290
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:44,950
toward the value of the mechanization that it is

291
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,000
very close to or is it pushed away from that value?

292
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,870
And if you just to elaborate on this handwaving,

293
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,850
discussion of pushing. We're thinking of the

294
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,960
system itself as some sort of blind process that

295
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,310
is simply attempting to satisfy its self as the

296
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,950
condition, it's trying to find values of the

297
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,810
motivations that.

298
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:19,170
Corresponds to intersections on these plots, but

299
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,460
all I can tell is whether or not the magnetization

300
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,680
is too small or too large compared to the

301
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,140
derivative of the three energy. Essentially, all

302
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:38,410
it knows is. The difference between the two sides

303
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:44,230
of that equation. And then if the magnetization is

304
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,950
too small, the system will try to raise it. If the

305
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,980
magnetization is too low, the system will try to

306
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,680
lower it and try to raise it. Trying to get back

307
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:03,040
to the. A situation where self consistency is

308
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,870
satisfied.

309
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,870
So

310
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,710
focusing on. The blue curve, the low temperature,

311
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,070
where we have these three solutions, if we look at

312
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,540
what happens right around. That's self-consistent

313
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,900
point with the magnetization varnishes, if we go

314
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,760
to some infinitesimally small positive values,

315
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:34,430
though, won't all fit on the screen. So go down.

316
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,960
Go back and forth between the port and the

317
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,020
discussion, so if we look at.

318
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,410
Just on the positive side of the zero

319
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,650
marketisation axis, you can see that the

320
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,900
magnetization, the dotted line. Is too low

321
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,210
compared to the hyperbolic catch the game that it

322
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,240
wants to be for self consistency. So as we just

323
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,610
described, the magnetization is too low. The

324
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,250
system will try to raise it to get back to its

325
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:14,050
consistency. So it will be pushed to larger values

326
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,920
of the organization, to the right of the spot

327
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,650
where, of course, once we get out there, we can

328
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,740
see that the self consistency condition turns out

329
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,950
to be even more badly violated. The magnetization

330
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,820
is still too low and it gets pushed further out of

331
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,560
the way until it reaches. The next intersection,

332
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,400
next, self-consistent points with a non-zero value

333
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,220
for the order parameter corresponding to the order

334
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,730
phase, and exactly the opposite happens for

335
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,060
infinitesimally small negative values of

336
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,410
evangelisation. And see, the position itself is

337
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,610
now too large compared to the. Hyperbolic tangent,

338
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,310
this is not enough. So the system then tries to

339
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:07,720
lower it, pushing it out to more negative values

340
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,020
all the way until it hits that negative solution

341
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:17,380
of the self-consistent condition. So any deviation

342
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,290
away from that perfect balance of vanishing

343
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:24,640
mechanization will lead the system to settle and

344
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,030
reach equilibrium or recover equilibrium.

345
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:37,220
The. And in order to face with the large non-zero

346
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,260
value of the marketization.

347
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:51,420
Maybe an alternative way of looking at this is to

348
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,000
recast this.

349
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,790
Graphical way of searching for self-consistent

350
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,060
locations to instead of plotting the hyperbolic

351
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,750
tangent and mechanization separately looking for

352
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,940
intersections Clotaire difference and look for

353
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,980
routes, look for points for that difference

354
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:17,310
vanishes. So as before, there are there's always a

355
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,320
routine self-consistent point advantage in

356
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,830
legislation and at lower temperatures, we can have

357
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:33,780
three points at zero plus or minus. No, not.

358
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,100
And now we can essentially rephrase or reiterate

359
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:45,480
that discussion of the system as a process that is

360
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,470
supposed to satisfy, we feel of consistency when

361
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,300
this difference is greater than zero, that means

362
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,810
that the legislation is too small to completely

363
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,750
cancel out the Tange. So the system will try to go

364
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:05,240
to larger values and naturalisation. Pushing off

365
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,200
to the right on the spot, so any positive value

366
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,580
for these curves corresponds to a push to drive to

367
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,580
larger volumes of liberalisation and similarly,

368
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,500
negative values of magnetization is too large to

369
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,490
be self-consistent,

370
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,470
overwhelms the tension, produces a negative, a

371
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,870
difference. So the system will push it to smaller

372
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:36,340
values. Off to the left. Looking at how these

373
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,400
three curves that we've had for three different

374
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:44,780
temperatures behave around that. Self-consistent

375
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,270
point they all have when the temperature is high,

376
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,370
these dynamics

377
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:58,070
restore that equilibrium. Any deviation from the

378
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:02,060
vanishing position will be pushed back towards the

379
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,670
vanishing magnetization from the left and right.

380
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:09,800
And the opposite happens when. The temperature

381
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,510
becomes lower around that point, advancing their

382
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,610
position is small deviation, pushed away and

383
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:21,200
enhanced until it settles down at the non-zero

384
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,690
value responded to the ordered phase. So any

385
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,040
questions about that whole argument based on self

386
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:39,620
consistency and the search for solutions to our

387
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,270
self consistency, condition for the order

388
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,820
parameter of the Beeville approximation?

389
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:53,950
The conclusion that. We're able to take away from

390
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,360
this way of looking at the system is that we are

391
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,570
at least capturing the expected high temperature

392
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,080
phases of the easy model through this, not

393
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,190
attracting the fuel approximation. And high

394
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,910
temperatures, we see some consistency, demands,

395
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,090
varnishing magnetization. Which corresponds to the

396
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:22,850
disordered phase and then lower temperatures. Lead

397
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:27,140
to a system that gets pushed to a non-zero value,

398
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,020
just as we would expect in the order to face.

399
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:38,060
And now now that we have a non interacting system

400
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,990
that still retains some information about to be

401
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,630
interactions in the using model that have been

402
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,530
wrapped up in this effective field based on the

403
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:54,170
values of this nearest neighbor, spin's we can.

404
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,760
Do a bit more than it's possible for the U.S.

405
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:05,170
model itself in general and. Search for the value

406
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:10,030
of the temperature at which this 090 is

407
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:14,770
magnetization solution becomes unstable, and these

408
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:18,920
values with the solutions to the self-consistent a

409
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,740
condition with a non zero ordered base or the

410
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:31,810
parameter appear. So. You saw about looking back

411
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:35,440
to our initial discussion here, that in order for

412
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,490
there to be three intersections, you would need to

413
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:43,590
have the hyperbolic tangent be larger than.

414
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,780
At some positive, positive value of the

415
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,080
organization, so asymptotically of our values of

416
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,670
smaller.

417
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:02,790
And at zero, if we want to have an additional

418
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,030
crossing of these two curves, in addition to the

419
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,420
zero points, we would then necessarily have to

420
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:15,120
have all the cash that has a fund that is larger

421
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:18,720
than that. This is a way of describing in words

422
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,900
what we can easily see from this plot, what

423
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,650
happens at that intersection, the derivative of

424
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:30,770
the free energy goes from being. Smaller than in

425
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:37,290
itself to be larger. So. A way of putting that now

426
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:41,870
from pictures through words and into mathematics

427
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:49,230
is that we need the slope of that tangent right at

428
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:49,710
the.

429
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,900
Solution to the is the condition at varnishing

430
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,980
magnetization to be greater than one so that the

431
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,940
cancer becomes larger than M for the positive

432
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,480
value of M.

433
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,480
So because we're looking right around this point

434
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,740
where the argument of the cash is small, right

435
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:23,970
around zero, we can go ahead and expand that Tange

436
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:31,710
as a. Serious. So the argument is.

437
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,460
This with magnetic field set to zero, is two times

438
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,700
the inverse of the times, the dimensionality times

439
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,060
order parameter. So.

440
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:52,160
This is just Exit's arguments to beat up the end,

441
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:56,630
that's approximately zero, and then. Plus, the

442
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,310
something an order. Of that magnetization, Kud. So

443
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:09,330
we won't be derivative of this with respect to the

444
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:14,170
magnetization on the horizontal axis here. And you

445
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,940
want, after taking the derivative to set the

446
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,700
position to zero, even if we had included

447
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,180
arbitrarily many higher order terms in that

448
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,290
particular expansion, they all would have had

449
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:32,120
leftover values of the magnetization that would

450
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,080
kill them off when we set them to zero. The only.

451
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:44,030
Term that remains is in this derivative is to be

452
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,240
the derivative of a linear term, reduces the

453
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,100
constant and we want that, we want to know when

454
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,460
that equals. One, which is the boundary between

455
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,510
there being only a single solution to the disorder,

456
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,970
vanishing bastardisation or all three solutions

457
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:09,100
that allow the order of things to appear so two

458
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,670
times the inverse temperature times the equals one.

459
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,610
That means simply that the temperature itself is

460
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,290
the inverse of that two times the just one over a

461
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:31,350
critical to. So we have a very simple prediction

462
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,710
from the field approximation for the critical

463
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:37,710
temperature of the using model in any number of

464
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,730
dimensions at critical temperature should just be

465
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,120
the main field. Tells us two times the

466
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,990
dimensionality.

467
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,990
Which actually is a fact to be

468
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,920
considering earlier these three lines here with

469
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:09,710
the dimensionality to. Are just T equals to D. So

470
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,140
the green line, both in the intersection and we

471
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,070
look at the difference actually corresponds to the

472
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:22,320
two dimensional critical temperature. Which is, in

473
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,280
fact, why the slope of this difference is

474
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,220
vanishing for that reason, why they're so. The

475
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:35,200
three values of the temperature were chosen with

476
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,460
some and here to be for two dimensions, the

477
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,150
critical value that half of that and double that.

478
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:49,760
And. The next question, I should say, I've been

479
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,700
calling this a critical temperature to you, Steve,

480
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,340
but I haven't actually shown that there is

481
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,100
critical behavior at this temperature critical to

482
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,090
your being, that situation we discussed with some

483
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:07,820
discontinuity or divergence in the order parameter

484
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,800
itself or the derivative of that order parameter

485
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,990
with respect to the temperature of.

486
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:23,510
So in order to search for. Discontinuities in that

487
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,790
or we need to express myself as a function of.

488
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,710
Which is going to. The possible by.

489
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,640
Getting back to the self-consistent mission that

490
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,470
we've been considering all along.

491
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:49,000
Setting. The order parameter equal to the

492
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,010
derivative of the free energy, that, in turn

493
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:56,730
depends on the order parameter. And then. We can.

494
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,210
Anticipate that.

495
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,300
Well, we are interested in looking at the critical

496
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,660
temperature to see if it is a critical temperature.

497
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:17,020
Any discontinuity or divergence of the order

498
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:22,420
parameter is going to appear at this, see? But

499
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,340
this is precisely the value where the.

500
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,640
A stable solution of the self-consistent condition

501
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,390
for any changes from a zero to a non-zero value,

502
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,500
and I mentioned this to motivate the conclusion

503
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:47,620
that for temperatures around to see. We can

504
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,310
conclude that the order perimeter itself is much

505
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,190
smaller than one, it's just when it starts to

506
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:58,210
become non-zero, depending on the temperature is

507
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,840
infinitesimally larger or smaller. So we can

508
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:05,590
expand a hyperbolic tangent again with our

509
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,220
expansion.

510
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:16,540
For small values. Of the magnetization and hear

511
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,790
here to. Keepa.

512
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,830
The. Two leading terms in order to have something

513
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:31,360
that doesn't cancel out on either side of this

514
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,520
equation. So it's up to be magnetization, Kud.

515
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:41,490
Neglecting, at least for the moment, the higher

516
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:44,070
order, fifth power of the magnetization from the

517
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,150
expansion of the Tange,

518
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:53,400
cancel out magnetization from each side of that

519
00:37:53,970 --> 00:38:05,420
equation, further plug in that to itself. Is. He

520
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,110
said, well, data is the inverse temperature, one

521
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:13,390
over 80, so can't those things out and rearranging

522
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,990
things we have. The negative one third to the left

523
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:21,270
hand side of the equation. It becomes a positive

524
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:29,250
one third and then to do is to see Peter is one of

525
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,040
the team that is killed and there is a

526
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,840
magnetization squared coming along with it. Then

527
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,660
on the other side of the equation, we have to deal

528
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:46,370
over two times, Peter, just to see over Oberti.

529
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,470
Minus the one position that we can't cancel out.

530
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:57,270
So this is simple enough to solve for that

531
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:02,100
magnetization. Then if we take the square root, we

532
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:08,840
get plus or minus solutions with. A three year

533
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,830
value of.

534
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,960
T of the T C now cubed.

535
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,770
The square root of three haves.

536
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,850
And then.

537
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,090
One half power of T, C over T minus one.

538
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:40,800
If we pull out a there's a one 1/2 there.

539
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:49,180
We can simplify this slightly by pulling out. A.

540
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:57,610
Take over tea from this factor and. Making the

541
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:02,530
argument that a large power of tea over to sea,

542
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,740
around the critical temperature that we're working

543
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,250
with to get a small value of the mechanization

544
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,310
means that this overall factor is approximately

545
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:21,860
one, you can't be neglected. So. Approximately

546
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,740
dropping that factor and keeping only the square

547
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,970
three. We have an.

548
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:36,750
Instead of the T minus one, one minus T, T, C to

549
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:43,110
the one half hour. And obviously, we want the

550
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,320
argument to the square root to be a positive

551
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,810
number to keep the organization.

552
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,380
Real and not imaginary, and that actually matches

553
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,050
up with something that I glossed over when

554
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,270
motivating small.

555
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,970
Which is that we were considering temperatures

556
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,760
that are lower than.

557
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,780
The political temperature not higher than critical

558
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,350
temperature, but still very close to it to justify

559
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:20,130
this approximation of the small magnetization. So.

560
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:26,310
With a little shortness of space in that gap, we

561
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:31,610
did. We cover the. Stated resolve here we can.

562
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:38,560
Distribute. Replace the one by taxi over taxi and

563
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,910
rate the non-zero value of the mechanization as.

564
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:50,080
This square root factor, T minus T over T to the

565
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:57,370
one half power. Which goes smoothly to zero as t

566
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,510
approaches to see.

567
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,100
So coming from.

568
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,630
Below, from the audit phase, the non-zero value of

569
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:15,480
the magnetization goes straight to zero at this to

570
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,580
see where it matches that the stable value from

571
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,550
the self-consistent condition for the disorder

572
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:24,470
phase. So for all value to the temperature at the

573
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,840
parameter in itself is continuous.

574
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:34,360
It approaches zero from the left and right, but in

575
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,260
different ways, it's always zero in the disordered

576
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,950
phase at high temperatures and vanishes like a

577
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,740
square root power of the difference in the control

578
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:48,840
parameter for lower temperatures and the order

579
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:52,270
phase. So that means that we don't have a

580
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,390
discontinuity in the order of self. So there's no

581
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:58,820
first order transition. But if we look at the

582
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,000
first derivative of this magnetization with

583
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,720
respect to the control parameter, that positive

584
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,160
one half power comes down to become a negative one

585
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,150
half power. So this. So-called susceptibility, the

586
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,420
dependence of the order parameter on the control

587
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,240
parameter in this case, the derivative of the

588
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,840
magnetization with respect to temperature does

589
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,870
indeed have a divergence. That's what we can now

590
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:35,390
identify as a true critical temperature equals two

591
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:35,720
D.

592
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:42,320
Where the political temperature is location of a

593
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,020
second order of transition, where the order

594
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,720
parameter is continuous but its derivative

595
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,650
diverges.

596
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,660
And getting back to it, we started talking about

597
00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:01,600
right at the start of today. The. Palillo,

598
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,630
dependent's of this diversion, so leaving aside

599
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,830
the constant factors

600
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:12,490
as he approaches to see the derivative of the

601
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:16,540
mechanization versus like one over the square root

602
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:24,120
of a small number. And the. Dependence on the

603
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,510
difference between the critical temperature and

604
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,940
the control for energy itself.

605
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,640
Raise to some nonentities, your power is a fairly

606
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,370
generic feature of all sorts of order phase

607
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:43,740
transitions. I should mention that B needs to be.

608
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:48,990
Now, an integer for four is typically not integer

609
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:52,650
for the order parameter itself, since if it were

610
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,460
an integer power and the derivatives would

611
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,040
eventually get it down to just.

612
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,240
That's maybe telling us that it's approaching

613
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:27,600
10:00 and should start wrapping up. But. The. This

614
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,610
power be. Turns out to be a powerful way to

615
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:38,430
categorize and classify it. Various sorts of

616
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,440
second order, various transitions, something will

617
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:47,040
come back to probably next week, not Friday, it is

618
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,100
known as the critical experience and characterizes.

619
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,900
The second order phase transition at the critical

620
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,480
temperature, the critical value of the control

621
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,140
parameter.

622
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:01,940
And.

623
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,920
There are just a few remaining comments about the

624
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:16,110
minefield fuel approximation that we'll make

625
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,570
before going into some exact solutions on Friday,

626
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:26,370
and in anticipation of that, we can compare. This

627
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:29,280
may be an approximation to some of those exact

628
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,370
solutions as a preview and see how well it works.

629
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,220
So to summarize for any number of dimensions, the.

630
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:43,320
The Medfield approximation to the easy model is

631
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,170
simple cubic lattice predicts a second order for

632
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,710
transition at a critical temperature that is two

633
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:53,190
times the twice the dimensionality. And the

634
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:57,210
critical element in every case is half the one

635
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,910
over square root dependent's there in the

636
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:04,860
derivative. In one dimension, we will solve the

637
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:08,340
using model exactly and find that there is that

638
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:13,050
new phase transition at all. That's what is

639
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:18,550
derived in his PhD thesis in the nineteen twenties,

640
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:23,740
why he thought that this model was a failed

641
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,830
attempt to describe real magnetism. But we will.

642
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:31,550
Well, the thing to note now is that in one

643
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:35,060
dimension, that Medfield approximation is not good.

644
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:41,150
It fails to predict the absence of a transition

645
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,280
that we can exactly solve for.

646
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,780
However, if things become better in higher

647
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:54,150
dimensions, so moving up from one to two, there is

648
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,660
an exact solution for the two dimensional model of

649
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,830
the square lattice. It sounds like fortius we want.

650
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,870
Be able to go through that, but we can. Just. Tell

651
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,300
you that it does feature the second order phase

652
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:16,160
transition. And it's critical temperature is a

653
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,250
little bit above two, so the critical temperature

654
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:22,730
a little bit below point five. This is something

655
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:25,670
not exactly a funny function of warmth and square

656
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:31,090
roots. We will be able to drive that through the

657
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:34,430
provision of the stability. From the exact

658
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:37,430
solution, we can also compute the critical

659
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:41,150
exponent. Of the magnetization, the two

660
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,130
dimensional case, which is one eighth so

661
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:47,210
qualitatively a meaningful approximation, is

662
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,060
giving the correct prediction that there is a

663
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:55,260
second order phase transition. But the. Critical

664
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:59,700
times, your critics is about twice the actual

665
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,750
critical temperature for compared to two point two

666
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,490
seven. And the critical exponent, which predicts

667
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,150
the wind field approximation is off by a factor of

668
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,750
four to one over eight.

669
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:18,750
However, this trend of the usual approximation,

670
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:22,050
getting more reliable in a larger number of

671
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:26,010
dimensions continues. We have to compare things

672
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,080
with numerical results for the created. They're

673
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:35,580
equal to three. But as we will in the interest of

674
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:40,740
time, put off, let's recap on Friday, there is

675
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:44,430
greater and greater agreement as the number of

676
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:47,460
dimensions increases. And there's also a way to

677
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:53,010
understand this qualitatively, that when we have a

678
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:55,380
greater number of dimensions, each of the degrees

679
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,170
of freedom in the U.S. model has a greater number

680
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:02,130
of nearest neighbors to interact with. So it feels.

681
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:08,680
A better approximation to the overall deal, that

682
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,230
would mean fewer approximations based on. And in

683
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,730
the abstract, look at the infinite number of

684
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:20,140
dimensions. We can even show that meaningful

685
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,920
approximation is, in fact, the exact solution to

686
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,370
the using model on every. Degree of freedom has an

687
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,190
infinite number of nearest neighbors, and so it

688
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:35,780
feels exactly the mean value of the overall

689
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:39,140
mechanization as a whole. So I've got a couple of

690
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,990
minutes over giving. That preview will come back

691
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:48,040
to this. On Friday and then dive into some exact

692
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:51,190
results for the easy model to wrap up this unit,

693
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:57,040
any final questions from you before we close down

694
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:57,670
for today?

695
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:04,740
Any good luck wrapping up that homework for

696
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,710
Thursday and I will then see you the following

697
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:11,320
morning at noon to 10:00, so.

698
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,740
And so

699
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:45,720
they had the ball commission is so much for this

700
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:54,560
test and she wants to look at it as the cards

701
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,170
close to zero will

702
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,710
tell you, it's.

703
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:10,090
So here the expansion is that is a good question.

704
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:15,340
So the key is that the magnetization, if they'd

705
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,330
have to see and this is time to move to and to

706
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,860
have expansion, there is a expansion for Tenge X

707
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:31,180
at large. I'm looking for some point so we can

708
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:36,490
actually go back to these guys, the chance to

709
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:42,430
purchase one at infinity. So if you try to expand

710
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:47,560
