1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:09,180
All right, we may as well get under way, with the recording

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,280
started to pick up the number for this

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,250
morning: five four

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,970
five six three two.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,010
Let's check to see if there are any questions

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,940
about the computer project due in two and a

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:36,160
half days or so, or the photon gas started

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,670
working from yesterday, and we'll now wrap up.

9
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,140
As a reminder, we went through a fair amount of

10
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,710
details about precisely what Sauternes are and how

11
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,800
they behave in terms of statistical physics

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,560
information, we need to know what are the energy

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,120
levels you photons in a finite volume and what are

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,390
the

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,920
what is the result in Connecticut, potential to be

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,670
some over all possible occupation numbers of those

17
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,770
energy levels in a particular setting, the

18
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,040
chemical potential to zero to recognize that it is

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,380
very easy to create and destroy these massless

20
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,040
particles of light as we do every day, switching

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,810
on the lights and looking first at the derived

22
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,750
quantities coming from the screen canonical

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,840
potential. We considered the energy density of the

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,620
photon gas as an integral over its frequency.

25
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,790
The frequency of the photon is related to the

26
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,660
energy of each individual photon by a factor of

27
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,720
Planck's constant each part. And the argument of

28
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,190
this is to rule over all possible frequencies of

29
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,600
the photons and the quantity known as the spectral

30
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,170
density of those photons or simply the spectrum

31
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,960
that tells us.

32
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,440
How the overall energy of the gas is related to

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,470
different ranges in the. And your frequencies that.

34
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,190
That I can cover and the ultimate result we found

35
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,440
was a quantity known as the spectrum, so we

36
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,740
constant factor with lots of piles of unit

37
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,520
conversion quantities like the speed of light C.

38
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,130
Multiplying this ratio of that frequency could

39
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,760
divide it by exponential factor of each barrel,

40
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,910
make up over temperature, so the exponential

41
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,150
growth of energy relative to the temperature. And

42
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,070
that's a tricky one, as usual, for gas as opposed.

43
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:07,960
And using the relation between the wavelength of

44
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,460
photons and their frequencies, what is the inverse

45
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,350
of other with the conversion factor of two PI

46
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,950
times the speed of light? That is set by the fact

47
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,860
that the speed of light is fixed to be the speed

48
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,370
of light. You were casting this blank spectrum

49
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:31,680
into. The form of the function of wavelength

50
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,460
rather than frequency, and that's where will pick

51
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,020
up today with. Some comments about results in the

52
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,830
form of that spectrum that we can identify from

53
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,860
just the simple change of variables that we went

54
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,340
through. The integration of this integral over

55
00:03:52,820 --> 00:04:01,690
wavelengths. As. Factor of 16 PI squared up front

56
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,140
and then dependence on one over the wavelike for

57
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:11,190
the fifth power. That multiplies the exponential

58
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,430
factor now expressed in terms. Of the wave length

59
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:21,890
to able to see Overlander then minus one. Laying

60
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,950
out the argument of that integral, which is here

61
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,530
in equation six and perhaps more interestingly.

62
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,350
Plotted in this figure, which does indeed fit on

63
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:43,140
the screen for three different temperatures, that

64
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:48,600
corresponds to the. Inverse of that data that

65
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,810
appears in the expression we derived, which is up

66
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,780
on the screen in the debate, is the temperature

67
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,880
and as. The temperature increases, we see

68
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,160
different behavior for three versions of the

69
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,290
spectrum. It's red, green and blue lines. For

70
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,870
temperatures of three thousand Kelvin, four

71
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,320
thousand Kelvin and five thousand. Kelvin, with

72
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,730
just a slight change in normalization, if you were

73
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,150
to plug an equation ninety six yards, you have to

74
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,050
divide out by the solid angle of the circle and

75
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,530
multiply by C to convert from the spectrum density

76
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,060
to what's called a spectrum radians power per unit

77
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,950
area for a solid angle. But what we can. Match up

78
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,680
with this plot compared to the equation that we

79
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,100
have

80
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,770
all, at least temporarily, zoom out enough to put

81
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,440
them both on the screen at once. We can look at

82
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,460
the two different limits first, considering the

83
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,720
limit of short wave length. So that's high energy

84
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,340
use or rapid frequency use that corresponds to the

85
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,090
ultraviolet regime of high energies that are

86
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,940
higher than the violent side of the visible

87
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,410
spectrum. And when we have the short wavelengths,

88
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,460
that one overlap is the fifth factor, the first

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,450
part of this spectrum density in the parentheses

90
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,920
becomes a very large factor. Drilling like the

91
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,900
fifth power of the inverse way of life. But at the

92
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,970
same time. The main factor that depends on this

93
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,720
exponential becomes an exponential of a very large

94
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,860
positive number as LAMDA becomes very small. Let's

95
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,580
divide it through here on the inverse relationship

96
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,690
between energy and wavelength so that minus one

97
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,320
becomes negligible. We have a one over exponential

98
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,120
suppression. Of the overall. Power spectrum, which

99
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,100
is what you see down here in these high energy

100
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,490
short wavelength limits where all of the curves

101
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,230
for any value or the temperature down to zero

102
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,830
radians zero energy exponentially quickly despite

103
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,520
the. Power of whatever land to the fire, trying to

104
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,170
push them up.

105
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,160
And the other limit's. We look at the infrared

106
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:43,120
that has long wavelengths and low energies that

107
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,510
are lower than the red side of the visible

108
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,050
spectrum.

109
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,920
What's going on there is that.

110
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:00,940
We now. No longer have much. Well. We have a

111
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,730
suppression now coming from this first term in

112
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,300
parentheses, again, that one, there were members

113
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,460
of the five that we can see as a steady decrease

114
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,660
of all of these curves going to longer wavelengths,

115
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,020
SHIRU slotted in units of micrometers. What's

116
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,100
going on in the exponential factor is interesting

117
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,470
because as this one over lambda becomes very small.

118
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,670
As that becomes large, it has the same effect as

119
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,170
making the inverse temperature very small. It is

120
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,160
the same, the temperature large. So the argument

121
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,610
of this exponential factor can become small, both

122
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:47,200
for large wavelengths or high temperatures. And

123
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,510
it's that high temperature limit that we

124
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,990
identified last week as the classical regime,

125
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,440
where this quantum prediction for gas and metals

126
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,310
Muslims should approximately match. The classical

127
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,410
prediction coming from the Maxwell government

128
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,000
statistics, which is also included on here by

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,530
prominently as this black line for that highest

130
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,250
temperature of five thousand Kelvin that matches

131
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,980
the one that is the same temperature, I should say,

132
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:24,520
as the blue curve for the black spectrum. And we

133
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,250
do indeed see that as we get out to larger

134
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,840
wavelengths, even at the level of three microns.

135
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,480
The classical prediction is approaching quite

136
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,100
rapidly the spectrum for that same temperature to

137
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,260
five thousand Kelvin, and we can even. Recover

138
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,620
that classical theory as an approximation to the

139
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:57,760
full classical. Result. So we need to do here is

140
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,390
recognize that we have the exponential of a small

141
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,300
number and just expand that exponential power

142
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,040
series. So one plus that small number plus a half

143
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,970
times a small number squared and so on, intricate

144
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,070
that difference in the first term that doesn't

145
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,740
cancel out. Zoom back in to make this. More

146
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,250
visible.

147
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,900
You work. So the factor in the denominator of the

148
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,200
spectrum becomes just the argument of the

149
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,520
exponential TCP IP that HRC Overlander and

150
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,150
plugging that in when power of the lambdas cancels

151
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,550
out with the win over Atlanta of the fifth that we

152
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,120
derived yesterday, and we end up with just the

153
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,120
temperature divided by wavelength to the fourth.

154
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,820
Has the leading order prediction from quantum

155
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,400
statistics in that. Long wavelength infrared

156
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,140
regime. Which matches the. High temperature

157
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,990
classical, this is indeed the classical prediction.

158
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,760
That's. Was found in the eighteen hundreds before

159
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:24,210
showtimes were conceived of as quantization of

160
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,920
electromagnetic radiation by the third baron

161
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,300
Raleigh. His name was Strutt, but everyone calls

162
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,020
in Raleigh for all the things that were named

163
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,680
after him and James Jeans. So this simple.

164
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,800
Spectrum eight times the temperature divided by

165
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,790
the wavelength to the fourth power was found for

166
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,750
the energy of electromagnetic radiation. Back in

167
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,170
the 90s, hundreds from sending over all possible

168
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,380
energies for each degree of freedom prior to the

169
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,920
development of quantum statistics. I should

170
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,080
mention that this form of the spectral density is

171
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,050
sometimes known as the black spectrum, the

172
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,790
historical origin of that terminology

173
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,120
comes from considering what happens if you have a

174
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,110
hot object at some given temperature t it is

175
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,440
emitting thermal radiation in the form of

176
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,330
microwaves and other leaves on the electromagnetic

177
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,350
spectrum without reflecting any of the

178
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,340
electromagnetic radiation that is in its ambient

179
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,400
environment. So when something reflects all the

180
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,450
light that shines upon it, it shows up as light to

181
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,230
our eyes, like the paper that's being projected up

182
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,010
onto the screen here where it said it absorbs all

183
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,420
of the radiation. It emits only the radiation that

184
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,480
can be attributed to the temperature that shows up

185
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:11,390
as a black hole or absence of color. So this black

186
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,110
body is a perfectly and meaning and perfectly

187
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,740
absorbing.

188
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,060
Object that's can be isolated from its environment

189
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,080
and the electromagnetic spectrum it emits. And

190
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,300
what we can see here from this classical theory,

191
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,900
maybe even easier to see in the equation than in

192
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,610
the plot, is that as we go to short wavelengths in

193
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,420
the ultraviolet, there is no longer in the

194
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,490
exponential suppression that we had from the

195
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,960
spectrum. Instead, we just have a divergence of

196
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:55,520
this energy density. And is the power of one over

197
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,840
the wavelength of the fourth. This is.

198
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,200
Something that became known after that Vallentine

199
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,870
spectrum was developed as an ultraviolent

200
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,750
catastrophe has to go to the ultraviolet. We're

201
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,860
the wavelength is short

202
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,130
light at that wavelength is carrying apparently an

203
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:25,120
infinite amount of energy away from this hot

204
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,950
radiating body. And it was in the year nineteen

205
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,970
hundred that much funk derived the spectrum that

206
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,670
now bears his name be the exponential suppression

207
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,850
in the ultraviolet that he introduced, not with

208
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,320
any idea that

209
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,600
quantum mechanics would result, but just as an act

210
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,350
of desperation, some way to cut off this infinite

211
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,920
amount of energy that was being predicted by the

212
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,350
classical statistics. We call that an act of

213
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,950
desperation and turned out, with historical

214
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,550
hindsight, to be one of the first steps towards

215
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,350
the discovery of quantum physics underlying the

216
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,470
classical physics that breaks down at low

217
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,390
temperatures in the quantum regime.

218
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,460
And one other.

219
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,830
Aspect of this figure that may be worth pointing

220
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:33,320
out is. How the. Maximum in this spectrum between

221
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,630
its ultraviolet suppression by the exponential

222
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:41,540
factor and its. Infrared suppression by the

223
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,740
wavelengths for the 4th and the polygons form in

224
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,680
between those two suppressor regimes, there is a

225
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,840
peak where the amount of energy being carried by

226
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,940
photons of a given wavelength is maximized. And as

227
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,870
the temperature increases, this peak becomes more

228
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,260
pronounced and also shifts towards higher energy

229
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,100
use to go along with that higher temperature. And

230
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,680
once we get up to the regime of several thousand

231
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,370
Kelvin. We see that this peak is located in

232
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,840
wavelengths that correspond to the visible light,

233
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,390
you can see from red to yellow school violence,

234
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:31,140
which. It's not actually a coincidence, these

235
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,200
wavelengths are that three to four hundred to

236
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:40,160
seven hundred nanometre range. So about half a

237
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:51,510
micrometer. And. It turns out that the. Solar

238
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,690
radiation is the amount of light that comes from

239
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,950
the sun to the earth. Is also peaked in this

240
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,720
visible region, which is almost methodology,

241
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,700
because having the amount of light maximized in

242
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:15,230
that region gives somewhat evolutionary motivation

243
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,790
to evolve eyes that are able to make the most use

244
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,100
of. And that particular flight where it is most

245
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,110
abundant coming from the southern.

246
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,310
There are some complications where certain

247
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:36,390
elements in the atmosphere, especially water and

248
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:43,110
carbon dioxide, but also even oxygen, can absorb.

249
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,290
Certain wavelengths of the solar radiation that

250
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,900
reaches the top of the atmosphere and doesn't

251
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:55,420
penetrate all the way down. To sea level or to the

252
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,760
surface of the earth, but even with that effect

253
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,740
that's shown in the yellow histogram here on top

254
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,490
of the red bars that measure the amount of

255
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,540
sunlight that is able to penetrate all the way to

256
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,050
the surface of the earth, that peek of sunlight in

257
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,790
the visible region, four hundred to seven hundred

258
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,090
nanometres is still present.

259
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,630
And what is interesting, comparing the Planck

260
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,640
spectrum, what's here called that black body

261
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,480
spectrum to the amount of sunlight that reaches

262
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,420
the top of the atmosphere, which was initially

263
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,560
measured by folks getting up into higher buildings

264
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:48,060
and traveling as high as they could on back in the

265
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,570
early 1970s, one hundred years ago, to measure the

266
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,120
effect of that atmospheric absorption. Nowadays,

267
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,560
it's done with satellites, experiments. If we can

268
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,700
see that this yellow histogram approximately

269
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,860
follows the pattern of the simple not interacting.

270
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,200
Black BlackBerry spectrum that we derived based on

271
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,490
the green canonical ensemble for gas and matches

272
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,130
photons.

273
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,250
And in particular, if we adjust to the temperature

274
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,940
that shows up in that spectrum, you get the best

275
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,450
fit to this data from supposing that the

276
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,350
temperature of this photon gas is a little under

277
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:37,640
six thousand Kelvin. The agreement isn't perfect,

278
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,870
which is reasonable because our derivation assumed

279
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,830
that. There were no interactions of photons with

280
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,380
anything else in the universe. They were just

281
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,860
isolated. Not isolated, but they were confined to

282
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,820
a certain volume that we have now divided out of

283
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,600
this spectrum to get the spectrum density. The

284
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:09,030
energy is divided by the volume. But even with

285
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:14,750
that. Those caveats, this fit of measured data to

286
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,910
the functional form of the spectrum. Can predict

287
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:25,020
the effective surface temperature of the sun to be

288
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,100
a little under six thousand Kelvin, which is no,

289
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,160
you will see on Wikipedia, if you look at how hot

290
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,430
the sun is, at least at the surface where these

291
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,580
photons that we see are being emitted. There is

292
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,710
some significance on dependence of the sun's

293
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,440
temperature on how deep within the sun you probe.

294
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,760
And we can carry out the same sort of procedure,

295
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,960
measuring the energy of the light that we see from

296
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:02,470
distant stars. As a function of the wavelength of

297
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,400
that light, producing a similar sort of histogram,

298
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,440
fitting it to the flat body form of the spectrum.

299
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,020
To measure the effect of surface temperatures of

300
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,440
the various distant stars, which can range from.

301
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,200
Red giants, where the rinzai we can remember is

302
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,340
the low energy and long wavelength side of the

303
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,150
losable regime that corresponds to temperatures up

304
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:37,310
to about three or four thousand Kelvin. And then

305
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,490
the other regime, the blue stars, approach the

306
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,490
high energy violet side of the political spectrum.

307
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,210
They correspond to effective surface temperatures.

308
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,920
Up to or even above ten thousand Kelvin.

309
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,870
So that is. A famous application of the blank

310
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,740
spectrum to analyze the light that is sometimes

311
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,980
causing trouble with the visibility of the screens

312
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,460
in these rooms, are there any questions about that

313
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:15,070
result before we move on to one other use of the

314
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:15,850
spectrum?

315
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,380
This is going to be. Another comparison of data

316
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,430
and this somewhat idealized modeling based on the

317
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:36,540
assumption of not interacting massive particles.

318
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,040
What we can do is use this playing spectrum to

319
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,820
determine the temperature of so-called empty space

320
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,390
located in between galaxies or even clusters of

321
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,140
galaxies where there are no stars, no gas clouds,

322
00:22:54,130 --> 00:23:00,000
no matter of any note. What there is in this

323
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,490
intergalactic space, rather than being completely

324
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:07,500
empty, they are permeated by a low temperature gas

325
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,570
of photons that is left over from the Big Bang

326
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:18,090
roughly 14 billion years ago and known as a cosmic

327
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,880
microwave background. As the name suggests, these

328
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,240
photons are at low temperatures that correspond to

329
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,620
the more wavelengths of microwave radiation. So

330
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,960
tens of centimeters in wavelength is what you saw

331
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:40,830
briefly yesterday. And let's pause for a moment to

332
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:45,540
put up an artist's impression of the scale of the

333
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:50,910
evolution of the universe, where time goes on from

334
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:58,420
left to right. And we are here at the end of the

335
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,110
universe's evolution, starting from the Big Bang

336
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:05,760
and some quick inflationary. Expansion of the

337
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,300
universe after about three hundred seventy

338
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,990
thousand years. The temperature of the universe

339
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,340
cooled sufficiently for electrons and protons to

340
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,750
form neutral atoms that changed the composition of

341
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,540
the universe from the hot plasma of electrically

342
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,730
charged particles to neutral atoms and light that

343
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,450
is able to propagate between them. And it is that

344
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,830
light that after about thirteen point eight

345
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:42,180
billion years of expansion and stretching of its

346
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,100
wavelengths has cooled down to that microwave

347
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,830
region that we can now see. So when we look back

348
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:56,520
to the intergalactic space far away, looking back

349
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:03,750
to the afterglow, if you like, of. The. Transition,

350
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,650
the recombinations, it's called, that left behind

351
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:12,420
these albums that are now occupying these

352
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:20,540
microwave frequencies. And, you know.

353
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:35,450
What? Has been done for several years in a series

354
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,330
of ever more technologically sophisticated

355
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:43,610
satellite experiments. Has been to look at the sky

356
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,940
in all possible directions and measure the

357
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,810
temperature of these photons in the direction

358
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:56,300
being looked at and what that produces are figures

359
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:01,630
like this. Which is a result taken from a

360
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,700
satellite called the Planck Satellites Satellite,

361
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,960
again, another thing named after Max Planck. And

362
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:13,690
that projects the whole night sky onto the same

363
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,040
sort of oval. You can also see for maps of the

364
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,570
surface of the world. So

365
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,930
this is a sphere being rolled into the Oval, it's

366
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:32,020
connected along all of the sides. And design, so

367
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,590
that's a different angle, corresponds to roughly

368
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,790
the same area here. Now the measurements of the

369
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,560
temperature that are attained by fitting this

370
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:48,160
cosmic microwave background energy measurements to

371
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,800
the spectrum turn out to be very uniform in all

372
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,250
directions, a temperature of about two point seven

373
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:02,260
five Kelvin. So about a thousand times lower than

374
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,220
the energies of the sun or even red giant stars.

375
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,350
And in figures like this, that average temperature

376
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:14,430
is subtracted away and what's being shown by the

377
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:17,280
different colors from blue to red are temperature

378
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,720
fluctuations. From these fights to the spectrum in.

379
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,390
Each resolvable direction. And it turns out these

380
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,750
fluctuations are very tiny and very difficult to

381
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:38,630
resolve. So the. The red colored regions are the

382
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:44,940
warmer ones that are about 20 Kelvin. I'm sorry,

383
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:50,020
20 Microtel then point. Out to Miller Kelvin,

384
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,540
hotter than the blue collar regions. So looking at

385
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,040
the average temperature of two Kelvin, that's been

386
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,190
reflected off here. The scale of fluctuations here

387
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,520
is. Suppressed by about four orders of magnitude,

388
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,160
ten thousand times smaller than the average,

389
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,360
having to resolve use for significant figures. In

390
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,700
the midst of the energy of cosmic microwave

391
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,630
background photons to the spectrum and just to

392
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:25,950
wrap up.

393
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,770
We can take a look at one such fit.

394
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,750
Here as a function of frequency rather than

395
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:41,950
wavelength, it has the similar sort of suppression,

396
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:47,800
both in the. Low frequency infrared regime. As

397
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,070
well as the high frequency ultraviolet regime,

398
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,390
this frequency is being measured in units of.

399
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,190
Ten of the 11 seconds multiply by that.

400
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:18,990
I have noted here that. Around this. Three. And 10

401
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,040
of the 11 seconds frequency corresponds to.

402
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,370
Wavelengths of light that are. Millimeter scale.

403
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,340
And they're going to be the microwave regime about

404
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:38,980
a thousand times longer wavelengths than visible

405
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:45,090
light, that's now just below the micrometer scale.

406
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:53,770
And so this is a figure from nineteen ninety. So

407
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:58,350
the first experiments known as the Cosmic

408
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:02,760
Background Explorer, or Kobad that was launched in

409
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,120
the late 80s and produced its results in the early

410
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,700
90s and has since been superseded by a local

411
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,290
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe experiments

412
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,260
and most recently, the Planck satellite that

413
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:24,710
produced. This result. This was the example of the

414
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,680
first round of cosmic microwave background

415
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:32,870
measurements and the solid line that fits the

416
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:38,630
spectrum to the data points in the boxes produces

417
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,560
a prediction for the overall temperature of the

418
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,710
cosmic microwave background in the direction being

419
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:50,630
analyzed. We've got two percent uncertainty that

420
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,780
has since been increased by a couple of orders of

421
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,520
magnitude despite those technological improvements

422
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,800
of the past 30 years. The first result did receive

423
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,800
the Nobel Prize in physics about 15 years ago in

424
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:12,840
two thousand six. Merely by showing that the

425
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,480
precision here pointed to six was just large

426
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,530
enough to resolve the fact that there were

427
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,770
anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background,

428
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:28,420
temperature at different directions in the sky

429
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,060
headed of the notes and almost forgot to mention

430
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:39,580
that it is those centrifuges that provide some of

431
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,670
the strongest evidence that we have for the

432
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:46,530
existence and characteristics of dark matter.

433
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,260
Along with some of the. Maybe more familiar.

434
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:59,050
Astrophysical observations of how galaxies rotate

435
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,390
around each other and clusters of stars rotate in

436
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:05,500
those galaxies, that there is ongoing relevance to

437
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,090
the determination of. Of.

438
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:14,160
The angle dependence of the temperature of the

439
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,070
cosmic microwave background, at least for. The

440
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:22,480
purposes of this module to the next point to take

441
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,850
away, to wrap up. This comparison with data from

442
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,660
solar radiation as well as cosmic microwave

443
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,420
background radiation is that even though you've

444
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:38,290
assumed an ideal gas of not interacting, photons

445
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,080
in the collected all sorts of possible effects.

446
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,030
That can interfere with this idealized situation

447
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,360
we still have. We still end up with an excellent

448
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,080
mathematical model for real systems from the

449
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,810
hottest to the coolest objects in the universe

450
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:06,400
from. Ten thousand Kelvin. Stars to the. Boys in

451
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:12,390
between galaxies, billions of light years away. So

452
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:17,300
I'll briefly pause with that statement to see if

453
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,390
there are any questions about. The spectrum as a

454
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,300
whole or in comparison to his experimental data.

455
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,910
And not seeing. And we can charge ahead to wrap up

456
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,960
the full equation of state for the first time. Yes.

457
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:40,560
So we've been talking a lot about. The integration

458
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,720
of the function that we have to integrate over to

459
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,320
get the energy density of this photon get us now,

460
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,590
we can actually carry out that integration and get

461
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:54,060
the energy density itself. So when the scale here.

462
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:59,490
I've written down that integration over the full

463
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,140
spectrum here in terms of the frequency. As the

464
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,710
independent variable Omega Cube divided by an

465
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:15,060
exponential factor like this one. And all we need

466
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:21,620
to do to evaluate this integral is. First, change

467
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,820
variables to.

468
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:30,570
It's been a Farmigo. Each boiling over temperature

469
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:36,100
so that. The differential factor, Dominga. It's

470
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,500
the ratio of temperature over Plank's constant

471
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,630
times, this to X.

472
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:45,350
This is a direct change of variables, so there's

473
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,920
no funny business with the limits of integration.

474
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,430
They still go from zero to infinity and we have a

475
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:57,590
causal factor of T over each bar to three powers

476
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:02,270
from the Omega Cube and the fourth power from the

477
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:02,750
Omega.

478
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:10,830
Integrating the exhumed ducks over E, the X minus

479
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:16,370
one. Which is it famous in school that we can look

480
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:23,920
up in? A way we prefer it to be famous, in part

481
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,650
because it's. It's a remarkable combination of the

482
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:32,160
remote Zyda function and the game, a function that

483
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,190
we saw related to Vectorial powers of Gamma four

484
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,470
is three factorial, which is six, and the revised

485
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,470
Zeta function for a even positive integer is

486
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:51,540
related to the power of Pi. It is high to the

487
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:57,100
fourth over ninety times six from beginning to

488
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,270
function. That's three factorial. So we pick up

489
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:05,710
from that integration. Is they part of the force

490
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:11,320
that cancels out to powers of high the denominator

491
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,820
and then.

492
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:20,040
15 in the denominator, a PI squared was canceled

493
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:24,220
and then four hours of H bar, one of which is

494
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:29,370
canceled from. The existing factor we still have

495
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:32,160
three powers is the speed of light and all four

496
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,940
powers of the temperature are unaffected.

497
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:41,920
So the overall energy density, once we integrate

498
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:45,400
over this form of the spectrum.

499
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:52,110
Just depends on the. Temperature to the fourth

500
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:56,760
power with some three factors that convert that

501
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:01,170
temperature to energy density and the power of PI

502
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:05,040
squared and 15 from the data function

503
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:07,710
and.

504
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,720
Compared to the.

505
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:21,340
Classical economic result was three halves t this.

506
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,940
T to the fourth, dependent's looks a bit more

507
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:30,990
complicated. Especially because it is an.

508
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,950
Energy density, and we have to normalize by the

509
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:45,120
oil in which we have. Can find full time gas. But

510
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,890
we can't simplify things. By considering the

511
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,120
particle number, which, as always, in the great

512
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,950
canonical ensemble is able to fluctuate,

513
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,850
especially with the vanishing chemical potential

514
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,850
that remotivated for gases of photons that are

515
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:08,980
very easy to create and absorb. And from the same

516
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,340
expression we started off with last week to derive

517
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:17,120
that energy density a derivative of. The grim

518
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,910
economic potential for the full time gas, the

519
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,090
corresponding derivative with respect to that

520
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,640
chemical potential with the negative sign, gives

521
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,300
us the average number of photons in this gas,

522
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,150
which we can also expect to depend on the

523
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,000
temperature. So this equation here.

524
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,870
Simply plugs in the expression for the great

525
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,970
economic potential, for the photographs that we

526
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:47,930
previously computed, pulling out the dependence on

527
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:52,380
the chemical potential. Now it's going to affect

528
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,580
the derivative. And then at the end, once we take

529
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,220
that derivative, we will set the chemical

530
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,430
potential equal to zero for the photon gas.

531
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,020
So.

532
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,640
It's a very similar.

533
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:16,860
Calculation compared to previous one. We're now

534
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,490
going back in this gap to the initial step of

535
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,860
taking the derivative of the potential.

536
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:30,200
So once we do that inside this integral over

537
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,340
frequencies,

538
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:41,470
we can pick up. The. Arguments of this logarithm

539
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:46,120
is the first step in the chain rule. So when

540
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:52,940
Lindsay made it to Omega, the positive. Universe

541
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,470
temperature tops chemical potential in the

542
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,350
numerator, we have that factor of Omega squared

543
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:03,410
coming to law. We have an E to the minus beta

544
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:07,390
maker coming along with the negative side and then

545
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,050
the derivative, with respect to view of each of

546
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:14,780
you, brings down a positive beta. And with that

547
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,420
same exponential factor, each debate you increase

548
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,170
temperature cancels out the temperature that your

549
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:25,820
regular science cancel out. And let me set you to

550
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:29,800
zero. We get with deal maker there.

551
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:33,890
The.

552
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:41,840
Integral from zero to infinity, squared over,

553
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,100
divided through by the exponential arc, each part

554
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:50,300
of the difficulty. Something that looks quite

555
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,560
similar to the spectrum, this with a different

556
00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:00,860
power of the frequency omega in the numerator of

557
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,630
this integral. Making the same change of variables

558
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:10,600
as before, setting the beta omega that appears to

559
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,280
be exponential to our variable X.

560
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:20,510
You pick up a similar factor of the temperature

561
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:25,220
over each bar now to the third power, two of which

562
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,820
come from Omega squared, which comes from deal.

563
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,060
And then the.

564
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,320
Famous Integral X squared over the X minus one B X,

565
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,400
that's.

566
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:45,340
Is related to the very similar combination of

567
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:49,390
Remon Zeta function and gamma function. Now, both

568
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,180
of the arguments, they're just dropped down one

569
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:57,540
power corresponding to. How x in the numerator in

570
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:02,400
this grid, so a function of three is two factorial,

571
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,530
which is two and then three months. The function

572
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:08,550
of Unit three is an irrational number. That's

573
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,530
about one point two.

574
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,430
This overall factor is about three point four,

575
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:19,220
what is best to leave the rational numbers like

576
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:26,210
zero three and PI just in their usual form. We end

577
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:31,800
up with. We have to grant giving us to. Zeta three

578
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,330
times the temperature, naturally. Few power.

579
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:44,060
Divided by a pie squared. Now we have each part

580
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:49,630
you see queued for the average time number

581
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,550
densities of the average number of photons per

582
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,950
unit volume.

583
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:00,650
The fact that this depends on. The third power of

584
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:03,770
the temperature, while the energy density depends

585
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:08,830
on the fourth power of temperature. Shows us how

586
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,570
we can simplify.

587
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:16,200
Our expression for the full time gas equation of

588
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,540
state. Despite recognizing in the overall energy.

589
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:26,480
Multiplies through by this volume, we can isolate

590
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:31,450
each of our cube cube times the volume times T

591
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:36,740
Cube with one power of T left over, we have that

592
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,490
off the screen

593
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:46,340
and that factor of our cube second with a T cube.

594
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:52,910
We can relate to PI squared at times, the average

595
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:58,820
number of photons divided by two times have three.

596
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,890
We squared over two to three, multiplied by a pie

597
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:07,220
squared over 15, gives us an overall height of the

598
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:13,870
fourth. Multiplying 30 factors of this irrational

599
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:20,030
see the function now you see the three. So we have

600
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,800
the same functional format as each of the three

601
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,990
heads and see that we had four classical addresses

602
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:33,090
in the canonical ensemble. There are just.

603
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,460
Two things that have changed that now we have to

604
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,970
consider not only the average internal energy that

605
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,820
is allowed to fluctuate, but also the average

606
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,640
number of photons that fluctuates in the grand

607
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,570
canonical example. And the overall pre- factor is

608
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,670
no longer three hands.

609
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:00,310
We were able to compute pretty easily just from

610
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:03,130
the functional form of the energy related to

611
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,060
momentum for non relativistic classical ideal

612
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,300
gases. But instead, we have this interesting part

613
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,470
of the fourth over 30 times, say the three factor,

614
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:20,700
which if we look back to the two special integrals

615
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,360
that we invoke, we can actually recognize as a

616
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:29,760
very fun ratio of camera functions and reminded of

617
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,520
ocean values. Jennifer Zyda, four, divided by a

618
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:39,180
three to three. Which turns out to be numerically

619
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,940
around two point seven percent, not quite twice as

620
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:47,370
large as the non relativistic classical factor of

621
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,450
three house.

622
00:45:56,110 --> 00:46:01,130
Now, there's not quite enough time to. Completes

623
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:05,060
the calculation of the full time gas equation of

624
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:08,480
states today. I guess that gives us a good.

625
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,410
Good tasks to start off with on Friday, just to

626
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:17,340
serve as a reminder of what is going on with time

627
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:23,080
gases. What we can. Wrap up today by recalling

628
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,070
that the equation of state is a relation between

629
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:30,010
the large scale properties of this gas, which

630
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:33,760
includes particle, no temperature and internal

631
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,210
energy, but also the pressure of the gas, which we

632
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:40,840
looked at a lot when we used classical ideal gases.

633
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,760
As the basis for developing from cycles and.

634
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:52,090
Getting work out of heat engines back in Unit five.

635
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:59,580
Now. The pressure of a full tank of gas is so

636
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:03,420
commonly known as the radiation pressure, and it

637
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,730
can sometimes be counterintuitive to think that a

638
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:09,030
gas of massless particles or gas photons that are

639
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:12,840
streaming down from the light is exerting pressure

640
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:18,670
on. The surfaces that we show you, this is just a

641
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,850
consequence of the Amanto that they are carrying

642
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:26,320
related to their energy and frequency that we've

643
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,950
already seen, and formerly the radiation pressure

644
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:34,420
is defined in the same way as ordinary pressure

645
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,350
for particles envisioned as a bunch of billiard

646
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:41,620
balls bouncing off of the services of this

647
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:46,120
container. We look at how the average internal

648
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:50,410
energy of the photon gas changes as we change the

649
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,830
volume, which is fine with the negative signs, you

650
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,730
get an increase energy to correspond to a decrease

651
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:02,080
in volume. And in this change in volume, we have

652
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,830
to make it isotropic or 80 that it keeping the

653
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:08,800
entropy of the photon gas constant.

654
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:12,310
And.

655
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:19,600
Now, looking at the time, I think we have time to

656
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,660
quickly write down the condition of constant

657
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:27,190
entropy for the full time, us a very simplified

658
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:32,620
relation that we have. For the example, when the

659
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,720
chemical potential equals zero sum, normally in

660
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,120
the great economic potential, there would be a

661
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,600
third term in this expression related to new times.

662
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,290
The average number of average particle. No. With

663
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:47,260
zero chemical potential for photons, this boils

664
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,750
down to sort of expression, you add in the

665
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:53,080
canonical example that the entropy is the

666
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:57,550
difference between the internal energy and the

667
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,370
free energy. In this case, the land of free energy.

668
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:08,070
And considering just this ratio of free energy to

669
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:13,140
temperature. But we can write down and again, make

670
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:17,410
the same change of variables to X of data for

671
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:24,980
Omega a pretty. We have yet another fun integral

672
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,840
that depends on the data function, but what

673
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,510
matters here is that this interval is just a

674
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:33,840
number and is the functional form that we care

675
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,600
about. We can see that the three factors of

676
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,560
temperature over each bar come out of the omega

677
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:45,620
omega squared, just as for the photon, no density.

678
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,930
Give us three powers of the temperature times the

679
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,800
volume, which is our condition of constant entropy.

680
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,720
And I think the good place to pick up the

681
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,510
remainder of the calculation of the equation of

682
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:03,150
state on Friday. Final questions before we break

683
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:03,980
for a few days.

684
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:15,040
And if not, then if you have the second part of

685
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,310
the computer project due in two and a half days to

686
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,260
keep you busy if you're not already done with it,

687
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:24,610
and we'll wrap up the summer time gas equation of

688
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:29,370
stage and turn our attention to fermions on Friday

689
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:36,460
some of you are able to enjoy. The nice weather

690
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,790
for the next few days, I'll see you back in the

691
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:44,280
other room Friday morning for radiation pressure.
