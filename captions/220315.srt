1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,320
Okay, that should all be in focus, so let's start

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,650
getting underway for the second half of the first

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:20,060
part of this week.  And, as usual, I have six digits for you.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:21,920
They are mostly eights today.

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:32,520
The number is eighty eight, eighty four, eighty

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:32,880
one.

7
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,480
Are there any immediate questions lingering from

8
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,000
yesterday afternoon?

9
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,770
I think we'll keep moving straight forward through this

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,960
introduction of quantum statistics so that we

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,500
can apply the grand canonical ensemble we came up

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,480
with last week to quantum gases. And just to

13
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,100
briefly recall what we got through yesterday, we

14
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,230
saw that two things have to be done to obtain

15
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,220
quantum statistics as opposed to the non quantum

16
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,020
or classical statistics that we've been working

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,670
with up until now.

18
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,610
The first of those is. Retaining discreet energy

19
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,480
levels for all the particles in the system, and it

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,570
turns out that that does not suffice to obtain

21
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,870
true quantum statistics, if we go through the

22
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,430
exercise of computing, the grand canonical

23
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,480
partition function, the fundamental object for a

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,630
canonical ensemble retaining those discrete energy

25
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,880
levels, we come up with so called Macksville

26
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,670
Boltzmann's statistics, which Maximilian Boseman

27
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,180
did a lot to develop in the eighteen hundreds well

28
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:02,100
before quantum mechanics was. On anyone's radar.

29
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,830
So the second more subtle issue that really

30
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,890
defines quantum statistics compared to classical

31
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,600
statistics is the way in which we organize and

32
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,710
account for the microstates that correspond to

33
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,070
these discrete energy levels, rather than the

34
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,890
classical approach that gave us maximum elements

35
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,700
of physics where we broke up this many particle

36
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,220
system into looking at each particle in turn into

37
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,340
something over all the possible energies that each

38
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,100
of those particles could have, and then correcting

39
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,950
for the overcounting that results when those

40
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,980
particles are indistinguishable. As they must be

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,300
in quantum mechanics, we turn things on his head

42
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,970
and looked instead at each energy level in turn

43
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,240
something over the occupation numbers. So the

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,390
number of particles that. Can occupy that energy

45
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:10,200
level and. These two approaches at argued are

46
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,380
equivalent when there is very little probability

47
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,680
of having multiple particles in the same energy

48
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,310
level. So if we have occupation numbers of only

49
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,390
zero and one with suppressed probabilities for

50
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,860
larger occupation numbers, or in other words, if

51
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,130
we have many more energy levels, then we have

52
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,400
particles to fill them in. Classical statistics

53
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,600
should be a good approximation to the true

54
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,920
behavior. And it's only when we are in the quantum

55
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,590
regime where there is a non-negotiable probability

56
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,470
of having multiple particles in the same energy

57
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:55,030
level. That. Clear differences arise and so far, I

58
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,520
appreciate I've just been telling you this result

59
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,970
in as motivation for building things up in either

60
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,790
by the end of today or Friday morning at the

61
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:09,670
latest, we will see on post facto that this is the

62
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,210
case, a regime in which classical statistics is a

63
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,300
good approximation to quantum statistics and the

64
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,210
regime in which they give different predictions.

65
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,600
So many questions having. Going through that rehab

66
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,320
to get back to our starting point for today.

67
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,830
So we are on the 15th of March and there is one

68
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:47,280
final piece of input about the world to cover in

69
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,330
the course of writing down Quantium statistics in

70
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,520
the form of actual grand canonical partition

71
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,370
functions from what we can derive and observe

72
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,080
levels of interest. And that is. A fact about

73
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,600
nature concerning the possible occupation numbers

74
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:11,270
for. The particles that exist in the world and.

75
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,320
Just to tell you again, this is not something that

76
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,900
you necessarily have. Seen before or need to

77
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,980
understand at a deep level, but a result, a proof

78
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,940
based on quantum mechanics and special relativity

79
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,950
states that. All particles in three spatial

80
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:41,500
dimensions like we live in fall into two distinct

81
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,800
classes that differ, among other things, by their

82
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,650
possible occupation numbers and therefore by the

83
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,920
quantum statistics that they realize these two

84
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,720
classes are called bosons, infirmities that are

85
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,480
named after. Physicists who were working less than

86
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,170
one hundred years ago, this statistics theorem was

87
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,910
developed. Around the nineteen twenties, nineteen

88
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,300
forty is based on empirical observations in

89
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,640
particular by this fellow Fermoy, a freelancer

90
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,850
named after a while, those are named after those.

91
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,560
And the difference between those and fermions that

92
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,290
its relevance for our work and sophistical POSIX

93
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:32,560
is that in the booth on a case? Any number of

94
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,100
identical bosun's can simultaneously occupy the

95
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,710
same energy level, so the corresponding occupation

96
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,250
numbers are any non-negative integers, we can have

97
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,610
zero particles in a given energy level. You single

98
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,770
those on that energy level to bosun's three

99
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:53,110
bosun's and so on, off to infinity. And just to

100
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,100
connect this to.

101
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,890
The physical world that we live in, we can mention

102
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,690
some examples of on that include pions in nuclear

103
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,130
physics, helium four atoms, the Higgs boson, which

104
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,170
is a bit bizarre, as it says on the tin, as well

105
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:17,870
as photons. So the quanta of light that. It will

106
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,720
be our first target for an application of the

107
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,820
green economic ensemble in the next few minutes

108
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,170
and.

109
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,660
What differs in the case of fermions is that.

110
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,970
Multiple identical fermions are forbidden to

111
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,170
occupy the same energy level, so instead of having

112
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,680
all non-negative integers, it's possible

113
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,900
occupation numbers, as we had proposed in the

114
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,080
first case, there are only two possible occupation

115
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,690
numbers for any given energy level, and those are

116
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,960
exactly zero and one. And this is something that

117
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,300
was first observed empirically in the early 90s,

118
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,020
hundreds looking at the ways that atoms and

119
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,440
electrons organize themselves in orbitals around

120
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,950
atomic nuclei. So we've come poly. So if you could

121
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,530
explain patterns in the resulting periodic table

122
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:19,270
of elements like supposing that only a single

123
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:24,310
electron maximum could be found in a quantum state.

124
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,020
And this was. Pretty quickly understood in terms

125
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,850
of accident statistics, the government can be

126
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,630
rigorously proven just a few years later and of

127
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,200
course, as this behavior is responsible for that

128
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,290
periodic table of elements, it is responsible for

129
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,300
all the chemistry, biology and us. So it is a

130
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,130
fairly important principle as things go. And as

131
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:57,170
this is, electrons are the famous example of

132
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,640
fermions. But other examples include the protons

133
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,300
and neutrons that form the nuclei of atoms that

134
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,720
those electrons are bound to, as well as more

135
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,030
exotic particles like neutrinos and even entire

136
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,140
atoms like Helium three, as opposed to Helium four.

137
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,090
Just to remind you of the difference between

138
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,180
healing three, healing for both of those have two

139
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,870
protons and two electrons, Helium three has only a

140
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,380
single neutron or helium four has two neutrons.

141
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,540
And it is exactly that difference that. I gives

142
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,050
those two types of helium, different quantum

143
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,330
statistics and therefore extremely different

144
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:44,460
behavior at in the quantum regime where. The

145
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,760
healing for kids can exhibit different phenomena

146
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,200
like those on site compared to Helium three and.

147
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,770
I appreciate it, just sort of telling you facts

148
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,950
about the universe, which may not be particularly

149
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,050
intuitive or easy to to understand. So I think we

150
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,370
have time to just motivate a little bit what's

151
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,000
going on with fermions that leads to this

152
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,520
different behavior, the requirement that no

153
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,690
multiple fermions can occupy the same energy level.

154
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,270
Is often in popular science, where some of you

155
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,660
might have seen these concepts of those kinds of

156
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,430
fermions before, they will say sort of whimsical

157
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,100
things like bosun's are friendly and like to

158
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,360
cluster together while fermions or standoffish

159
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,820
when they want to be by themselves. And that can

160
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,440
give the incorrect impression that fermions may

161
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,850
well be physically repelling each other. And that

162
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,250
is the reason why multiple fermions are not

163
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,480
occupying the same state. And that is not the case,

164
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,860
what is actually going on is the feature of

165
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,430
quantum mechanics. I'll try to tell you about this

166
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,250
qualitatively, tell a story about it rather than

167
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,740
going into the actual math and derivation. But the.

168
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,490
The setting is if we consider a system of

169
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,230
particles so governed by quantum physics and all

170
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,830
of these particles are identical and

171
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,540
indistinguishable, they can be at various

172
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,030
different energy levels. And because they are

173
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,970
indistinguishable particles, if we interchange any

174
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,000
pair of them, all of the observable properties on

175
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,880
the system have to remain unchanged. We got two

176
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,340
particles that we can't tell apart. We should be

177
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,680
able to tell whether or not we have done this.

178
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,920
The feature of quantum mechanics that is relevant

179
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,800
for the distinction between those of the fermions

180
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,900
is the fact that. All of these observables or

181
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,400
observable properties of a quantum system. Are

182
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,560
covered by the square of the quantum function that

183
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,570
really defines the system at the fundamental level.

184
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,990
So the technical terminology, this is called the

185
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,930
wavefunction for the system, and it has to be

186
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,020
squared in order to extract predictions for

187
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,070
anything observable.

188
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,080
The situation becomes sort of analogous to the

189
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,590
fact that the square root of one has two possible

190
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:30,380
values, plus or minus one, and it's similar in

191
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,680
quantum physics, in three spatial dimensions,

192
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,640
where there are two possible ways to have a

193
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,780
quantum function whose square remains unchanged

194
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,310
upon interchangeable particles. That function is

195
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,040
either completely symmetric under all of those

196
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,700
interchanges. So it remains unchanged or it is

197
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,460
completely anti symmetric. And any interchange

198
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,190
will bring in a negative side that squares to

199
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,360
unity when looking at observables. So those who

200
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,560
responded to the case in which interchanging

201
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,850
particles is symmetric fermions are that if you

202
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,860
symmetric possibility and just as in the case of

203
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,650
correcting for overcounting in classical

204
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,380
statistics, things become interesting when we

205
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,930
imagine that interchanging particles that happen

206
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,580
to be in that same energy level here, even at the

207
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,550
fundamental level of that quantum wavefunction,

208
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:34,010
there is no change in the system upon doing so. So

209
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,250
that.

210
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,350
The function itself has to be symmetric and is

211
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,650
unchanged when we interchange particles in the

212
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,650
same energy level, so it goes on a case that's

213
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,660
fine. All of these interchanges are symmetric

214
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,930
already in the Permian, in case you would require

215
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,920
a function that is simultaneously symmetric and

216
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,550
anti symmetric under indicating a pair of

217
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,580
particles. There is one such function and it is

218
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:07,550
zero, which is to say that there are

219
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,780
no quantum states.

220
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,300
That feature multiple fermions in the same energy

221
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,670
level, the function goes to zero whenever that

222
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,780
happens. So.

223
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,640
That is hopefully something a bit more memorable

224
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,730
to give some information about what's going on. If

225
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,450
you want more, there are quantum mechanics modules

226
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,500
for you to see what's going on here in more detail.

227
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,340
And why we only pick up the plus and minus one

228
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,580
rather than any complex phase, that's a feature of

229
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,030
special relativity and three dimensions and more

230
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,570
exotic behavior is possible in other dimensions.

231
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:01,920
And you just make sure that. The conclusion, the

232
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,250
take away is clear and maybe remember the quick

233
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:10,800
example we were going through yesterday with. Ways

234
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,610
of distributing to particles into five energy

235
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:18,220
levels, we saw that. When those particles are

236
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,660
indistinguishable, there are 15 possible

237
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,430
microstates, all of which are. Possible, which are

238
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,600
allowed in those on a case, and the quick question

239
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,010
is how many of those energy levels are allowed if

240
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,840
the particles are instead fermions?

241
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,340
Boscombe. Yeah, and there were five of those to

242
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,340
the 15 go to ten remaining.

243
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:07,380
So there was TEUs. Our lost. Those that remain

244
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,180
have particle numbers in zero and one and just to

245
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,770
be. Fully explicit, they take the form.

246
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,080
In the notation that we wrote down.

247
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,570
Hoopes.

248
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,930
So for.

249
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,200
And that is 10, so all accounted for the possible

250
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,580
ways of distributing these two particles in such a

251
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,720
way that there are at most one particle in each of

252
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,870
the five energy levels, that the one corresponds

253
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,170
to a single particle in the corresponding energy

254
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,440
level. Zero energy level with occupation number

255
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:19,210
zero. So now. Yes, check for questions about the.

256
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,270
Definitions of those items for me understand the

257
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,960
distinction between them. It will be in general

258
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,780
the case that. Hermione's have fewer microstates

259
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,720
than bosun's because of the microstates with

260
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,880
multiple occupancy are forbidden.

261
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,940
Not seeing any immediate questions, we will move

262
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,320
on to. Consider each of the Bozena confirming

263
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,070
other cases in turn, come up with the grand

264
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,660
canonical petition function for them and then see

265
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,390
how these differ from each other as well as from

266
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,310
the classical case. Where, of course, all of this

267
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,970
information about the quantum properties of

268
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,510
occupation numbers was not accounted for. Now, if

269
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,770
we consider the green canonical petition function

270
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,910
for a system, those boatswain's. This is called

271
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:24,320
Bose Einstein Statistics You. We are familiar with

272
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,890
Einstein already from discussions of Brownian

273
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,840
motion and the acceptance of statistical physics

274
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,290
and atoms earlier in this course, and those popped

275
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:41,190
up in the as the namesake of bosons. They were

276
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,560
working again less than one hundred years ago, so

277
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,330
gradually approaching the more modern day

278
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,870
developments in physics and the question now is,

279
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,800
given our usual definition for the grand economic

280
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,920
competition function that I have just repeated

281
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,480
here, we have to organize the some of our

282
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,820
microstates of. Our usual exponential factor and

283
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,660
involves both the temperature and chemical

284
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,010
potential, as well as the full internal energy for

285
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,770
each micro stage and the fluctuating number of

286
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,730
particles. We take that sum and we organize it by

287
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,910
considering each energy level and turn. And then.

288
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,320
Something over all of the possible occupation

289
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,520
numbers for each of those energy levels and in the

290
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,120
case of those bosun's, you just stated that the

291
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,890
possible occupation number can be any integer that

292
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,070
is not negative. So the natural numbers, including

293
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,020
zero, is what that terminology refers to and smell

294
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,050
ranging from zero one, two, three up to infinity.

295
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,020
So to start off with the simplest case of build up

296
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,760
from there, we can consider a system that has just

297
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,380
a single energy level that is not and the

298
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,490
corresponding energy of a particle in this energy

299
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,170
level is a capital E not.

300
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,050
And with a single energy level, with a fixed

301
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:24,190
energy, each microstates is given simply by the

302
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,330
number of particles that occupy that energy level,

303
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:32,060
the occupation number, in other words. And yes,

304
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,220
this gap is here in part to warn you or apologize

305
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,880
for some of the awkward notation that we have at

306
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,750
this point. So what is the total energy of. This

307
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,800
microstates Omega's alive that has an occupation

308
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,650
number and not that is the total number of

309
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,300
particles.

310
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,080
One of.

311
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:09,930
Yes, all I heard was big enough, which is. Equal

312
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:14,310
to the occupation number times, the energy of the

313
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,180
level being occupied and we say.

314
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,260
Sorry for having this location in which we have

315
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,280
the same symbol to Capital E for both the. Energy

316
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,290
corresponding to an energy level that is the

317
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,410
energy of any individual particle in the energy

318
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:44,590
level. And with the subscript I have, the total

319
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,650
energy for the micro state of mega sopi that we've

320
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,120
been working with Altarum so far, so we have to.

321
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,990
Be careful and keep in mind which capital E

322
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,910
corresponds to the energy level and which

323
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,200
corresponds to the micro stage. This is possible

324
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,660
if we go through things carefully and I will try

325
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:13,230
to be clear about that going forward. So. We have

326
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,460
the set up with a single energy level and. All of

327
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,870
the possible microstates. Are you surprised by how

328
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,650
many particles occupy that energy levels of this

329
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,300
occupation? No, and not for the energy that ranges

330
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:37,810
from zero up to infinity. They're plugging in to

331
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,120
the general expression for the great economic

332
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,810
competition function that we drive last week. We

333
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,710
have the particle number and supply for the

334
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:51,340
microstates is that occupation number and not

335
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,240
times the chemical potential. The overall energy

336
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,560
supply for the microstates is the energy of the

337
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,400
energy level and at times that number of particles.

338
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:08,800
So we can. Plug in the. Energy to the energy level

339
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,930
rather than the total microstates, and pull this

340
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:15,340
common factor of the occupation number out of the

341
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:20,610
exponential factor. Which we can recognize then as.

342
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,290
This exponential factor. The exponential of the

343
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,740
difference between the energy of this energy level,

344
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,680
minus the chemical potential divided by the

345
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,430
temperature, which is one over beta, the whole

346
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,760
exponential is then raised to the power of the

347
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,680
occupation. No. And this sum defines the geometric

348
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,660
series, one over one minus X is equal to one plus

349
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,320
X plus X squared and so on. So we can.

350
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,610
Essentially carry out the same analytically and

351
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:03,080
end up with just the fraction of one over one

352
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,690
minus the exponential factor of the energy in

353
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,680
minus chemical potential. That quantity divided by

354
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,950
the temperature.

355
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,530
And some of you are frowning because you may

356
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:23,810
recall that the geometric series only converges in

357
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:29,960
a limited range of X, so identifying this X as an

358
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,550
exponential factor in order to have a convergence,

359
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,850
non-competition function for the simple system

360
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,570
with a single energy level, we have to require

361
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,130
that this exponential factor be smaller than one

362
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,020
in magnitude. You can actually see that as an

363
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:56,120
exponential. It is always going to be positive. So

364
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,060
it is between zero and one and four natural

365
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:05,990
systems where data is positive. We also want the

366
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,530
overall exponent of the argument of the

367
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:17,010
exponential to be a. Negative number overall. But

368
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,920
only we can take the blood of both sides of this

369
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:25,020
inequality to see that negative data times.

370
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,050
Well.

371
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,490
That difference, in my view, is to be less than

372
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,610
zero. Well, the point about the negative side is

373
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,650
that both of these factors, when multiplied

374
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,500
together, have to be greater than zero with beta

375
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,300
being created in zero for a natural system with

376
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,550
the possible temperature. That requires that the

377
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,850
other factor in the parentheses also means to be

378
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,270
positive. In other words, the chemical potential

379
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,230
has to be less than the energy in this energy

380
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:06,500
level that we argued yesterday can be shifted to

381
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,310
be a non negative real number without loss of

382
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:15,310
generality. So this will this constraint for the

383
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:20,140
conversions of the Bose Einstein grand canonical

384
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,770
partition function is consistent with the

385
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,940
generically negative chemical potentials that we

386
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,040
discussed when formulating the grand canonical

387
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,280
ensemble. And we'll just have to keep in mind that

388
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,200
the protection function itself, even for the

389
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,370
simple case of a single energy level, is only

390
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,650
defined in this regime

391
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,500
where the chemical potential is less than the

392
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,560
energy of the energy level.

393
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,510
So I'll charge forward now with the generalization

394
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,570
of that geometric series in the case of multiple

395
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:10,950
energy levels. We get labeled by the subscript

396
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,250
Heilbrunn, ranging from zero to some countable

397
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,370
upper limit so that we can take to infinity if we

398
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:24,210
are so inclined. And. Thanks to still considering

399
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,420
only ideal systems, if not interacting particles,

400
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,520
it is pretty trivial to write down the total.

401
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:37,930
Energy and particle phone number for.

402
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:45,810
Any given micro state defined by the occupation

403
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,770
numbers for all plus one of these energy levels.

404
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,850
So this is, again, where we see some suboptimal

405
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,590
mutation that.

406
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,900
For a particular microstates, we have a total

407
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,770
internal energy supply, antiparticle number and

408
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:10,840
supply. The state is defined by the occupation

409
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,430
numbers for all of the energy levels that we have

410
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,760
and the total number of particles is just the sum

411
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,330
over how many particles are in each of those

412
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,870
energy levels. So the sum over the occupation

413
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:31,750
numbers. The total energy we also need to account

414
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,410
for the energy carried by each of those particles

415
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,720
in each energy level. So we have some overall plus

416
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,530
one energy levels. Of the corresponding energy for

417
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,430
each particle in the energy levels of Izabel,

418
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:55,040
which differs from Sevi. Multiplied by the

419
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,590
occupation number, the total number of particles

420
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,590
and the corresponding energy level.

421
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,650
And the next line we just plug. These two

422
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:15,510
expressions into the general result for. The

423
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:18,620
granting of legal protection function, the minus

424
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:24,490
beta times used by my minus of principly. There it

425
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:30,240
is on the screen. We have Solms over él for both

426
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,020
survive and survive. There's a common factor of

427
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,540
the occupation number for each generation level

428
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:41,790
that we could again pull out of both the energy

429
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:45,240
and particle, no terms in the economical

430
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,890
protection function. And then. For the energy term,

431
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,900
we also bring in the.

432
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,490
Value of the energy for his energy level,

433
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,130
something within the sum over all of those energy

434
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:05,240
levels with that overall factor of beer and then.

435
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,810
Out front, the sum of a microstates turns into a

436
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:15,980
sum over all possible. Occupation numbers for all

437
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,610
of these plus one energy level, so the occupation

438
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,220
number for the zeroth energy level similar to the

439
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,790
one we considered isolation previously ranging

440
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,250
from zero to infinity. Similarly for the

441
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:33,350
occupation number of the first excited energy

442
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:38,150
level. And so one zero to infinity and then sums

443
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:43,040
over all of those and said L up to the maximum

444
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,580
value.

445
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,730
Now, pulling out the summit, the exponential and

446
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:54,800
converting that to a product, the usual rules for

447
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,300
manipulating the exponential function. You can

448
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,050
write things.

449
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,630
In terms of this product over electoral initial

450
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,890
factors rather than exponential of a sum of the

451
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:15,820
terms. And then rearrange.

452
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,800
The terms in the songs to distribute the terms

453
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:28,540
that depend on not. To be summoned over and not

454
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:34,650
separately, this is. Thanks to that non

455
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:38,220
interactive nature of the particles, some of the

456
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:42,350
lead pull out the terms that depend on a one to a

457
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,750
separate cell and one in all the way through all

458
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:51,380
of these factors and in each case. We have a

459
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,810
requirement that the chemical potential be less

460
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:58,850
than the corresponding energy value in this energy

461
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,730
level, which allows each of these L'il plus one

462
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,170
factors to be converted to that one over one by

463
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:10,010
this ex through the geometric series. So we end up

464
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:10,790
with some.

465
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,230
Overall energy, we end up with the product overall

466
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:22,060
energy levels. Of. One over one month, exponential

467
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:27,160
factors where the exponential depends still on the

468
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,960
value of the energy in that energy level. So

469
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,990
looking back to

470
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,960
the previous page, when we had just a single

471
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,830
energy level, we had just a single factor of the

472
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,250
geometric series, one over one minus our

473
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,910
exponential factor. Generalizing to multiple

474
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:55,030
energy levels just requires generalizing that

475
00:32:55,030 --> 00:33:02,410
result to involve the product of. Similar, though

476
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,710
not identical, factors that depend on the energies

477
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,090
of each level. But have the same form of one over

478
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:16,550
this quantity, one minus the exponential, so the

479
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:20,240
structure as a product of independent

480
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,930
contributions for each energy level is. A little

481
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:29,830
reminiscent of the classical approach where we

482
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,330
were able to identify and particle canonical

483
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,480
protection functions as the product of any single

484
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,680
particle non-competition functions up to issues of

485
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,320
overcounting in the case of indistinguishable

486
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,530
particles. Which become challenging to deal with

487
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:53,190
when there may be multiple occupancy for

488
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,020
individual energy levels. I want to highlight here

489
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,160
is.

490
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,710
That this sort of behavior is purely general, at

491
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,320
least of ideal systems, general enough that it has

492
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,520
a technical term, we say that the calculation

493
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:21,180
factor rises into a product over. The much simpler

494
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:26,570
calculation for a single. Incidents, either a

495
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,690
single particle in the classical case or a single

496
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,360
energy level in the quantum case and thanks to

497
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,170
this factorization, the full result in this case

498
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:40,150
for the economical partition function. Can build

499
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:46,660
up on the basis of much easier. Computations for

500
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,120
that single energy level that we started off with.

501
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,600
And I mentioned that this is fairly generic and

502
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,710
not interacting case, we actually could have

503
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,470
identified this already yesterday. We're looking

504
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,440
at classical Mexico Huelsman statistics, I'll

505
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:10,000
remind you. In this equation, 87, that the.

506
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,090
Economic competition function for classical next

507
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:20,360
for both six was the exponential of a sum over

508
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,390
exponential that depend on the energy level. So

509
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:26,390
doing the same manipulation of bringing that some

510
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,680
out into the form of a product over these

511
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,390
exponential gives a more explicitly factories form

512
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:40,640
for this classical partition function. Now we have

513
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,430
a product over energy levels of the exponential of

514
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:49,910
the exponential. That depends on the difference

515
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:53,060
between the energy of the level and the chemical

516
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,630
potential.

517
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,380
So.

518
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,260
This is a brief look ahead in a few weeks,

519
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,840
possibly even before the term rape will start to

520
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,310
look at not ideal systems in which interactions

521
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:14,800
between. The different particles can modify the

522
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,260
energy of a given micro state or energy level,

523
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,210
which. We can now appreciate the reason why. The

524
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,490
calculations become vastly more difficult in that

525
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,130
case, because we can no longer bring up the end

526
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,660
particle computation can no longer factories that.

527
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:39,950
Into a simple product of calculations out there

528
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,750
for single particles or single energy levels.

529
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,700
So Paul is here to see if there are questions

530
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,870
about factorization or about the result that we

531
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:57,610
have in equation eighty six for those statistics,

532
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,490
the grand economic competition function, that is

533
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:04,900
the basis for all predictions of systems of

534
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,550
bosun's.

535
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:15,930
And not seeing any. In the room, or mostly you can.

536
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:20,060
We have plenty of time to do the same procedure

537
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,190
for the case of fermions precisely because it is

538
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,130
effectively the same procedure.

539
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,670
And the. The result that we will get in this case

540
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:38,690
for the consciousness is that fermions is also

541
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:42,680
named after Fairmead, along with the English

542
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:49,880
physicist Paul Dirac. Come on. It was working.

543
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,090
They were all working around the middle of the

544
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,040
20th century.

545
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,270
So.

546
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:03,820
We again take the same approach of considering

547
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:08,170
just first a single particular energy level, that

548
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:13,260
same. Ease of knots with energy, not an occupation

549
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:18,240
number and not the only difference with respect to

550
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:24,900
the physics of on is that the possible occupation

551
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,980
numbers now no longer run over all non-negative

552
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,990
integers, but can only be zero or one thinks that

553
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:38,360
the exclusion principle, the. The fact that

554
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:42,560
multiple fermions are forbidden from occupying the

555
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,400
same energy level. And OK, with only two terms of

556
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,290
disarm, we don't get anything from writing it as a

557
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,360
song, you might as well just write out those two

558
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,930
terms. When the occupation number for this single

559
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,220
energy level is zero, this exponential factor is

560
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,570
just one. And the other term corresponds to single

561
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:10,500
occupancy, occupation, number of one that we pick

562
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,830
up that exponential factor and not set to one.

563
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,160
And during the. Same approach of plugging in. My

564
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,690
energies and particle numbers for systems of

565
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,670
multiple energy levels.

566
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:31,780
We have.

567
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:40,290
The exponential factor of this sum over the total

568
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,770
microwave energy use of L.A. Times and Zippel,

569
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,800
something over all of the energy levels, just as

570
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,580
we had before, and the. Particle numbers come from

571
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,610
a similar sum just over the occupation numbers

572
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:59,480
themselves. So this is. Very nearly the same

573
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,760
expression that we had for those Einstein

574
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,880
statistics. Again, the only change is the upper

575
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,940
limits observation of each of these. Now, one

576
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,550
comes over occupation numbers that no longer go

577
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:14,940
from zero to infinity, but instead in each case

578
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:20,300
and at one. So breaking up the.

579
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,650
Some of exponential is into the product of the

580
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:30,830
different terms for each of these different

581
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,530
occupation numbers, for the helpless one,

582
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:39,640
different energy levels. You see the same sort of

583
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,630
factorization.

584
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:48,360
We're now the factor that is being multiplied by

585
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,810
its that is being multiplied for each of these

586
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,650
different energy levels, ranging from zero up to L

587
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,580
with a different value for the energy. And the

588
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:05,130
level is just this these two terms, one plus the

589
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,950
exponential factor that depends on the difference

590
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,250
between the energy and chemical potential. So one

591
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:16,050
big change here coming from the different range of

592
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,890
summation is that we don't have to worry at all

593
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:23,640
about conversions for not applying energy network

594
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,550
series identities or just multiplying a bunch of

595
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:31,440
factors together. So in fairly direct statistics,

596
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,730
there is no constraint on the possible arguments

597
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,700
of this exponential factor, the way that there

598
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:43,980
were in the the Bose Einstein case. And also, if

599
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:47,400
we look back to classical Mexico statistics, we

600
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,610
also did not have to worry about the convergence

601
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:54,540
of these storms in that case. So both track and.

602
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,220
Classical bultman statistics can handle. Any

603
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,940
relation between the chemical potential and the

604
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,280
enemies of a given level?

605
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:16,720
And we are. Almost in the position to analyze

606
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,280
quantum gases that consist of either bosun's or

607
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,720
fermions, looking at the. Interviews, energy use,

608
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,600
particle numbers and eventually the equation of

609
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:35,070
states. But before we get into that. I promise to.

610
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,530
Justified, post hoc, some of the claims that I

611
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:44,250
made to motivate the different approach of quantum

612
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:48,210
physics compared to classical statistics, if we

613
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:53,440
can do, is by figuring out and analyzing the

614
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,810
so-called classical limits where. We expect I have

615
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:04,530
claimed that. The classical natural bowsman grand

616
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,980
canonical competition function can remain an

617
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,000
excellent approximation to quantum statistics. We

618
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,450
can. Imagine if we've done everything right, that

619
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,880
this should be the case, reflecting the fact that

620
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,540
physicists were working for decades or even

621
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,980
centuries without any hint that the universe was

622
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,950
governed by quantum mechanics. So in the

623
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:33,150
accessible. Domains of experiments that could be

624
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:37,320
done up until the 20th century, classical physics

625
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:40,140
was indeed an excellent approximation to the true

626
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,180
underlying quantum nature of reality.

627
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,660
So you want to figure out where this classical

628
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,290
limits should be or where the quantum physics

629
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,200
effectively reduces to the classical analysis that

630
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:04,070
we started off with? To see that all of these.

631
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,790
Of the claims that we have made are

632
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:08,840
self-consistent.

633
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:16,310
Well, the way to proceed is to turn that question

634
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:19,820
on its head and ask not where do we expect all of

635
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,360
these different economic competition functions to

636
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:28,190
produce the same results, but instead to ask where?

637
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,350
We expect them to differ, we would expect quantum

638
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:37,420
statistics to be needed. So that is in the case

639
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,210
where. There were over accounting problems in the

640
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:46,250
classical approach that corresponded to. Having

641
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,790
non negligible probabilities for multiple articles

642
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:54,020
occupying the same energy level, and this actually

643
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:54,950
connects to

644
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:00,530
something that we considered back in our

645
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:04,460
development of economical ensemble, as well as in

646
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:08,030
that first homework assignment where we looked at

647
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,930
classical spin systems, keeping these keeping

648
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,920
their energy levels discreet and considering in

649
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,980
particular the low and high temperature limits of

650
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:25,540
those classical systems. And the. Probabilities

651
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:30,610
that. The system may find itself in any given

652
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:33,640
state, and in particular the probability that it

653
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,570
may find itself in its lowest energy state, the

654
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:41,410
crown stage compared to. Energy states with higher

655
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:47,150
energies, so we saw. In class and at low

656
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:51,110
temperatures, predictions for years, like the

657
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:53,450
average energy and acknowledgeable approach as

658
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:57,350
well as the entropy, were dominated by those

659
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:01,160
ground states, the microstates with the lowest

660
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:05,960
possible energies. And microstates to the higher

661
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:11,540
energy levels were exponentially suppressed, which.

662
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,940
In the grand political context, we can interpret

663
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:19,460
as exponentially small probabilities for the

664
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,000
particles to occupy any of those higher energy

665
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,350
states or any of the energy levels with larger

666
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,470
energies. Or to put that another way, in that low

667
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:39,200
temperature regime. All of the particles want to

668
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:42,080
fall into the lowest energy level that is

669
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,410
available to them, to the ground state, which

670
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:49,100
effectively guarantees that this ground state will

671
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:54,440
have multiple occupancy. And the overcounting

672
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,650
corrections that we did in the classical case and

673
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:01,310
the resulting classical physics will break down as

674
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:04,850
a consequence. So the conclusion of this argument

675
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,430
based on work we did last month, is that the low

676
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:15,220
temperature. Should be a regime in which we expect

677
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,850
quantum and classical statistics to differ,

678
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:23,560
whereas in contrast, it is at high temperatures.

679
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:27,740
That we should expect both the quantum and

680
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:31,850
classical calculations to produce very similar

681
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,010
results, which is what we've been calling the

682
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:40,290
classical limits. I've got some statistics. And I

683
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:45,480
appreciate that the arguments I just went through

684
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,500
to motivate considering the high temperature

685
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,690
regime of quantum statistics as to the place where

686
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:57,900
that quantum statistics should look effectively,

687
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:02,610
classical is fairly qualitative and an handwaving.

688
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:09,120
If you want something a bit more detailed and

689
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,960
concrete, there is a derivation that can be done

690
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,470
based on considering the different wavelength and

691
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,510
the context of the equation of state. That's in

692
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:23,230
one of the sets of lecture notes referenced as a

693
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:26,910
further reading on page five. I see that time is

694
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:33,070
just about up for today. So. We will wrap up the

695
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:37,600
demonstration that high temperatures correspond to

696
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,300
the classical events on Friday. And just to

697
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:45,930
briefly look forward to that, the. Next up, we

698
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:48,930
will take on Friday is to consider the Grand Canal,

699
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:52,080
the collapse of oil at high temperatures. In the

700
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,900
case of all three of the different types of

701
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,300
statistics that we've been considering, the

702
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:01,680
classical Marc Saltzman case and the two possible

703
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,990
quantum statistics, that's.

704
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:10,710
Correspond to either exotic particles, supposing

705
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:13,010
science statistics or thermionic particles that

706
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:16,110
interact sophisticated, and we will hope to see

707
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,340
that they all agree in that classical limit. We

708
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:25,320
will have to be very careful in order to reach

709
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,940
that conclusion just due to some use in working

710
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,580
with the grand canonical ensemble at high

711
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:36,120
temperatures in particular related to the way that

712
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,300
the particle no, which can fluctuate in the great

713
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,890
approach, the way in which that particle no

714
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,660
depends on the temperature as a temperature.

715
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:53,070
That's the forecast for Friday. We will look at

716
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:56,910
that particular regime of the statistics we have

717
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:00,360
derived today. So I will see you then, unless

718
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,040
there are media questions about those on the

719
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:07,170
fermions or the resulting in differing sets of

720
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,170
statistics right now.

721
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,890
You had a few days to think about that and come up

722
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:21,990
with any questions to bring to me on Friday. I'll

723
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:23,930
look forward to seeing all that.
