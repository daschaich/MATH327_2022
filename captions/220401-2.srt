1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:09,520
So we are ready to go with the last meeting of

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,640
statistical physics before the break.

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,310
Starting with

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,600
the six digit code for this afternoon.

5
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,470
It's three two,

6
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,490
three nine, two nine.

7
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,130
And

8
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:47,360
we can wrap up quickly with the one last piece in this

9
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,730
supplement on the Sommerfeld expansion that we

10
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:55,460
didn't get to this morning.  Though I'll first check in if there

11
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,320
are any immediate questions about what went

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,110
through this morning.  This last piece is

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,720
not so much to do with the Sommerfeld expansion

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,740
itself as an alternative that we now have access

15
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,790
to, which is a real difference in the nineteen

16
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,740
hundreds. So the Somerfield expansion is a way to

17
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,230
recast, intractable, integral to a series of.

18
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,730
Management rules, we can compute word about order

19
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,180
finding this severe dependence on the temperature

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,680
and the heat capacity of the low temperature,

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,310
family gas and living order in what is a fact, an

22
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,540
expansion over here, an expansion in terms of this

23
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:55,130
ratio, the temperature divided by a fairly energy.

24
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,270
And we can expect this expansion to break down

25
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,140
when the temperature is an order that fury energy.

26
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,220
Not only are we neglecting the key to the fourth

27
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,030
effects, for instance, this equation, one of nine

28
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,970
of the consistency condition that we got from the

29
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,500
particle number that relates to the energy and the

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,170
chemical potential, depending on the temperature

31
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,410
of high square is about 10. So when T squared is

32
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,250
about one point two times per square, those two

33
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,790
terms will cancel out. The dominant contribution

34
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,380
will come from precisely the next correction that

35
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,190
we're due to the fourth over the energy to the

36
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,170
fourth that we have collected.

37
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,470
But.

38
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,860
We have that summer film doesn't is Python or more

39
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,880
specifically, computers that are capable of doing

40
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,330
easily numerical integration through Python or any

41
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:14,620
other programming model of. Of your choice, which

42
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,580
we can bring to bear on this problem by recasting

43
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,420
it first in terms of dimensionless, ratio's,

44
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,000
dimensionless degrees of freedom, which are the

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,360
ones that match up to what we have to

46
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,000
dimensionless numbers we have access to on a

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,610
computer as opposed to the temperature of energy.

48
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:40,180
The chemical potential has units of energy. So if

49
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,300
we go back to the full integral that we hit with

50
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,910
these our expansion to get a low temperature

51
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,900
approximation and we plug in the expression that

52
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,090
we have from earlier in the week for this pre

53
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,740
factor, the constant terms that are collected in

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,730
the states.

55
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,110
What we can do here is replace the square root of

56
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,860
energy and the differential to you by three has

57
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:20,290
powers of this X Times team. So we get a square

58
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,130
root X times X and then T to the power three

59
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,560
halves, which combine with whatever the Fairbury

60
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,540
energy to the three has. Power gives us the three

61
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,570
horsepower. They dimensionless ratio of the

62
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:40,540
temperature relative to the energy. And similarly.

63
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:48,700
Stick in this X for the. One of the exponential

64
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,570
factors is the data of the better times, it is

65
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,380
just the X that becomes an infinitely large number,

66
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,630
has X goes to infinity, which is by far the jokes

67
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,410
which rearrange that have very small factors of

68
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,130
the lightest X everywhere else in this ratio. And

69
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,470
then finally, we're left with an exponential of

70
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,140
minus B to be able to smooth over T. And if we

71
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,720
also introduce a dimensionless constancy as this

72
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,840
ratio of chemical potential to Fairbury energy,

73
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,950
then that exponential factor just matches into a C

74
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,930
divided by the dimensionless lowercase T.. We can

75
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,200
see if we look at that ratio of security factors

76
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,650
of Fairbury energy cancel out. And this is equal

77
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,850
to you over the dimension for capital here.

78
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,290
And just as we saw this morning in the summer

79
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,830
field expansion, we have factors of the average

80
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,380
particle number on each side of this equation that

81
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,920
drop out. And we are left with just the

82
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,170
consistency condition relating this. Complicated,

83
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:09,700
integral to Wilsonville, simple number one. What

84
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,700
we can do that is. Choose a value for the

85
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,060
temperature and choose a value for the sea, the

86
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,180
chemical potential telefon to evaluate, to go,

87
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,050
which only takes a few lines of code. Excellent

88
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,370
libraries available for iPhone and see if this

89
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,900
relationship works out, if we get one as demanded

90
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,830
by this consistency condition.

91
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:48,380
And what we can do at that point is keep rerunning

92
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,740
that conversation with a fixed temperature and

93
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,130
different values, the chemical potential, until we

94
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,720
find the correct value relative to the very energy

95
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,650
that satisfies that condition. We just arrived. So

96
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,770
why change?

97
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,890
Those. Projector here and look at a python code

98
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,930
that I will upload a canvas this afternoon. This

99
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,940
does essentially what we just went through. We

100
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,660
define a value for that dimensionless T so twice

101
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,680
the free energy in this case. And then adjust the

102
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,140
chemical potential in terms of the Fairbury energy

103
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:42,190
and numerically integrate dysfunction, the square

104
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,840
root of X times to the minus X divided by the

105
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,610
exponential of minus C over T minus 40, plus

106
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,060
another factor that into the minus X and check to

107
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,130
see how close we are to what we should have won.

108
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,780
So this is roughly where I ended up. So it should

109
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:10,130
be pretty close to one if I look at. This chemical

110
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,460
potential of about minus two and a half times the

111
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,160
very energy where a temperature of twice the

112
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,950
Fairbury energy, it's just about. Less than one

113
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:26,710
part per thousand of. And you fire and collect.

114
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:33,800
This result for the appropriate chemical potential

115
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,260
as a function of the temperature to the minus two

116
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,760
point four six corresponds to two point oh, then

117
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,900
that produces the very last red point on this plot,

118
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,650
which you see in a slightly larger size down here.

119
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,850
I just went through a handful of values of this

120
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,510
dimensionless ratio for the temperature, then the.

121
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,520
Correct, chemical potential, not as a fund or in

122
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,360
units of the free energy up to a couple of decimal

123
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,380
places, that just took a few minutes. And then I

124
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,610
can compare this to that, the order quadratic

125
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,760
result. We got this morning that showed. The

126
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,570
chemical potential approaching the family energy,

127
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,510
the limit of zero temperature with quadratic

128
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,670
corrections, at least in the regime of. Tea over

129
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,720
the energy that we can rely on the expansion to

130
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,720
converge. So you see there's good agreement for

131
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
small volumes of temperature, that quadratics

132
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,140
dependence. And I just thought of this dependence

133
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,090
beyond where we may expect to see problems. Indeed,

134
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,490
we do see some noticeable discrepancies setting in

135
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,900
right around. The. Value, there was first two

136
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,290
terms cancels out the expected issues. But maybe

137
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,880
the more interesting result here is following up

138
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,750
on something we came across earlier this week or

139
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,420
possibly the last week, which is that as the

140
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,230
temperature increases, we do indeed see the

141
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,800
chemical potential changing from negative, from

142
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,920
positive to negative, getting back into the

143
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,680
classical regime where we introduce the chemical

144
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,580
potential, where we want to take the classical

145
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,760
limit that corresponds to this high temperature

146
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,570
quantum gas with a large negative value of the

147
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:52,290
chemical potential. So that is going beyond the

148
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,730
limitations of the Sommerfeld expansion with some

149
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,330
assistance to modern technology and confirming

150
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,610
some of the claims earlier, and that's all there

151
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,880
is to say about all that I have to say for that

152
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,870
supplement.

153
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,900
And that lets us get back to the actual tutorial

154
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,650
problem that we just looked at fairly briefly

155
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,330
toward the end of last week, this Einstein model

156
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,140
will be solid where

157
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,690
someone just being pictured as some regular array

158
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:43,090
of atoms that are held in place by oscillators

159
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:43,780
between those.

160
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,780
Where each of these oscillators is treated as a

161
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:04,720
non interacting degree of freedom and. The.

162
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:11,450
Resulting heat capacity can be predicted compared

163
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,940
with these experimental data through the usual

164
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,510
sort of calculation we've been doing and we got to

165
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,260
the point last week checking on what would happen

166
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:29,000
if we followed these solids just as a bunch of

167
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,440
spins pointed up or down. Of course, with each

168
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:40,610
atom in this array finding that the capacity is

169
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,650
always negative as it should be and is

170
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,380
proportional to the inverse temperature squared

171
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,800
divided by the hyperbolic cosine of that inverse

172
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,380
temperature times the external magnetic field.

173
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,900
So this appropriately banished in the limit of

174
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,070
zero temperature in agreement with the data we

175
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:10,600
were looking at, this actually turns out to be. A

176
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,110
universal result sometimes called the third law of

177
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,670
thermodynamics. And related to the Entropia and

178
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:25,250
the connection between entropy and heat. But there

179
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:32,210
were problems if we try to match this bottle for a

180
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,440
solid, not attractive experience to the

181
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,770
experimental data that motivated this

182
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:44,030
consideration in the first place, as the

183
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:48,680
temperature gets large and small, the other side

184
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:54,290
goes to one and. The capacity as a whole vanishes

185
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,560
roughly proportionately to whatever temperature

186
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:04,140
square is shown here for. Temperatures larger than

187
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,070
that, I feel, in contrast to the experimental data

188
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,700
that roughly approach a constant battle that high

189
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,220
temperatures of a few hundred Kelvin.

190
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,730
So that's where the ISIS is aiming to make a

191
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,520
difference and provide a better description. And

192
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:32,400
we at least put up. Last week, this forced.

193
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,680
Procedure to derive the heat capacity from just

194
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,230
the definition of the bottle itself into the

195
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,960
oscillators has some amount of energy that comes

196
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,680
in quantize units motivated by Einstein's work on

197
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,930
the electric effect. And the statistics of

198
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,020
counting how those units of energy can be

199
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,680
distributed among the oscillators connecting the

200
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,910
atoms in this model of a solid. They'll give us

201
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,390
eventually the total number of microstates, the

202
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,230
entropy temperature, energy from its peak capacity.

203
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,660
So perhaps at this point I'll just pause the

204
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,200
recording for five minutes or so and you can. Let

205
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,000
me know how far you got along this path already

206
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,230
and how far you get at the end of that, unless

207
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,470
there are questions about the. The basic set of

208
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:44,400
definitions of this model where. I'm not going

209
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,030
over some of the things we introduced last week

210
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,130
with this case to a number of units of energy for

211
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,090
each Baalbeck as basic unit energy in an

212
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,690
oscillator itself. If that isn't clear, we can.

213
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:08,190
Revisit it and get up to speed. Otherwise. No hit,

214
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,440
pause and start timer.

215
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,830
So that was five minutes, just check and see how

216
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:20,480
it's come on, if you are having a slow time

217
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,550
getting started or or the job and board.

218
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,600
I will say that this first step is figuring out

219
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,030
the total number of microstates is the real needs

220
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,380
of the of the problem. And once we have the total

221
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,420
number of states that everything else sort of

222
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,970
follows through the work we've done. It sounds

223
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:44,270
like

224
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:54,950
customize. Yeah, that sounds right. To have a

225
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,080
spoiler factor.

226
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,800
That was last.

227
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,660
This one,

228
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,760
which is equal to.

229
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:19,940
Chris. That is indeed what I have. And if everyone

230
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:24,920
is happy with that, we can look at a.

231
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,650
My favorite way of driving that, which there are

232
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,590
many ways of getting at this result,

233
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,090
but it's one nice one is recognizing that the

234
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,310
competition works here is divided, dividing two

235
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,720
units of energy into an indistinguishable

236
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,930
oscillators distinguishable due to their fixed

237
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,830
location in the solid. So this is the same county

238
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,910
as putting bolts into boxes. And we did when

239
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:03,130
introducing quantum statistics with the change

240
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,270
that the boxes are since you are now

241
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:15,100
distinguishable. It can be. Defined by putting in

242
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,120
and minus four walls, dividing these boxes in a

243
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,150
sequence of symbols corresponding either to the

244
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,600
units of energy or the dividing lines between the

245
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,150
oscillators that are going into it. So this sort

246
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:34,940
of sequence of symbols. We describe what is that,

247
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,060
11 minutes of energy divided among six boxes

248
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,480
through 16 symbols, so.

249
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:50,350
And minus one of those plastic balls and. All that

250
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:55,640
we have to do is choose. All of the possible ways

251
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,490
for a case of these case, plus embarrassment,

252
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:03,080
symbols to be units of energy that are

253
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,120
distinguishable and we then have all of the

254
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,740
remaining symbols are fixed to be those dividing

255
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:19,650
lines, the walls. Fully specifies microstates. And

256
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:26,500
you can check out. As I have this printed out, I

257
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,470
do it through here quickly.

258
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,720
You seem to be in good shape with this.

259
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:41,130
Check the results against that minimal system of

260
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,840
three oscillators,

261
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,360
if there are no use of energy to the state to

262
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,240
distribute among those three oscillators, there's

263
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,990
only a single microstates. Each oscillator has

264
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,560
units of energy that is equal to.

265
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,020
So.

266
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,140
Three oscillators to

267
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:21,300
choose to choose zero is only one possible way of

268
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,600
managing that. We thought it was one minute of

269
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,360
energy, it could be either of those three

270
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,390
oscillators. That's three microstates, which is

271
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,480
the three choose one. And something interesting

272
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,900
happens when we have two units of energy, we

273
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,380
finally get something that is not possible with

274
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,940
that spin system. The spin, we could just have a

275
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,490
spin pointing up or down, we could call that no

276
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,300
energy or what you have to do in this model. We

277
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,690
now have the possibility of having an oscillator

278
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,340
with two units of energy, something going beyond

279
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,940
the system. So we have this three microstates

280
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,860
where. The two units of energy are either the

281
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,520
three oscillators or the three different ways of

282
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,810
having one unit of energy to mobilize voters. And

283
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,860
the third one having no energy. So six microstates

284
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:26,810
in total. Which we want to match for choose to,

285
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,200
which is four factorial over two squared, which is

286
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:37,420
the. Six. For them, sometimes to two square,

287
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,210
finally. The three units of energy, we can have,

288
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,360
all three in one of these oscillators, you can

289
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,050
have one unit in each of them. Or six possible

290
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:55,570
ways of dividing two units of energy in one

291
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:01,010
oscillator and one unit in another. And that three

292
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:06,650
plus one four six is 10, which is that five choose

293
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:13,700
three is five times four. Overtrading is a B10.

294
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:22,520
So that is a check that the explicit computation

295
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,190
we can do with a small number of oscillators

296
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,450
matches this combinatorial result in terms of.

297
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,330
Satriale's and binomial coefficients go back to

298
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,420
the usual regime for a solid working with blink of

299
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,620
an eye is no worth of oscillators, ten of the

300
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,920
twenty three and a comparable number of units of

301
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,370
energy to distribute among them. I can simplify

302
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,580
things just slightly by dropping those miners arms

303
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,940
even within the factory. We could say that this

304
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,750
ratio of factory owners is approximately given by

305
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:06,930
just Caples and factorial factory and factory. And

306
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,800
the logarithm of that ratio gives us the entropy

307
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,720
that we can hit with the leading order of

308
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:22,060
Serling's approximation and again, minus in the

309
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,900
linear terms, K plus and minus K minus N cancel

310
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,070
out. So we're left with just combinations of logs,

311
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,210
Caples and types, along with cables and by key

312
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,220
like minus and walk and.

313
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,330
So that is already the second bullet point to the

314
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,080
step to capacity and the third is taking the

315
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,370
derivative of the entropy with respect to the

316
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:54,690
energy that defines the inverse temperature. Of

317
00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,480
the solid. And this is usually what we. Just plug

318
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:05,160
in the relation between the energy and the units

319
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,720
of energy that gets. The derivative in terms of

320
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,130
this cave, which already expressed things in the

321
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,520
pick up of what it was in derivatives of the K

322
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,670
through 12 of the law, takes the cake. Listen to

323
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:25,930
the denominator of two plus one. And similarly,

324
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,540
you get along OK, the negative side. Now, that

325
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,100
minus K over today, which is one cancels out that

326
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,140
we can combine things. Into the temperature given

327
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,280
by the unit of energy that we work with in the

328
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,500
solid. Times, this logarithm of cupolas and

329
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,310
overcatch, which is one plus and over record with

330
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:55,920
both and K Motors positive numbers could be invert

331
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,670
to bring down the temperature is made up, divided

332
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:05,420
by this log. We can easily see that the

333
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,080
temperature is indeed positive. We have a lot of

334
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,700
something that is greater than one.

335
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,640
So this. Corresponds to what we call the natural

336
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,540
systems of the MicroCon global context. With the

337
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:26,190
positive temperature already a contrast with the

338
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,470
spin system, which is where we introduce the idea

339
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:35,030
of temperatures in the first place. And as we

340
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:41,260
discussed back in. That needed to come out, so the

341
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,220
natural positive temperature reflects the fact

342
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,660
that more and more microstates are opened up when

343
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,160
we have larger amounts of energy in the system to

344
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,590
unlike the spin system, where it's going to be

345
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:00,240
filled with so much the maximum amount of energy

346
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,240
that they're able to carry. Here we can just keep

347
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,240
adding more and more use of energy to each of

348
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,600
these oscillators and have more ways of

349
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,570
distributing those using energy among the. Total

350
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:22,240
number of isolators. Well, as. As he increases.

351
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:30,680
And I have here flooded the relation between that

352
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,560
cave and the energy itself, because the energy

353
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:39,380
itself is what we want to isolate in order to get

354
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:45,040
to the heat capacity. So rearranging this

355
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,810
expression, taking the one off into left hand side

356
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:53,070
and dividing through body temperature multiplied

357
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,900
by below the exponential rates both sides and

358
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,840
subtract that one can get an elevator for a mega

359
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:08,680
minus one related to. This and Farmigo divided by

360
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,030
energy, that reorienting again gives us the energy.

361
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:18,530
Is in today's world divided by this exponential

362
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:26,390
factor? That is not so dissimilar to the

363
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:30,580
expansions we were seeing for a full time gas, and

364
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:35,340
that is. And observation will come back to to wrap

365
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,900
things up, but at this point, we now have the

366
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,860
capacity, the derivative of that energy with

367
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,420
respect to.

368
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,700
The temperature that we can relate to, minus the

369
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,920
spirit times, the derivative with respect to the

370
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,210
inverse temperature, and that is a straightforward

371
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,780
derivative to do the denominator. Brings in a

372
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,300
negative sign that cancels out literally the sign

373
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,830
denominator squared and the chain rule through HBO

374
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,350
may get you to the better part, may go and change

375
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,860
variables to the one that suggested the problem is

376
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:23,660
X equal, better age. But we can see towers of

377
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,650
better in each of the numerator. So X squared

378
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:33,560
added to the X to the numerator divided by X minus

379
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,160
one squared. And the denominator.

380
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:45,340
So this is the result equation one in this in

381
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,490
these comments on the real problem, that is the

382
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,100
that is the capacity for nine states. And the

383
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:57,660
question now is how does it compare to the

384
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,790
experimental measurements that we started off with

385
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,860
and so on, did not work with the studio system

386
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,410
before getting into that many questions about the

387
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:14,770
steps coming up to here. Sort of once once the

388
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:18,030
total number of microstates was expressed in

389
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,300
functional form, it was basically targeting

390
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,270
through the sequence of definitions of reason

391
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:34,410
before to turn the crank to the capacity. So just

392
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,080
as we did for that school system, we can start by

393
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,440
considering the high, low temperature limits of

394
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,730
the sea capacity and see whether and if so, how

395
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:49,610
well they respond to what we want to describe

396
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,010
experimentally. And the low temperature limit.

397
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:56,280
This X is inversely proportional to the T and goes

398
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,460
to infinity is always exponential is a very large

399
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,480
numbers. We can ignore the minus one in the

400
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,570
denominator and end up with something that. As a

401
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,870
factor of the age of the X in the denominator of

402
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,010
vanishes exponentially quickly as the temperature

403
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:22,470
goes to zero. This is. This vanishing, of course,

404
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:27,080
is required by that third law of thermodynamics. I

405
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,950
mentioned at the start of this, we know that the

406
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,330
heat capacity has to be limited to the absolute

407
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,270
zero temperature. And the fact that it does so

408
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:41,070
exponentially quickly is similar to the spin

409
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:48,870
system and also. A quantitative poll comparing to

410
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,910
experimental data. We'll get into that in just a

411
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:56,240
bit. We got to check the height of where the

412
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,590
system broke down completely it here and the

413
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:04,880
exponential E to the X can be expanded into a

414
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,610
power series in the usual way at the leading order.

415
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,280
We can just approximate the X is one of the

416
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,200
numerator and one plus X. The denominator, which

417
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,980
would be minus one, is cancel out leaves and X

418
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,880
squared to cancel the X squared the numerator and

419
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,720
tells us that the heat capacity approach is a

420
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,430
constant value that is non-zero. So rather than.

421
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,270
Dropping back down quadratics, the disorder in the

422
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,480
expansion of the exponential in terms of the

423
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:48,490
temperature, we see something much more promising

424
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:55,910
with that cause the dotted line that. Is. That is

425
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,960
possibly consistent with the experimental data.

426
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,950
Overall.

427
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,880
Now, we can also go beyond that, just that leading

428
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,240
asymptotic limit could be equal to the number of

429
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,150
oscillators that actually compute the

430
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:18,460
leading temperature dependent's to this result.

431
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:22,180
This is similar to some of the stuff that we do on

432
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:28,210
the homework. Seem to be graded where the king is,

433
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,770
I'm sure you've seen, is. In the expansion's

434
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:36,150
keeping enough terms to work with a given how the

435
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,320
mix in the full expression rather than the

436
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,770
numerator or denominator by itself. So expanding

437
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,350
the exponential is to a few orders it out again,

438
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,480
but leaving one of the denominator, we can pull

439
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,020
out of X squared to cancel with the X squared of

440
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,350
the numerator. And then square the remaining terms

441
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:05,890
later and start with that one squared that have

442
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:12,100
two times I have X from the crossroads and then we

443
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,590
have again to tie this to one sixth from the

444
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:18,310
crossroads of X squared, one in the square, and

445
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:23,290
then another quarter from this over to quantity

446
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:29,160
squared. That. Three twelfths plus four fouls as

447
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,540
of the Seven Dwarfs, and we can change the

448
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,770
denominator into the geometric series up to now.

449
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:45,140
Kubic Order in this small X. So we have to retain

450
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,300
up to quadraphonic order, enumerator. And up to

451
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,450
quarter to quarter, both in the term being treated

452
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:02,060
as small to expand, that is serious as well as the

453
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,820
number of terms in that series the quadratic will

454
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,120
get.

455
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,390
This now just becomes a question of expanding out

456
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:16,960
this product. One time want to give the living

457
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,350
constitution and then two terms that come in a

458
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:25,900
linear order. Next, we have. X times one plus one.

459
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:31,440
Times X and then this minus six times one is a

460
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:35,710
minus one, so those two terms cancel out at the X

461
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,400
squared level. We can start with product of those

462
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,340
two terms coming in with a plus a half. And then

463
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:48,200
minus X times X comes in with a minus one minus

464
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,830
seven, 12 X squared times one minus seven plus,

465
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:56,720
and finally the one times X squared from here

466
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,360
brings in the one to cancel out that we were left

467
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:07,100
with six twelfths minus seven 12 leaves us with

468
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,490
quadratic dependence on the inverse temperature

469
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:14,950
and alcohol factor with each bar squared squared

470
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:23,060
of the twelve. So as shown in this figure, this is

471
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,960
the plot of the exercise on high capacity

472
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,930
approaching that constant factor at high

473
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,480
temperatures vanishing exponentially at low

474
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,010
temperatures. And we just arrived at the rate at

475
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,610
which high temperature limit was approached,

476
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:47,180
vanishing quite radically in the temperature. So

477
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:53,690
this plot, at least, is consistent with our

478
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,770
experimental data and the fact that I am flipping

479
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,320
between two sheets of paper, one with the

480
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,410
theoretical prediction of some experimental data

481
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:04,990
reminds me of.

482
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,930
A saying by the gunman many years ago that in

483
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,600
physics it's customary to put theory and

484
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,420
experiments on the same piece of paper, and that's

485
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,660
something that you can play with during the break

486
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,070
by inserting units for these temperatures. Each

487
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:30,110
participant to try to match up to the scale with

488
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,260
which the heat capacity is being measured from

489
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:40,890
these data. Speaking of that scale. It becomes

490
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,430
interesting and actually reveals a flaw in the

491
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,360
design of solid if we zoom in so much lower

492
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,090
temperatures. So rather than the hundreds of

493
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:55,350
kaledin that we have here, we started looking at

494
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,820
zoomed into Tev about four Kelvin and below 40,

495
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:05,880
squared up to 18 and plotted on the vertical axis

496
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,850
here, not the heat capacity itself, but rather the

497
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:13,080
ratio of heat capacity and temperature. We can see

498
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,070
the limit of absolute zero goes to a non-zero

499
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,470
value slightly below one, these units of

500
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,640
individuals per square. It is then. Very well

501
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:30,620
described by a straight line in T-square, which is

502
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:35,330
to say that the capacity itself has some linear

503
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:40,330
peace process that intercept Alpha and a cubit

504
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:44,870
piece proportional to that that slope gave up in

505
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:51,610
this plot. And this is, as we mentioned, not what

506
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,810
the unsign solid gibs that predicted next

507
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:59,710
eventually vanishing chip capacity and zero

508
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,760
temperatures. So we did not have straight lines on

509
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,180
a plot like this. This is a polynomial approach,

510
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:12,800
in particular, this polynomial. And actually, from

511
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:19,360
the work we did this morning, we know we recognize

512
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,260
this linear contribution to the heat capacity as

513
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:28,190
the prediction that we got for a low temperature

514
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:33,130
for gas through the leading order of the overfill

515
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:39,250
expansion. We have that result.

516
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,910
Now, the last thing we did this morning, which was

517
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,210
a bit rushed at the end, was fine for the heat

518
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:51,690
capacity. They said, look, temperature through the

519
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,860
summer. The question is, is PI squared over two

520
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,790
times the number of particles over the feel the

521
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,210
energy policy mix that identifies both the

522
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:09,480
functional form and the value of this alpha

523
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,650
parameter in PI squared over two times the energy.

524
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:18,240
Which can be compared to this experimental data to

525
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:25,000
actually measure the energy of. The electron gas

526
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,720
that we can attribute this this turn its

527
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,490
contribution to heat capacity to.

528
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,240
And we can also actually, just in the last five

529
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,000
minutes, motivate without going through the full

530
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,860
derivation where the tube is coming from and why

531
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,550
the Einstein song gets it wrong.

532
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:53,100
The key picture is that these oscillators that are

533
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,370
being treated as completely independent body

534
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,670
interact and feel

535
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:03,000
that they are connected to the very atoms. And in

536
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,880
an actual solid whenever one of these atoms starts

537
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,240
to wiggle around and try to move, it's going to

538
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:15,840
affect the atoms around it. And you can expect the

539
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,510
movements of atoms in a solid to form a pattern

540
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,520
and in particular this sort of pattern. And I know

541
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,270
sort of skipping through these comments pretty

542
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:33,010
quickly will get uploaded for you if you. But let

543
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,280
me see the dots. And here is. Representative Adam

544
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,000
along one dimension of itself, and the idea is

545
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,080
that these can be modeled as propagating waves.

546
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,390
The displacements and the atoms from their

547
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:54,180
composition is correlated with that, the adults

548
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:58,880
around them. In patterns with wavelength and

549
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,400
frequency, it's just like those we considered for

550
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,560
photons,

551
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:08,570
the difference with photons, though, is that when

552
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,850
we get to very high frequency, these are very

553
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:14,540
short wavelengths. There's actually a cutoff on.

554
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,470
How should we like to be? We can't have atoms that

555
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:23,200
are. Having a collective motion on a shorter

556
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,350
distance scale than actually separates those atoms,

557
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:30,430
there's nothing collective left behind with this

558
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:33,760
cut off and the frequency is the maximum frequency

559
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,390
is proportional to the cube root of the number of

560
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:41,560
atoms, which is different by a factor of three

561
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,600
compared to the number of oscillators. So these

562
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,100
waves in sorrow's collected motion of atoms are

563
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,900
called photons.

564
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:58,080
And they behaved in some ways quite similarly to

565
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:03,180
photons. There are other. Important differences,

566
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,180
chief among them being this cut off on the back,

567
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:11,550
some frequency. So if just to wrap up the first

568
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:16,770
nine weeks of the module, go back to page 111 and

569
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:20,290
look at the energy density for a full time gas.

570
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,430
And instead of integrating the frequencies up to

571
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:27,360
infinity, we cut them off at some maximum

572
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,620
frequency. Let me go through the usual change in

573
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,210
variables that we did I.

574
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,400
Last week, or possibly even two weeks ago now for

575
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,200
the first time, gas, then this X integrity over is

576
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,110
inversely proportional to the temperature and the

577
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:49,280
integrity is cut off at some function of

578
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:53,560
temperature. And we can now look at the high, low

579
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,120
temperature behaviors of this at high temperatures

580
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,840
relative to this so-called DIBBY temperature t

581
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,230
study. That is some complicated combination of

582
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:07,220
constants coming into this way of looking at

583
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:11,940
things, the so-called bi theory of solids. Well,

584
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,510
that X is very small, we can just expand the

585
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:22,500
exponential, get to one plus X, minus one X, the

586
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:28,080
denominator that is a integral to do the role of X

587
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,440
squared is executed. So we end up with three

588
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,620
powers of the temperature from the limit of

589
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:38,410
integration to cancel out three of the four powers

590
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,370
in temperature. You started off with short on gas.

591
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,250
So we end up with. Energy that is linear in the

592
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,700
temperature, which means a heat capacity that is

593
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,310
constant, and it turns out to be that you actually

594
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:56,390
go through the calculation the same constant as

595
00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:01,600
the guys solo. Just found one in the units

596
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,510
reported earlier, but of course, the interesting

597
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,820
stuff happens at low temperatures. That's where

598
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:13,320
the cell breaks down. And the divide approach. Has

599
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,970
this cut off on the education, becomes very large,

600
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:20,270
approximately, gets back to the full integral from

601
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,670
zero to infinity? We considered in Section eight

602
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,310
with three. Which was that delightful combination

603
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:34,880
of game of four and three zero four. But the key

604
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,240
is that that is just a constant no high school

605
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,260
over 15. So this for. To the fourth, dependent's

606
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,950
remains in the energy density at low temperatures,

607
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:54,210
taking a derivative means the heat capacity. Is

608
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:59,310
vanishing without proportionately to T cubed,

609
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,920
exactly as we saw in this more detailed look at

610
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:10,520
lower temperatures. So that is. All I have to say

611
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:16,650
about that really enjoyable to see. Some actual

612
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,610
comparisons with experimental data and the

613
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,130
considerations you have to go through in order to

614
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,520
get realistic physical predictions out of

615
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:34,560
knowledge, ranking systems could be three weeks.

616
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,860
I'll be in touch in the meantime and start to look

617
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,180
at the complications that show up when we go

618
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,530
beyond the non interactive theories like these and

619
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:49,900
actually introduce interactions to very

620
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:55,110
sophisticated physics. So you were able to have an

621
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:58,920
enjoyable and productive break. I'll see you a few

622
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,390
minutes from.
