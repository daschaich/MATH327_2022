00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,970
I'm running just slightly late this afternoon, but we can

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,600
get underway now with the next six digit number

3
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,580
for this afternoon,

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,400
which does not have to do

5
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:27,790
with these mass densities.

6
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,500
Today it is nine eight

7
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,470
two zero, nine six.

8
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,960
And let's start, to see if there are any questions

9
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,090
about any topic we've been covering so far in this

10
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,650
module, Including the second part of that computer

11
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,380
project that's due next week.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,360
I'll say that this is the last tutorial

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,220
before that deadline and we will have another set

14
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,420
of office hours Monday afternoon. And this is a

15
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:27,000
quick. Notes I put in the miscellaneous section of

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,670
the material on canvas, just a couple of links are

17
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,330
actually a couple of paragraphs that I downloaded

18
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,950
from relatively recent applications of anomalous

19
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,630
diffusion published in the journal Physical Review

20
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,990
Letters, which publishes short four or five page

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,430
papers looking at things like anomalous diffusion

22
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,710
in terms of how genes move around in DNA from

23
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,160
about 10 years ago, as well as a more recent

24
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,620
letter that.

25
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,260
Some supplemental material getting it up to 10

26
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,370
pages, but maybe of some general interest in how

27
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,590
it reviews.

28
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,040
Different contexts in which both sub diffusion and

29
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,390
super diffusion occur in biophysical contexts,

30
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,020
which is what these folks are working on, things

31
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,230
related to polymers, education, DNA, active

32
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,070
networks.

33
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,690
Motion of tracer particles in in cells, so lots of.

34
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,510
References there to. Applications of supervision

35
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,330
and substitution, specifically in biophysics,

36
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,290
which were considered interesting enough by the

37
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,410
editors of that journal that they commissioned,

38
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,310
Dave Schwartz, less technical summary of. How all

39
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,480
of this supervision and subterfuge have come into

40
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,420
play in actual physical systems.

41
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,390
That is just in the final miscellaneous section of

42
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,370
the budget materials for those who are interested.

43
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,390
And with that.

44
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,890
Out of the way and mentioned. You can pick up with

45
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,410
not this, but what we were doing at. Last Friday.

46
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,580
That up to steal the screen and.

47
00:03:52,910 --> 00:04:01,660
As a. Reminder of last week we had. A bit too much

48
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,540
material to get through the time available, so

49
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,070
this tutorial problem on the auto cycle for a

50
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,950
petrol engine is something that we just sort of

51
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,900
tossed out at the end with the idea that could we

52
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:24,050
visited. Today. We're just as a quick reminder,

53
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,670
the engine has like the carbon cycle, four stages.

54
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,010
No, in contrast to the current cycle, rather than

55
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,250
waiting for heat to be exchanged between external

56
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,580
hot and cold reservoirs. What happens with the

57
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:47,510
auto cycle is that after the. The fuel, so the gas

58
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,370
is a mixture of air and vaporized petrol is

59
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,690
compressed to some small volume V two, it is

60
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,520
ignited and burned the internal combustion process

61
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,970
to crank up the temperature of the pressure very

62
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,970
quickly at that fixed volume. And that high

63
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,240
pressure can then be used to generate work or

64
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,830
power from the expansion cycle before. That

65
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:19,050
HÃ¶gberg fuel is expelled and replaced with a new

66
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,280
cooler mixture for the cycle to begin again,

67
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,620
keeping the same number of particles even as

68
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,270
particles are expelled and replaced from outside.

69
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,610
The question was. What is the efficiency of this

70
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,920
cycle in particular in terms of this compression

71
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:44,160
ratio between the large and small volumes? And how

72
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,110
that compares to the efficiency we computed. Last

73
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,150
week for the annual cycle.

74
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,180
And one topic I was going to. Mentioned briefly

75
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,620
even before diving into this out of cycle was an

76
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,160
alternative way of representing these cycles, both

77
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,270
Kernow as well as other cycles and many others,

78
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,770
that

79
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,440
takes advantage of the set of. Thermodynamic

80
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,990
equations that we. I wrote down for some the

81
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:30,770
cycles to express. All aspects of the system in

82
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,280
terms of a different set of variables rather than

83
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,750
the pressure and volume. So we've seen a

84
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,740
reminder from just law books, both empty,

85
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,370
specifying both pressure and volume, determines

86
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,360
the temperature

87
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,500
of the volume and temperature determines usually.

88
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,660
Find the entropy is proportional to that volume of

89
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,950
temperature to the three taps power, so an

90
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,560
alternative set of. Freedom parameters that we can

91
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:17,920
work with. Let me see if I can. He with the finger

92
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,860
and the question on the screen there, through this

93
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,090
sort of pressure and volume, we can work with the

94
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:31,750
temperature and can see underlining the state as

95
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,930
well as with the interview and from those get back

96
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,240
and forth between pressure and volume

97
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,070
to temperature and entropy.

98
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,400
So I removed myself.

99
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,490
Which of these two are most traditional there on

100
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,890
which axis the entropy is actually treated as the

101
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,760
x axis temperature on the y axis of these

102
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,560
so-called S.T. diagrams? As opposed to PV diagrams,

103
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,000
if we.

104
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,910
Call the news cycle, we're in the TV diagram, we

105
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,620
have to idiomatic expansion into precious stages,

106
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,640
interweaved with two isothermal progression and

107
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:35,190
expansion stages. As a reminder, boy in for final

108
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:41,030
was like. That where.

109
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,450
Scott.

110
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,870
It's not the best. But the.

111
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,940
Those up 80 stages connected to two stages, so.

112
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,320
That's.

113
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,030
Was there?

114
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:21,440
And so Adams on the other two stages. And

115
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,990
in contrast to how tricky it was for me to draw

116
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,240
that diagram before we see the entirety of your

117
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,900
diagram for the current cycle, it's much easier to

118
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,890
draw those terms or processes with constant

119
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:44,660
temperature. So the idioms that we've seen with no

120
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,400
exchange of sheets have no change. And there's a

121
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,380
constant central issue which leads to the current

122
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,360
cycle just being a.

123
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:04,460
Square or a rectangle in the axis of.

124
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,530
Temperature and the. And.

125
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,870
Whereas in the case of PV diagrams, we had a of

126
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,570
radical interpretation of the work, and it's that

127
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,730
area closed

128
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,620
under the cycle, so.

129
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,570
Work integrated.

130
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,680
We move forward and back with the negative side.

131
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,070
So canceling out, that is under both of those two

132
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,970
lines and keeping all boys in between the call

133
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,280
that similarly

134
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:03,660
keeps deploying and entropy put on that x axis,

135
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,730
then we end up with each

136
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:16,330
others operating cycles. That's it would be fine.

137
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,410
So that's just an alternate representation of the

138
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:26,730
two cycles. That's the whole case. There would

139
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,440
be up not here, the TV diagram correspondents that

140
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:43,430
I've crossed onto this diagram. So for the other

141
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,060
cycle.

142
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,100
Hopefully is usable, we have again to idiomatic

143
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:56,670
compression and expansion phases, which

144
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,080
mean.

145
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:18,580
So there will be two council phases and then in

146
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,320
between then we have this constant volume increase

147
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,500
or decrease in the pressure and temperature. So

148
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,920
the heat is being pumped into the system by

149
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,370
burning its fuel. So that increases the entropy at

150
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,450
the same time as it increases the temperature. And

151
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,120
similarly, at the exhaust stage when he is dumped

152
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,430
out into the environment.

153
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,210
There is

154
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,090
a decrease in the temperature and the interest of

155
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,780
the system and entropy being pumped out along with

156
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:01,210
the heat, so integrating these PV and AC diagrams

157
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,810
will give both the heat and the work.

158
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,600
So just to be precise, before we get back into the

159
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,740
actual question, that was, is the Baltimore Sun,

160
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,980
yes, going from four to one is cooling down the

161
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,280
system. So decreasing its temperature and its

162
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,600
pressure at a fixed point, the small of

163
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,810
civil rights people.

164
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:48,360
We have a free choice of volumes and we have to

165
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,870
specify at least one of the pressures in order to

166
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,110
close the cycle, if we go around this in a.

167
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,540
Rigorous analysis and essentially what we have at

168
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,440
our freedom, there's.

169
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:09,090
The temperature of the Interreg gas, as we bring

170
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,340
it in, assuming that the cycle has been running

171
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,760
for a while so that the engine is as hot as it's

172
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,820
going to be, not overheating, so that fixed

173
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,780
temperature is going to be set by how hot the time

174
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,480
is, how hot the engine is running. And then we

175
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,920
just need to pump out all of the. Burns fuel that

176
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,740
is at a higher temperature from having been burned

177
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,510
and then replace it with the fresh fuel mixture at

178
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,280
the same temperature. We started off with, which

179
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,640
necessarily lowers the pressure while the fight

180
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,870
against the occupation and be fixed in temperature

181
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,080
correspondingly lowers the pressure. So. We are

182
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,230
able to analyze this in the same terms. As a TV

183
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,500
diagram, even though it differs from Kurnos

184
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,830
original idea that we have some large external

185
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:08,540
reservoir that is shifting heat into and out of

186
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,490
the system just through from contact. Instead, we

187
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,510
have ignition and exhaust as ways to speed up the

188
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:20,970
process and have engines that run at several

189
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,170
thousand revolutions per minute rather than taking

190
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,980
several minutes for resolution.

191
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:35,120
And what I should ask at this stage is, are you

192
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,290
already done with. The question of calculating the

193
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,350
efficiency of the auto cycle or should we take

194
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:49,750
five minutes to. Work out that seem to be. Working

195
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:56,390
so. That's a sign she paused for those five

196
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:02,030
minutes reporting to check in. At that point.

197
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,540
After 20 past.

198
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,800
That was the worst ever for me to check in, having

199
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,980
what still seemed to be part of work on Friday,

200
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,180
just it to another.

201
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,300
But about a five minute period for you to keep

202
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,180
working on this. Are there any obstacles that have

203
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,950
come up so far?

204
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,000
It's just a matter of pushing through the.

205
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,360
Computation can help you with it, at least for

206
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,970
another. Five minutes before. Another chicken.

207
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,560
And the recording and say that maybe with at this

208
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,710
point, see how far we got out and.

209
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,780
Able to simplify things.

210
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,750
In terms of

211
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,630
looking at the efficiency of general expression,

212
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:53,470
that efficiency is the net amount of work put out

213
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:59,660
by the system that works in from the surroundings

214
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,980
to break the cycle, complete with the bottom line

215
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,160
that comes in, in this case, in the form of

216
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,560
burning fuel. In addition.

217
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,140
Well,

218
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,300
interestingly enough, some of you that

219
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:29,560
saw on this panel, you have the three. Quaternions

220
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:40,380
to return. And your work so far, it seen that the

221
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:49,710
system is the negative of the work done by. How

222
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,130
are things going to have a positive quality

223
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,230
negative work from three to four since that's the.

224
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:05,950
That is the major change in the energy, which, by

225
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,040
the way, was key to the equation cycles. It's just

226
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,280
three times and

227
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:24,020
the change is positive. Then Scorpion's.

228
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,280
Nearly the same one, the compression faced three

229
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,320
different sizes because the work is being done by

230
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:40,820
this system, which is the positive change from

231
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,740
point one to point to

232
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,370
the ads and

233
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:59,390
also the new needs to be. And then because Putin

234
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,400
is going to change the volume is zero and a fixed

235
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,400
volume, there is no work being done. So this is

236
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,880
also

237
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,610
for change and energy.

238
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,320
Those two to three

239
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,680
is part of the

240
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,310
picture. So ever

241
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:38,510
since all these factors that have been cast, that

242
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:38,930
is just

243
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:48,350
on the almost by the estimates of two one by.

244
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:57,950
To pull that, he wants to go to France to have one

245
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,150
like this one's for.

246
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,990
And this, too, may well look familiar from

247
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:18,370
the past few minutes. Now.

248
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,120
No, no.

249
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,430
So that's the starting point for people who want

250
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,750
to help, aside from the large scale of regional

251
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,910
pressure and temperature, but we're going to have

252
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,100
to do the same so we have a seasonal space.

253
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,980
Whenever a burning fuel is pushed out into, the

254
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:47,260
demand has to be replaced immediately with a fresh

255
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,990
batch of fuels that no article statistics, even

256
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,930
which these particles they are, is evolving. So

257
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:00,220
that is an important condition for analyzing for

258
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,300
cycles through the canonical ensemble that fixes

259
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:12,080
the temperature. No. That insurance for was. And

260
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,010
that. In particular, it is also part of that

261
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,690
condition for constant intracranial.

262
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,060
That this country needs is proportional to just

263
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,100
that combination of the temperature when the of is

264
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:33,540
six. I mentioned that interview commission as it

265
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,070
is a useful way to simplify this, to get to the

266
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,890
promised result of this efficiency is to depend

267
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,480
only on that compression ratio of the one divided

268
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,350
by two to.

269
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:54,150
Rich. We can see that by applying that condition

270
00:22:54,150 --> 00:23:01,430
of entry to both of the antibiotic cycles where me

271
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,500
Constance's will do that over here at.

272
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:16,250
Just because. In addition, here comes the boiling

273
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,490
water temperature, one, two, three,

274
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:28,910
two, three. And similarly.

275
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,410
For.

276
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,860
That's kind of the general rule.

277
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,950
So this is the second or full cycle one this stage,

278
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:52,970
as well as for that stage to be the for some

279
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:59,450
rearranging things, they have ratios to one to two

280
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,140
to four to.

281
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,320
What will prevent depression with your help and

282
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,820
also the same ratio that pops up from other power

283
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,020
stage just as the ratio of for

284
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,800
to three?

285
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,230
Or if I rearrange those equations

286
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:46,150
to one, which is the same. As to what was he did

287
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,700
through?

288
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,590
Let's see what we can do with this expression

289
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:11,140
later on this morning. Well, the bottom line is

290
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:20,340
since to one, all he wanted was to oversee this

291
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,600
whole factor in parentheses. This one, the

292
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:30,120
efficiency is one minus that ratio for over three

293
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:37,140
that we identify as the compression ratio to two

294
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,670
thirds. And that is the answer to the first

295
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:47,440
question. Keeping an eye on the clock to wrap

296
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,170
things up today on his charge ahead with.

297
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,270
Your comments about the other two pieces of this

298
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,980
problem, because the comparison

299
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:09,910
is efficiency is the problem. So if you plug in

300
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,750
rather than whatever depression version of the two

301
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:18,460
thirds for this speculative for which you three

302
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:24,040
other ratio tell the truth, then express the other

303
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:31,450
side of this numbers, the ratio between two, which

304
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:41,820
is less than one, the T cycle, which is two begins.

305
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,940
And it's easy to see where this inequality comes

306
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,830
from with teaching itself. The temperature before

307
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,270
the fuels is able to stop being smaller than two

308
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,100
three. So there

309
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:04,840
is longer and subtracting a larger number. For one,

310
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,130
you say reduce the efficiency cycle. Which is what

311
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:14,990
we expect, given what we saw was the theoretical

312
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,070
maximum. So the best we could do would be throw

313
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,420
the other side well, is less efficient, but much

314
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:27,090
faster to operate in an internal combustion engine.

315
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,540
But the last comment for today has to do with

316
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:37,790
maximizing the efficiency of this cycle, which you

317
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:44,810
can do by maximizing this compression ratio. So as

318
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,240
our goes to infinity.

319
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:01,120
There's a ratio of the boils over which this

320
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,810
engine is operating, it's become larger and larger,

321
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,080
the efficiency gets better and better, and there's

322
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,930
less relative amount of energy lost to wastage

323
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,360
compared to the amount that is converted into used

324
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:23,020
to work. So what we would want to do to make our

325
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,170
petrol engine as efficient as possible is make

326
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,560
this with compression and power stage as long as

327
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:34,180
possible. Which went into some practical

328
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:40,420
limitations, because as we compress the mixture of

329
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:44,340
air and vaporize petrol that is burned as fuel in

330
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:49,660
these engines, the temperature is steadily rising

331
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,970
through the ideal gas law. This is adiabatic

332
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,290
compression.

333
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:06,230
That's. Leads to larger temperature as the system

334
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,140
is compressed with no ability to exchange heat

335
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,020
with its surroundings, and if that temperature

336
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,010
becomes too large, then it is possible for that

337
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,940
mixture of air and fuel is being compressed to

338
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,350
spontaneously combust and start the ignition phase

339
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:30,320
before an actual spark is put in to ignite the.

340
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,280
The fuel is controlled by. Audio engineering, this

341
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,880
is called Docketed, and you have engineers

342
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:44,380
knocking in a car, that is what happens when it's

343
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:50,170
trying to work with a. Compression ratio we want

344
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:58,190
to repeat to that is too large. For these fuels to

345
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:03,320
remain stable. This is a just brief segment in the

346
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,930
last couple of minutes here to alternate. Form of

347
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:13,910
internal combustion engine, I need to zoom out to

348
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:17,900
get into the screen. That should do it. And what

349
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,050
we have here is a cycle.

350
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,280
Known as the diesel cycle.

351
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,430
Imlach.

352
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:40,630
And similarly to the auto cycle that describes a

353
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:47,050
petrol engine we have, adiabatic compression is

354
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:52,000
going from using, if you want to be to and

355
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:57,280
idiomatic powerplays. But instead of mixing the

356
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,100
air fuel at the start, the schools are concerned

357
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,240
about what what is compressed is actually just air

358
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,570
itself, which is not going to spontaneously

359
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,930
combust, at least not if the temperature is large

360
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,840
enough to melt whatever the engine is made out of

361
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,930
the first place. It is only at this stage. Mr.

362
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:26,560
Weebles, one, two, three and four. The initial

363
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:33,490
phase is now happening at a cost and pressure. And

364
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,130
pushing the system out to a larger point where

365
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,420
fuel is actually injected into the hot air that

366
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,520
has been compressed. Where it immediately ignites,

367
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,600
increases the temperature and increases the volume

368
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:55,550
at this fixed pressure and then. It's power. Out

369
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:59,620
of. Remaining expansion back to the point where we

370
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,680
started off with. So the efficiency of the diesel

371
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,180
cycle is going to depend on both the compression

372
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:13,860
ratio, the one. Review, too, as well as what is

373
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:19,300
called the cut off ratio, which is this. New

374
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,550
volume three divided by the two how?

375
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,630
This is putting the limit on how much how high the

376
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:33,620
pressure can be as fuel is injected to be burned.

377
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:40,320
So. We have an expression for the utmost

378
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:46,490
efficiency. Given a depression ratio of.

379
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,430
Existing cars tend to have compression ratios,

380
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,780
babies, so it's going to be almost is times for

381
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:02,500
children to get into this expression of the auto

382
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,480
cycle efficiency, what is now fifty six percent

383
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,550
efficient efficiently. What's.

384
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,850
In practice, so realistic cycles, psychosis is

385
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,600
ignoring things like fiction and other

386
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:25,890
inefficiencies, the people burning fuel, so the

387
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:31,710
other cycle legalistic deficiencies are usually

388
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:36,300
about 10 to 20 percent between two to three. And

389
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,290
you can find in the diesel cycle with a fixed

390
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,290
compression ratio. The efficiency actually tends

391
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:47,490
to be less than the other cycle. But because we

392
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,700
don't have this risk of spontaneous combustion, we

393
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,160
can get much larger compression ratios at work

394
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:03,930
around 20. So two and a half times the ratio for a

395
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:08,700
petrol engine is possible with typical diesel

396
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:13,230
engines. And in those real world examples, the

397
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,590
efficiency can rise from 20 to 30 percent all the

398
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,580
way up to 40 percent, which doesn't seem to be

399
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,780
showing up well on that screen. But. Is, I think,

400
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,320
the place to stop for today in light of the time.

401
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,690
I think over the coming week, both in lecture and

402
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:37,300
tutorial, we'll do some more. Connections with.

403
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:43,470
These more realistic real world applications of

404
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,590
all the food and concepts we've been building up

405
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:53,940
in time, gas related to solar radiation, and I

406
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,910
think a tutorial will look at the Einstein model

407
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,500
of a solid.

408
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,050
It's its capacity to some experimental data.

409
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,410
So if there are no further questions for today,

410
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:14,820
we'll have a week for statistical physics. Hope

411
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:20,400
you enjoy the weekend. It remains so nice and

412
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:20,790
sunny.
