1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:09,430
All right, that should be the recording started, so let's get underway.  Welcome to Friday morning,

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:16,500
for which we have the six-digit code

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,860
two five seven six two seven.

4
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,400
And to give you a chance to

5
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:37,480
catch up with what we're doing on the grand-canonical ensemble.

6
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:40,820
So, it is the eleventh

7
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,000
of March.

8
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,160
Some of you may have seen that feedback and

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,070
solutions for the first part of the computer

10
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,360
project, I was finally able to get those back

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,870
to you earlier this week.

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,550
I think this afternoon, the tutorial will talk a bit

13
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:19,690
about some aspects of those solutions. It's a

14
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,450
tricks for. We're someone. Relevant aspects of

15
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,850
them for part two, which is also available for you

16
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,530
to work on due in a couple of weeks, 24th. Of

17
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,360
March, I think.

18
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,180
It was a. Range of performance is part one of the

19
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,990
computer project, the average was about seventy

20
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,570
three, but there was a big standard deviation on

21
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,960
that 73 percent. So divide that by two to get the

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,960
marks out of 50, then standard deviation of about

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,860
twenty three percent. So that's sort of what I was

24
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,360
aiming for, making the assignment. Relatively

25
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,280
challenging, at least for someone who does not

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,570
feel discouraged if the headline Mark looked a bit

27
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:14,950
low, go through some of the tricks for that part

28
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,440
of things. And a quick look at the second part of

29
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,920
the tutorial this afternoon. Before then, we will.

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,260
Continue developing the script multiple. Not

31
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,940
sellable. Are there any immediate questions before

32
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,450
we dive into that other down to the. Stuff we did

33
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,310
earlier this week with wrapping up the

34
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,250
thermodynamic cycles, introducing the economical

35
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,880
sample or any aspect of the computer project.

36
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,280
I'm not hearing any.

37
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,150
Quick reminder that after.

38
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,060
Wrapping up the presentation of some of the cycles

39
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,860
on Monday, again, something a bit more in the news

40
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,240
for you this afternoon, we move on to the third of

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,640
the three statistical samples that we're focusing

42
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,150
on in this module. So we started off back in

43
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,160
February with the microeconomic ensemble

44
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,560
probability space that describes the states the

45
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,050
system can adopt as it falls in time subject to

46
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,750
the constraints of conservation, energy and

47
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,690
conservation of particle. No, we could have gone

48
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,110
from there to allow these systems to exchange

49
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,630
energy with their surroundings, form of a thermal

50
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,140
reservoir that, instead of fixing the energy of

51
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,510
the system, fixes its temperature while still

52
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,830
keeping the particle number the same. They know

53
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,140
we're sort of filling in the other side of that.

54
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,840
Developments looking at the grand economic

55
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,510
ensemble, which allows the system to exchange both

56
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,390
particles and energy with its surroundings, the

57
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,250
surroundings are now treated as a particle

58
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,940
reservoir and they fix, in addition to the

59
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,360
temperature, this chemical potential view that we

60
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:26,350
defined on Tuesday. So the great ensemble is

61
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,820
defined by. Six chemical potential and temperature.

62
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,700
Where that chemical potential.

63
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,380
We define to be in negativity at times, the

64
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,670
response of the entropy to a change in the

65
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,430
particle, no, with fixed energy.

66
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,390
And we saw that this is. Less than zero, it's a

67
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,290
negative number in natural systems, which was our

68
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,400
choice to interpret the chemical potential, it's

69
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,710
leading to a flow of particles or regions of high

70
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,520
chemical potential, chemical potential analogous

71
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,790
to the flow of heat from regions of high

72
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,290
temperature to low temperature, and then to put

73
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,500
the economic ensemble on a formal mathematical

74
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:27,900
footing. We essentially repeated the. Trick that

75
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,840
we introduced when developing the economical

76
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,320
ensemble. Proposing that it's political reservoir

77
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,930
consists of many replicas of the system of

78
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,020
interest itself, and our goal then is to.

79
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,370
Breakdown.

80
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,340
Probabilities, for example, involve the

81
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,210
equilibrium on the basis of this nonsense or its

82
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:58,950
political reservoir and then show that all the

83
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:04,280
details of this nonsense are irrelevant and even

84
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,550
unknowable in the great canonical approach. So. We

85
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,050
have to come back to the lecture notes at that

86
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:20,680
point to. Just catch up with the final stages of

87
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,810
interrogation. We are imposing a dynamic

88
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,290
equilibrium by modifying, by maximizing the

89
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,170
entropy subject to the grass multipliers that

90
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,570
incorporate the constraints of the ensemble, the

91
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,950
conservation of energy between the system,

92
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,330
systematise reservoir and similarly with the

93
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,500
particle. No. And we got down to expressing the

94
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,460
three parameters that appear in this.

95
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,130
Maximization process, the sense of the expressed

96
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,520
is a function of the other two parameters, both of

97
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,700
which we related to the total energy part of the

98
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,130
number of the system, plus its reservoir, which

99
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,720
gave us a fairly simple expression for the overall

100
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,170
entropy that depends on the details of our onsets,

101
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,980
the number of replicas of the total amount of

102
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,020
energy and the number of particles and from the

103
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,090
entropy, our definition of temperature. A The

104
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,690
schedule allows us to relate the remaining

105
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,260
parameters data again to the temperature and

106
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,590
chemical potential that we're interested through

107
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,860
half of that on Tuesday, finding that this

108
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,100
parameter beta is the inverse of the temperature.

109
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,420
I deliberately stopped in the stream so that we

110
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,000
could review all of the set up and remind

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,100
ourselves why we are computing and how we are

112
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,960
computing all of these qualities. So if that recap

113
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,960
did not inspire any further questions or need for

114
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,800
clarifications.

115
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,560
Move on to the final pieces today.

116
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,710
And the. Wrap up this last derivative of the

117
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,790
entropy to find the chemical potential of our

118
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:27,190
system in terms of beta and give those. Across

119
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,220
multiple parameters coming in through the

120
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,890
maximization of the entropy, given our. Replica

121
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:41,480
trade consoles, and this is a similar calculations.

122
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,410
But what about just swapping all the respect to

123
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,680
energy for derivatives with respect to the number

124
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,180
of particles? We can. Right down.

125
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,040
TR.

126
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:07,900
Recalling that the lollygag of Z G depends on both

127
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,630
speed and gave us of expanding.

128
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,040
The derivative with respect to enter into

129
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,340
derivatives with respect to beta and gamma.

130
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,480
Of that log.

131
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:30,560
And then still with the latest fekter. Times, so

132
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:36,160
the energy is independent of the party. No. We

133
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,890
just have that energy times in the end. As always,

134
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,470
I'm keeping I'm getting some subscripts here just

135
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,070
to reduce the amount that I need to write the

136
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,250
derivative at the end with respect to them is just

137
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,370
Gaila. And then we have in the game at the end.

138
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,220
As before, this is

139
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,540
these derivatives of the mortgages that we

140
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,000
computed on Tuesday on the previous page, they're

141
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,990
the same as noted above. Minus E for the

142
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,070
derivative, with respect to the positive and the

143
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,980
derivative with respect to Gamma and the of this

144
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:28,870
sector of honesty. At the end of the end. Times

145
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:35,560
minus the. Let's give a. The end times in.

146
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,380
Plus, the way to defend.

147
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,160
And then I pulled out negative signs incorrectly

148
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,580
here.

149
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,990
It's minus seven minus and. Given the and so it

150
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,310
simplifies

151
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,050
those two terms, cancelling those two terms

152
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:15,860
against any negative, the possibility is, given

153
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,080
the times, the temperature, if we can now relate

154
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:24,270
to gather and data directly from the results from

155
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,500
Tuesday. So once the dust has settled and all of

156
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,420
these cancellations have been applied, we find the

157
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,050
same relation between this parameter data and the

158
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,660
inverse temperature that we had for the canonical

159
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,180
example. And then this new ingredient, we actually

160
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,520
got together coming along with the constraints on

161
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,040
particle exchange between the system and its

162
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,500
particle reservoir is related to the ratio of the

163
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,130
chemical potential to the temperature. And just as

164
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,700
in the case of the canonical ensemble, this is

165
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:08,110
what we were after. We have expressions for the

166
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,720
MicroTech probabilities. In terms of sense of that

167
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,830
gave a lot of which refer in any way to any

168
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:23,290
details of that particular Izibor, so we know that

169
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,490
this particular reservoir is presence to make the

170
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,470
temperature and the chemical potential

171
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,950
well-defined and fixed for ensemble, but beyond

172
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,300
its presence in its will fixing those quantities,

173
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,990
I know information about that reservoir is

174
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,210
relevant or even doable in the great economic

175
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,560
approach. And if we look at just our system of

176
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,780
interest. Every aspect of it can be expressed in

177
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,020
terms of the fixed temperature, tea and chemical

178
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,710
potential, you as promised by that. Picture we

179
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,860
looked at earlier. And having host family dynamic

180
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:09,340
equilibrium, we have this expression for the

181
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:14,220
probability for. The system to adopt any given

182
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,670
microstates will make us supplied with a given

183
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,060
internal energy supply and protocol number and

184
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,910
survive, both of which are now allowed to

185
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,840
fluctuate as the system exchanges. Particles and

186
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,740
energy with its surroundings. We can see that.

187
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,560
Thanks to one of the features of the chemical

188
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,200
potential mentioned Tuesday, the fact that it has

189
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,260
dimensions of energy, which is the same as

190
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,690
dimensions of temperature units, the arguments of

191
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,480
the exponential factor here is dimensionless says

192
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,200
it has to be.

193
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,750
And this is. Essentially a generalization of that

194
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,640
troublesome factor that drives for economical

195
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,560
ensemble to include. Now the. Role of the chemical

196
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,440
essential you.

197
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,560
Adjusting the probabilities for different

198
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,370
microstates with different numbers of particles

199
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,630
and again continuing that close analogy with the

200
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,200
canonical ensemble. All of these probabilities are

201
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,430
verbalized by this one overzealous subsidy factor,

202
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,990
which we can identify as the accountable form of

203
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:40,150
the protection function, which, as we first saw

204
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,410
for the economic, is the fundamental quantity from

205
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,520
the. Ensemble that characterizes the system at the

206
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,120
basic level from which all aspects of the system

207
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,260
that we're interested in can be derived, and we

208
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,050
found in the course of our calculation on Tuesday

209
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,540
that the specific form of the screen canonical

210
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:06,250
production function is the sum over all of the

211
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,700
microstates of the system of the same exponential

212
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,530
factor, both in terms of the inverse temperature

213
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:18,010
and the temperature itself. So it is minus.

214
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:24,730
Quantity of energy, minus types of particles, all

215
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,840
of that normalized by the temperature. So that is

216
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,600
the end of the long form of construction of the

217
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,230
canonical ensemble characterized by these

218
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,030
microsleep, probabilities and projection function.

219
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,400
So we can now go on to do some interesting things,

220
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,110
seeing how we derive quantities based on this

221
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,280
foundation. Are there any questions about what

222
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:00,380
we've done so far in order to obtain? This basic

223
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:00,940
definition.

224
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,370
Like I said, much the same way that the

225
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,810
construction of the grand ensemble was done so far.

226
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:22,110
Mirrors our work on the economical example, we can

227
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,220
continue in that vein, looking at the same sort of

228
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,220
manipulations of the petition function that proves

229
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,800
useful for the canonical ensemble.

230
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,270
Which in particular?

231
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,090
Revolve around the logarithm of this screenshot of

232
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,480
a petition function, the same object that we saw

233
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,080
popping up in terms of replicas as we were going

234
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,830
through this derivation of.

235
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,270
The relation between the temperature of the

236
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,290
potential and the multipliers we saw that the.

237
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,510
Derivatives, with respect to those parameters in

238
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,740
Indiana of the law other than that of this grand

239
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,100
non-competition function, played a central role.

240
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,250
And.

241
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,480
Now that we have seen that the can be defined

242
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,380
completely independently of any that's for that

243
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:33,800
large. Particle reservoir. The reinterprets. Those

244
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,160
sorts of relations to look at some of the basic

245
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,370
sets of commodities like the energy and the

246
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,570
expectation value of the internal energy and now

247
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,050
adding to that, the expectation value of the

248
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,780
number of particles. So even though both the

249
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,050
internal energy and the number of particles in our

250
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,440
system are allowed to fluctuate in the Green

251
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,520
Kalikow approach. The expectation value is for

252
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,330
both of those qualities. Are building materials

253
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,530
that.

254
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,130
Followed so they depend only on the temperature

255
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,560
and chemical potential now with deliberation about

256
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,810
the reservoir and the basic definition of any

257
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,350
expectation value. As we've seen many times now is

258
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:27,250
this sum over all of the microstates of the

259
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,240
quantity of interest, such as the internal energy

260
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,320
weighted by the probability that we found for the

261
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,440
course of the microstates now expressed in terms

262
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,460
of the partition function in this exponential

263
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:49,720
factor. Similarly for. The average number. And

264
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:54,490
we've seen already that. This sort of some over

265
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,780
microstates of energy, a particle, no, we by the

266
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:04,720
probabilities is. Related to derivatives of the

267
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,240
logarithm of that great medical protection

268
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,140
function. Just the way that the entropy, an

269
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,410
internal energy and the canonical example were

270
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,480
related to the speed energy, the.

271
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,830
Voyeurism of acknowledgeable protection function,

272
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,340
so the analagous quality in the grand canonical

273
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,970
approach is known as the grand canonical potential

274
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,050
defined in essentially the same way as the help of

275
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,920
three energy, the factor of negative temperature

276
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,880
times, the logarithm of the screen canonical

277
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:50,380
protection function. Which allows us to. Rewrites

278
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,050
both the partition function itself and the

279
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,800
probabilities in a somewhat more compact form. So

280
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,410
in writing this relation equations. Seventy five.

281
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,220
Justin tells us that the petition function is the

282
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,370
exponential of the negative of this great economic

283
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,500
potential, the temperature inflated that into the

284
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,340
equation, 70 for the microsleep probabilities

285
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,880
gives us an overall exponential factor. Looking at

286
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,100
the difference between. This potential internal

287
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,950
energy and chemical potential Times article no,

288
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,880
again, although the normalized by the temperature.

289
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,700
Just to highlight the similarity between this

290
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,490
incredible potential and the Helmholtz free energy

291
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,990
case, I'll mention that

292
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,590
some of the resources for this Vijayawada may

293
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,920
sometimes see this quantity called the Landfried

294
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,180
Energy is the highlights of similarity with the

295
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:05,840
Helmholtz. And continuing on to develop this

296
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,370
similarity, we can expect that derivatives of this

297
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,770
potential are going to be related to those

298
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,920
quantities of interest that we will want to

299
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,320
compute for any given system in the economic

300
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:27,560
approach. The simplest one of these to consider is

301
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,760
looking at the derivative with respect to the

302
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,640
chemical potential. So. Reading this in terms of

303
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,020
beta.

304
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,630
The. Phenomenal potential is the water level of

305
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,340
the patrician function divided by negative data.

306
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,440
So that is.

307
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,810
What this derivative refers to and then.

308
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,870
Going through the chain rule for the derivative of

309
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:15,460
the law, it will become a factor one over. ZG. And

310
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,180
we call them that. The protection function,

311
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,430
something overall, microstates we can move inside

312
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,480
the cell and just apply it to the exponential

313
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,800
factor negatively, the Times, Microsoft Energy

314
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,060
minus new Times Microsleep particle number. So

315
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,040
that derivative of the exponential is just

316
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,590
bringing down a factor of positive Balewa times.

317
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:49,970
And so by the Betas will cancel out. We will be

318
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:54,440
left with the sum of the particle number for each

319
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,510
microstates weighted by the same. Exponential

320
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,130
factor.

321
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:11,440
Which we can recognize. As. The negative.

322
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:21,920
Go ahead. The call that the microsleep probability

323
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:28,070
is over 70 times the exponential factor that we

324
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,580
have.

325
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,740
She just barely fits in there, so this is the

326
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:41,020
negative sum over microstates of times like this

327
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,920
in our ability or in other words, the expectation

328
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,230
value of the party with No.

329
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,750
For the system in the medical approach.

330
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:03,690
So that is accounting for one of the.

331
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,370
Quantities of interest that we will want to

332
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,030
consider for any given system be analyzed through

333
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,450
the economic cycle starting. Next week.

334
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:25,190
Most likely. The other qualities are the average

335
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:29,750
internal energy and the entropy. Which we can

336
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,100
expect to be related to derivatives with respect

337
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,030
to the temperature rather than with respect to the

338
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:44,640
chemical potential. So. Going through the.

339
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,500
The delegates calculation that we looked at that

340
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,960
three for the canonical ensemble. We can

341
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,980
anticipate that just collecting the temperature

342
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,050
derivative of the logarithm of the opposition

343
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,370
function itself is worth doing in advance.

344
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:12,850
And this is, again, something of a. Welcome back

345
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:16,180
to right in terms of the temperature below

346
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:21,760
plugging in. The relation between. Temperature

347
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,670
derivatives, an inverse temperature evidence that

348
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,380
we drive toward a black.

349
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,330
We can expand the war with the partition function

350
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,930
the same way as above and move that derivative

351
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:41,440
with respect to make it all inside. Some of her

352
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,310
microstates.

353
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,860
That involves so that is, again, just the

354
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,140
derivative with respect to. Data of our usual

355
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,960
exponential factor, which is now going to bring

356
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,110
down. The negative quantity immodestly in.

357
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,740
So that cancel out the negatives have a of squared.

358
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,360
And then something over on microstates, Eastby,

359
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,910
minus you and Savi.

360
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:28,050
Exponential. Factor remaining, which is. The

361
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,760
expectation value of the internal energy system

362
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,880
overall, microstates of Eastby Times piece of.

363
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,370
Minus the constant chemical essential plants, that

364
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:48,570
same expectation value of the. Particle number.

365
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,480
All of that divided by. T squared reprovingly

366
00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:01,070
multiplied by it being a squared. So then putting

367
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,640
this result into the full derivative of the great

368
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:07,650
potential.

369
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,230
We have just a trivial derivative of the

370
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,490
temperature with respect to temperature is a

371
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,390
negative log of the protection function.

372
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:35,790
Then minus two times the derivative of the log of

373
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,540
that subsidy. With respect to temperature, which

374
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:44,090
is exactly what we computed in the first half of

375
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,720
this gap, this difference between expectation

376
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:55,780
value is divided by two squared. So can you really

377
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,030
write down the answer for. This derivative of the

378
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,990
great economic potential negatives, more of the

379
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:09,970
petition function. Minus one factor in temperature

380
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:15,760
at times. The. Expectation value of the internal

381
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,280
energy of the system.

382
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:23,350
And then plus that, better times, chemical

383
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,580
potential, new friends, the expectation value of

384
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:33,970
the particle, no. Or if we recall that. The

385
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,220
economic potential by this negative negativity.

386
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:45,060
Times the wall of censorship, and we can rewrite

387
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,890
this expression as.

388
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,130
Fire itself with not a potential.

389
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,860
Which will be divided by team to get the law of

390
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:04,420
Senshi and a similar division, Bayati is present

391
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:10,510
in all the other terms. In other words, this

392
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:16,410
combination of. Real economic potential, energy

393
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,900
expectation value, political expectations that is

394
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:23,010
related to 10 times the partial derivative with

395
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,340
respect to temperature of the ground about the

396
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:29,730
full potential itself, which is written a bit more

397
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:36,500
cleanly in the text on the next page. If you

398
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,580
multiply through.

399
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,710
We'll get to that location in just a bit. What we

400
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:54,150
have now is the final basic quantity to drive in

401
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,710
the economical approaches, the entropy itself.

402
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:07,460
And just as we did. In the economical case, we

403
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,330
have a general expression for the interview as

404
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,510
this product of microsleep of times, there was

405
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,900
some deverall microstates, the negative sign and

406
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,220
we just need to insert.

407
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,410
Because I probability probabilities for the

408
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,280
grandmotherhood Wythenshawe that we computed at

409
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,200
the beginning of today and trick here again is to.

410
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,830
Just do that substitution for one of these two

411
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:44,290
factors of the probability. So you keep the

412
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:48,700
negative sum over all microstates. Of those

413
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:54,330
microsleep, probabilities times the logarithm. Of

414
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,140
the probability itself, and I'll just right here

415
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,180
for reference. But over the weekend on the

416
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,800
competition, a function of the to speed up Eli

417
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:13,230
minus. And so we have. Applying the logarithm to

418
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:19,980
that factor, a negative log. That's G. And along

419
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,940
with the exponential of negative, better times,

420
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,930
the internal energy for. Because they make it so I

421
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,040
mean, plus the times, new times, the corresponding

422
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,420
particle, no.

423
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:46,140
And recalling that. So over all probability, this

424
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,830
has to add up to one. With this mortgage factor

425
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:56,720
being a constant that some just gives us a new one

426
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,550
coming along for the ride. So we have more of the

427
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:06,020
petition function, the song over is weighted by

428
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,340
the probabilities is again, the internal energy

429
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,360
expectation value with the overall factor of.

430
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,930
Positive on the. Negative signs cancel out and

431
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,410
then similarly, the storm over the particle number

432
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:27,740
for democracy weighted by democracy with an

433
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:34,050
overall negative sign of the times, new times. The

434
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,970
expectation, Don, for part of the longest. Which

435
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:43,320
is exactly the negative of the derivative we have

436
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,970
just computed of the great potential which is

437
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,980
attached to the temperature of.

438
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,000
Devi. Team.

439
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:07,410
Over the past few pages, we have derived. A whole

440
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:11,970
set of interconnected relations between that great

441
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,140
potential that. Packages are the partition

442
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,670
function or basic starting point and the general

443
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:26,440
set of. Derives qualities that we tend to be

444
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,890
interested in computing for. And if you insist on

445
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,100
the mechanical approach, the entropy, the internal

446
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,950
energy, expectation value, the expectation value

447
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:40,030
of the particle and the relation between that

448
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,790
great potential and all three of those qualities

449
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,910
that we get by multiplying.

450
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:53,040
The situation up here through by. The temperature

451
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,820
right here on the left hand side here is the

452
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,940
negative entropy is beginning to realize that this

453
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,060
is the great economic potential itself.

454
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,970
Up to plus factors of the expectation value, the

455
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:14,470
internal energy and minus the chemical potential

456
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,780
times the expectation value of the number of

457
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,760
particles. So these are the results that we have

458
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:27,760
some time driving. Are there any questions about

459
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:32,500
other aspects of those derivations or the meanings

460
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,870
of the results of relations that we now have for

461
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,630
the grand canonical ensemble?

462
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:54,680
Hands are shaking, so we will wrap up this. Kind

463
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:59,210
of for the governments of the ensemble with just

464
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:05,120
one last application of particular, this last

465
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,150
relation between all three of these large

466
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:12,080
quantities and the economic potential, and then.

467
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,960
Possibly start getting into. On the first

468
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,870
application of the draft document sample that we

469
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,380
will be doing now that we have all the pieces in

470
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:30,080
place over the fall as it developed, we can.

471
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,440
Observers from the final equation, seventy-nine

472
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:40,920
collected in this box here that. We now have.

473
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,630
Extended into the earlier connection that we had

474
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:51,350
in the canonical example relating the free energy,

475
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:58,020
the internal energy and entropy. Which back in

476
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:03,930
previous units. Give us a. Full expression for

477
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:07,560
that first law of thermodynamics, which describes

478
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,410
how. Any changes in the internal energy of our

479
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,290
system have to be compensated by corresponding

480
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:20,840
changes in the political order. It is in contact

481
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:26,420
with. So just as a celebration of simplification

482
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:32,600
for the remainder of today, we will drop the

483
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,750
expectation values on the internal energy particle.

484
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:39,920
No, just reading them as the in, though, keeping

485
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,510
in mind that these are the large scale properties

486
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:48,260
of the macroscopic system. So the thermodynamic

487
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:54,750
observables rather than. The. Fluctuating internal

488
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,560
energy, the number is and supply corresponding to

489
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,590
individual microstates. So the first law of

490
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:10,110
thermodynamics that we. Drive last week related

491
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:14,750
the change in this internal energy to two factors

492
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:20,400
that we define as heat and work. The heat

493
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,360
exchanger, thermal energy from the system and its

494
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,450
surroundings was expressed as the temperature

495
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,200
explains the change in the entropy of the system.

496
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:37,170
Breastwork. We identified as the change in energy

497
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,400
due to the application of force was the pressure

498
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,910
of the system multiplied by the negative change in

499
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:49,440
volume caused by that force. So decrease in the

500
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,450
volume at fixed pressure increases the internal

501
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,880
inertia of the system.

502
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,890
We now have the ability to exchange particles

503
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,320
between the system and its surroundings.

504
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:11,250
A new variable that the entropy can depend on, the

505
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:14,530
particle number is no longer fixed and if we

506
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,690
consider in general expanding and the change in

507
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:24,080
the entropy. In terms of these three parameters,

508
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,000
the internal energy volume of the system, such as

509
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:34,030
the gas or the particle, no. We pick up this

510
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,810
verbal expression for how changes in each of those

511
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:41,530
three qualities relate to the overall change in

512
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:45,790
entropy through the response to the entropy, to

513
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,370
the corresponding quantity with the other two held

514
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:51,400
fixed. So the derivative of entropy with respect

515
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,820
to energy, fixing the volume of particle number.

516
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,260
Similarly. With the change in volume and the

517
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:06,820
change in political level. And we saw. Several

518
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,310
times now previously, with this response of

519
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:12,310
entropy to the internal energy is nothing more

520
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:15,520
than the inverse temperature. And at the start of

521
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,120
this unit, we define the corresponding response to

522
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,900
the entropy to change a particle, to be the

523
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,370
negative chemical potential divided by temperature.

524
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:33,880
And this last person with that is left here and

525
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:38,710
derivative of entropy with respect to volume we

526
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,960
can relate to.

527
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,610
Usual thermodynamic properties by. Stepping back

528
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:51,060
to the case, the first law of thermodynamics with

529
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,170
a fixed particle, no.

530
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,500
That is given as one of the conditions on this

531
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:57,890
partially.

532
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,960
And the other condition that the internal energy

533
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:09,900
is fixed is that is change. It's zero, and that

534
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,730
relates. The heat and the work in this case, the

535
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,640
fixed part of a no fixed internal energy and

536
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:25,070
rearranging this. Infinitesimal expression. You

537
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:30,130
find that the. Be attributed to a change in the

538
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:34,850
volume. Again, with fixed internal energy particle,

539
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:39,470
no, it's given by the ratio of the pressure to the

540
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:44,030
temperature, and so we arranged to move to the

541
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:46,520
other side of the equation, divide it through by

542
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:53,490
temperature and by changing the volume. So this

543
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,630
issue of pressure and temperature in to that final.

544
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:07,060
Partial derivatives you had written down at the

545
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,660
bottom of this page here and then rearranged to

546
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,780
isolate the change in energy by multiplying

547
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,040
through five the temperature that is appearing in

548
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,650
the denominator of every term of the right hand

549
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:27,130
side, we recover the previous form of the first,

550
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,370
the networks that we derived, canonical ensemble

551
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,850
change in internal energy. Is related to the heat

552
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:39,340
exchanged with this round? Plus, the mechanical

553
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,340
work that is done on the system by the

554
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,940
surroundings and then the new term is the chemical

555
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,820
potential times change in particle number,

556
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,330
sometimes referred to as chemical work, the change

557
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:58,200
in energy that results. From a change in the total

558
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,980
number of chemicals in our system through exchange

559
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,390
with the surroundings.

560
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:11,180
You can again see the role of the chemical

561
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:15,200
potential and its dimensions of energy leading a

562
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,260
change in the pure number, the number of particles

563
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:23,380
to change the overall energy of the system. So

564
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,860
this is a further generalization of that, first of

565
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:27,210
all.

566
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,860
They called the generalized thermodynamic identity,

567
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:37,960
which provides an easy way to either remember or

568
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,900
redivide of relations between.

569
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,230
Six of these. Macroscopic properties of the system,

570
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,770
the temperature, chemical potential, energy,

571
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,980
entropy, avoiding the particle numbers. If we

572
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:03,740
imagine fixing any two of those qualities, we come

573
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,430
up with a relation between the other four. So as

574
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:12,620
an example. If we fix the particle number and the

575
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:16,430
volume, then this equation of the General Assembly

576
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,110
identity collapses back down to the definition of

577
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:24,470
the temperature, the very first derived quantity

578
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:32,110
that we. Introduced all the way back to the so the

579
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:36,110
second and third terms vanish by fixing and fixing

580
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:39,480
while you're left with just a change in energy

581
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,400
equal to temperature. Times change entropy, which

582
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,870
we can rearrange to identify the inverse

583
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:49,820
temperature as the response of the entropy to a

584
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,550
change in energy with everything else fixed.

585
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,710
Is. Swapping things around so that only the second

586
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:03,100
term can be identity is not zero. So fixing the

587
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:07,060
particle number and considering isotropic

588
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:11,370
processes that keep the entropy constant, we

589
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:16,720
recover the definition for the pressure that we

590
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,830
introduced in. Unit four, I believe we can get all

591
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:26,770
the gases, the negative response to the internal

592
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:29,950
energy to change the volume for fixed particle

593
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:34,600
number and constant intravenous. And the new

594
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,930
relation that we now have from the general, that

595
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,060
is if we continue considering isotropic processes

596
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:49,610
with constant entropy and now a fixed volume, but

597
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:53,110
allow the number to change, we can get a.

598
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,350
New way of looking at or understanding what the

599
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:03,310
chemical potential means in physical terms, that's

600
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,300
just as the two examples above that we've already

601
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,760
seen you find the chemical potential is the

602
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,540
response in the energy and we change the particle

603
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:17,080
number if we keep the volume of the system fixed

604
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,480
and also require that the entropy remain constant

605
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,160
in this process.

606
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:31,570
Now, at the start of this unit earlier this week,

607
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:38,500
we argued that if we add particles to a system, we

608
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,140
can generically expect the intricate system to

609
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:44,350
increase. So qualitatively at the hardware level,

610
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:47,590
with more particles, there are more ways of

611
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:50,470
arranging those particles. More microstates has

612
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,720
more energy, entropy or more information. So

613
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,740
generically, if we. Increase the number of we

614
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,590
expect the country to increase and in order to

615
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:07,190
keep the interview fixed when adding particles,

616
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,460
you would then need to adjust the energy of the

617
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,770
system to cancel out. That increased.

618
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:19,400
Decrease the entropy by a corresponding amount,

619
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,930
cancel out the change we will typically get from

620
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:26,690
increasing the number of particles. So what that

621
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,990
means, in short, is that limit the number of

622
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:35,180
particles increases. For isotropic process, we

623
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,070
need to decrease the energy.

624
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,780
So that was pretty primitive here that we have not

625
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,820
related to the chemical potential is going to be

626
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,110
negative. So this is. Just a.

627
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:59,050
New way of looking at understanding of the.

628
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:04,730
Results that we discussed where we had the

629
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,460
potential to introduce a introduced on Tuesday

630
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,820
that it is in generally negative quality for

631
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,510
natural systems with positive temperatures.

632
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:20,220
And that is. Sort of the end of the formal

633
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:24,060
introduction of the grand total ensemble. So a

634
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:29,730
good place to start for today. Just to recap what

635
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:32,400
we have done, we finished going through that

636
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,600
replica trick, seeing that the details of the

637
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,820
particle reservoir fixed the temperature and

638
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,130
chemical essential for the great canonical

639
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:45,810
ensemble are irrelevant and unknowable and then

640
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:49,800
derived by introducing the chemical, the

641
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,250
derivative of the logarithm of the partition

642
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:58,180
function and related derivatives of that economic

643
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:02,260
potential to the standard set of divided

644
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,700
quantities that we tend to be interested in an

645
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,300
average particle, no average internal energy, and

646
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:12,090
the entropy which led us to this generalized to

647
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,960
the identity, the generalization of the first law

648
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,160
of thermodynamics, to the canonical case in which

649
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,460
the particle number is allowed to change along

650
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:27,300
with the internal energy and potentially the

651
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:27,800
volume.

652
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:36,290
So this is a last call for immediate questions

653
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:40,850
about what we have gone through today in. And as

654
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:44,720
you consider those on this forecast, the next step,

655
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:47,660
which will be applying all of this formalism that

656
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,870
we have spent the past couple of classes

657
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:56,820
developing to the case of quantum field cases, and

658
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,820
it will be just a bit more build up to. Work

659
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:06,100
through those applications starting on Monday by

660
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:10,460
looking at. The definition of quantum statistics

661
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:15,190
and how this differs from the non quantum or

662
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,670
classical. Systems that we have been considering

663
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,570
up to this point in the module, so that is what we

664
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:26,980
can look forward to next week. I have office hours

665
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:31,230
now. There are questions about the solutions to

666
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,550
part one of the computer project or the feedback

667
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:38,350
that can check through that, which also will look

668
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:42,570
through briefly in the tutorial this afternoon. So

669
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,100
obviously, I'll see you all there. If not, I'll

670
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:46,950
see you on Monday afternoon.

671
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:54,520
Yeah, so.

672
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,230
Stop the recording.
