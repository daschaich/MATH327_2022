1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:06,110
That's the recording started, and this is

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,910
the code for this morning:

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,170
Nine four, zero zero, one five.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,530
Are there any immediate questions before we resume

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,650
working up to quantum gases in the grand

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,810
canonical ensemble?

7
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,240
It's been a few days since we were last in this

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,450
place in the notes.  So let's just quickly catch up with

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:56,280
the plan for Friday the 18th of March.

10
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,820
It's now one week before the final part of the

11
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,960
computer project is due. We may get into that in the

12
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,410
tutorial this afternoon, rather than this morning.

13
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,400
We are building up to quantum gases

14
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,580
in the grand canonical ensemble.

15
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,990
And so far this week, and for at least the first

16
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,170
part of today, this has led us to.

17
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,840
Focus on the details of. Monthly statistics, as

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,580
opposed to classical statistics we dealt with

19
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,230
earlier in the term.

20
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,300
And the distinguishing factor here is that rather

21
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,650
than going over the household energy is that each

22
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,370
single particle can have in a more physical system

23
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:07,340
with many particles. We want to define microstates.

24
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,130
From the.

25
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,210
Occupation numbers of energy levels. I'm just

26
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,730
trying to see how much I can fit on the screen

27
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,140
here.

28
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,080
So.

29
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,040
Rather than. Coming up with a single particle.

30
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,060
Protection function and then combining all of

31
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,210
those for overcounting in the case of the missing

32
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,230
particles, we consider the energy levels of our

33
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,200
system and some over all of the possible

34
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,820
occupation numbers that those energy levels can

35
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,940
have. And we have gone through now two different

36
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,940
cases. Particles known as Bozo's compared to.

37
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,550
Those known as Hermione's, different possible

38
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,160
occupation numbers.

39
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,710
And the book is on a case number of particles and

40
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,560
energy level l can be any negative integer zero

41
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,910
one, two, three off to infinity in the thermionic

42
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,450
case.

43
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,050
There is only.

44
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,100
Possibility of having a single particle in any

45
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,750
given energy level, identical formulas have to

46
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,100
simultaneously compute and a. compute and we are

47
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,190
now in the process of. Checking that the resulting

48
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,340
quantum statistics.

49
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,100
Reduces to the classical result be drives the

50
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,100
start of the week in the classical women's.

51
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,880
I had the screen just to start the claim that this

52
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,030
classical element corresponded to high

53
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,710
temperatures, so many questions come up going

54
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,520
through that quick recap to get back to left off.

55
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,850
Three days ago from.

56
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,200
15TH to the 18th, this claim was a fairly

57
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,160
qualitative argument that the classical limit is

58
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,060
the high temperature regime. Rather than the low

59
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,520
temperature regime where we should expect quantum

60
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,470
of classical statistics to disagree. I did just

61
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,380
give a heuristic argument for this, and what we

62
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,850
can do to satisfy ourselves with this argument is

63
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:15,630
in fact correct, is actually analyze the. Three

64
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,680
sets of statistics that we've derived in the great

65
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,950
canonical ensemble at these high temperatures,

66
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,730
some of the back syllables of the classical

67
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,660
statistics, the Einstein and quantum statistics of

68
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,360
bosons and the family, Dirac quantum statistics

69
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,850
and fermions and aim to see whether our

70
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,460
expectation or claim that all three of these

71
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,700
become consistent in the high-temperature

72
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,390
classical limit is in fact, correct. The subtlety

73
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:52,960
here is. What can happen with the political No.

74
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:00,410
At high temperatures. It is possible to.

75
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,150
End up with an uncontrolled number of particles in

76
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,330
the grand economic ensemble. We have to be careful

77
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,480
to consider the appropriate high-temperature limit

78
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,760
so that we are really comparing physical systems

79
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,900
that don't have a divergence number of particles.

80
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,790
And to illustrate this problem, which may not be

81
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,310
obvious with the state, you will see what what

82
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,920
happens going through the calculation for these

83
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,340
three sets of statistics that are reproduced here

84
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,750
just for convenience in the form of. They cranking

85
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,810
out competition functions from which everything

86
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,990
else is derived and starting from each of these

87
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,430
cases, we want to go through the calculation that

88
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:56,160
we introduced. In Unit six, in the great ensemble

89
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,490
to compute the average particle numbers as a

90
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,530
function of the fixed temperature and chemical

91
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,450
potential of each of these systems and putting all

92
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,660
three of these canonical production functions

93
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,030
together. Can highlight both their similarities

94
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:21,280
and differences. Hopefully that improves the focus

95
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,880
slightly. All three of them depend on this

96
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,360
exponential factor, a generalization of the

97
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,450
Boltwood factor that now includes the ratio of

98
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,840
chemical potential to temperature one over data,

99
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,330
as well as the energy for each energy level level

100
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:45,430
by. And in all three cases, we see that. The man

101
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,540
attracting the ideal computation factories is just

102
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:56,380
a simple product of a factory for each energy

103
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,560
level, that depends only on the energy of that

104
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,550
energy level. The difference comes from exactly

105
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,410
how these exponential factors are being multiplied

106
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,960
together in the classical maximalism case. We

107
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,170
actually have the exponential of the exponential.

108
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,330
Which changes to this geometric series, one over

109
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,540
one minus the exponential for those I statistics

110
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,570
and just a simple factor of one, plus the

111
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,720
exponential and the very direct chaos due to the

112
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,960
restrictions of the occupation numbers for

113
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,000
fermions. And in all three of these cases, it is.

114
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,850
Very easy to break down the great economic

115
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,850
potential, so we call it this is the negative

116
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,120
temperature times, the logarithm of deportation

117
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,530
function. So all we have to do is take the

118
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,710
logarithm of these three expressions is converting

119
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,580
the law into the product of factors, too. If some

120
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,910
of the log of each factor and recognize that the

121
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,330
void is exponential is just its arguments. So we

122
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,030
have put an actual goals in case the overall

123
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:13,160
factor of minus two times the arguments. Of that,

124
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,110
more be exponential now summed over all of these

125
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:24,630
energy levels level from zero to al. In the case,

126
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,750
the war involved one over a factor is the negative

127
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,090
marks, the negative signs cancel out a positive

128
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,720
temperature. Times the sun over these laws with a

129
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,010
relative negative sign in front of the exponential

130
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,070
factor in the case. There is no additional

131
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,920
negative sign to cancel out the negativity from

132
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,220
the definition of the potential. So there's an

133
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,980
overall negative sign, but a relative plus sign in

134
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,120
front of the exponential.

135
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,120
So. These are.

136
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,030
The intermediate stage to the actual calculation

137
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,450
of the average particle over which we derived the

138
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,200
Section six point three to be just a negative

139
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,920
partial derivative of these great potentials with

140
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,450
respect to the chemical potential. And we can go

141
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,260
through this calculation in this gap here

142
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,720
for convenience. The key to the great logical

143
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,760
potential from the previous page. In order to just

144
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,120
take this derivative. Inside of the sun over

145
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,580
energy levels. So that brings down a positive

146
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,030
factor of beta keeping them the same exponential

147
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,870
term in the latest data entry level, 9:00 a.m.

148
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,780
beta is in room temperature. So those two factors

149
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,500
cancel out.

150
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:05,050
And for. Convenience. I'm going to write this as a

151
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:12,700
some of E to the minus X, so defining this X of L

152
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,340
to be a factor beta minus use of particular,

153
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,020
rewriting that all the time.

154
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,960
In this competition at the next. The next

155
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,370
computations do become. Bit more. Nontrivial,

156
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,450
though. Also for later convenience.

157
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,730
OK, go ahead and write the exponential with the

158
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,470
negative argument that's going over exponential

159
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:48,060
with the positive arguments. So sum over overall,

160
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,430
the energy levels of one divided by the

161
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,690
exponential factor of the speed of times energy

162
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,620
minus chemical potential. And something similar

163
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,060
looking will pop up when we go through the

164
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,180
exercise of taking these derivatives of the log in

165
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,200
the bull's eye, something that can be tracked

166
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,180
cases.

167
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,260
And the on this case. We have another negative

168
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,780
sign coming in from the definition of a particle

169
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:27,040
over here, so that overall factor of minus T up

170
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,260
front the silver and the derivative of the wallaga

171
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,910
will give us. One of the arguments of that log is

172
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,970
either the negative Exell moved through the

173
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,350
chamber or. Putting the derivatives through into

174
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,090
that negative exponential term of each of the plus

175
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:56,250
data times you. Is going to bring down the overall

176
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,870
negative side, the positive data, then exponential.

177
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:05,400
Of negative axonal and again, temperature and the

178
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,880
temperature cancel out, we can divide through by.

179
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,740
E to the power supply to get the sun over energy

180
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:22,060
levels of one over the positive minus one. So just

181
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,580
differing by. Subtracting one compared to the

182
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,920
results in the Maximalism case.

183
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,120
And it's pretty similar for this final tribute to

184
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,190
Rick statistics looking at the average particle,

185
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:45,560
No. In the case of fermions, we now have a

186
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,100
different negative sign out front and as well as a

187
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,980
different negative sign coming from the. Factor in

188
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,430
front of this exponential. So it's a positive beta

189
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:03,580
e to the minus Excel over one plus minus X now

190
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,100
canceling things out and dividing through by the

191
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,380
exponential factor as above Eataly, plus X plus

192
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,370
one. So differing from the business case only by

193
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:26,370
the relative sine. In the denominator. And. One,

194
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,580
that. Notable or useful feature of all three of

195
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,720
these results is that they are coming out as the

196
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,140
sum over energy levels of something that depends

197
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,860
on just the energy corresponding to the sea level.

198
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:47,960
So we can find this to be. The average occupation

199
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,740
number for each particular energy level is that

200
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,070
with the lower case and rather than the upper case

201
00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:00,140
and. So this is the average number of particles

202
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,370
that is in each energy level, something from the

203
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,030
ground state level zero up to the maximum level,

204
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,840
which not surprisingly, gives the overall average

205
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,740
number of particles in the system as a whole.

206
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:22,900
And. You should put a label on here somewhere on

207
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,560
the inside, the expectation that I call that next

208
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,400
wolfmen. This is similarly the. Average occupation

209
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,340
number is a function of energy level, the Einstein

210
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:44,460
case and the. Similar average occupation, no very

211
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,590
direct statistics.

212
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:54,180
So finding that. The overall occupation number

213
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,350
factorization is somewhere over the average

214
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,510
occupation, one year for each energy level to

215
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:07,380
extract the average occupation numbers in the

216
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:13,380
three cases restored by the Times is available on

217
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:18,570
this chemical potential. I was just calling on the

218
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:24,360
calculation to save something. And see that.

219
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,400
There is a.

220
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,650
Compelling degree of similarity between all three

221
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,800
of these results, the classical case just has this

222
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,940
one over exponential factor compared to the pros

223
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,510
on the very different quantum cases that add or

224
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,650
subtract one from the exponential of the

225
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,290
denominator of the average occupation number.

226
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,970
A few things we can do about this is that in this

227
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,220
case, all that varies from energy level to energy

228
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,180
level is the value of the energy. This is of how

229
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:12,870
and when the EFL is. Say, combined with the

230
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,200
potential to make a very large positive number

231
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,860
multiplied by the positive temperature, we get a

232
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,040
very large exponential factor and the overall

233
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,600
occupation number vanishes, goes down to zero as

234
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,240
one of a very large number, but the opposite

235
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,510
limits. The argument to the exponential is a

236
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,260
negative number that as long as the magnitude that

237
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,640
exponential is negligible, it goes to zero

238
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,790
compared to this one. And we find a maximum value

239
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:50,740
for the Iraq occupation of Iraq of one in case

240
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,490
where that exponential factor approaches. Zero or

241
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,230
so. No.

242
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,890
And that connects to it's not set here, but that

243
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,870
connects to the convergence of the geometric

244
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,140
series that we saw on Tuesday when coming up with

245
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,590
the expression for the bull's eye protection

246
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:19,960
function where. Let's have that reproduced here.

247
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:25,820
We can pull that up. The other piece in those

248
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,380
notes.

249
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,000
Well, we found that.

250
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,560
At the top of this page, ninety seven thousand

251
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,990
eighty five, the Bose Einstein statistics only

252
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,460
converges when this exponential factor is less

253
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,820
than one. Or equivalently, the energy has to be

254
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,600
larger than the chemical essential for every

255
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:59,260
energy left. And if we plug in that results to the

256
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,720
occupation number that we have now,

257
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,420
give us

258
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,900
the requirement that the energy always be larger

259
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:16,740
than the chemical potential. Guarantees that the

260
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,500
argument of the exponential is. Greater than zero,

261
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,240
so the explanation itself is greater than one, and

262
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,010
there's no divergence coming in from. The

263
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,420
denominator can be both Einstein occupation number.

264
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,340
Which you will also see.

265
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:43,070
In graphical form. So from the definition of a

266
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,440
potential protection function for those on

267
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,080
assistance, we guarantee that.

268
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,230
This divergence that would happen if the

269
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,330
exponential factor were to equal one is avoided.

270
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,050
So that is an excellent question connecting to

271
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,180
what we saw a few days ago.

272
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,450
For the purposes of today, though, we're

273
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,200
interested in the classical events where we want

274
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,680
all three of these different types of statistics

275
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,860
to introduce the same predictions, at least

276
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,150
approximately to show that the quantum physics

277
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,250
that we expect to be on underlying fundamental

278
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,240
level is reproducing the large scale classical

279
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,090
statistics. That was developed many years before

280
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:40,620
quantum physics was even. Imagine, and it's really

281
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,540
easy to see from putting things together like this

282
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,710
that. It is possible to get all three of these

283
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,770
average occupation numbers to be approximately

284
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,940
equal when the exponential factor is much larger

285
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,780
than one, so that's exponential plus one or minus

286
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,290
one or exponential zero, approximately the same.

287
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,520
And the corresponding average occupation numbers

288
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,060
are also. Approximately the same, and this does

289
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:16,830
connect to. How we started off this unit by saying

290
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,560
that quantum statistics arises where it becomes

291
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:25,550
important when. The probability for two particles

292
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,400
to occupy multiple particles to occupy the same

293
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,340
energy level is not trivial, which screws up the

294
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,820
overcounting corrections in the case of individual

295
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,690
particles that we could do classically with these

296
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,510
large exponential factors in the denominators. All

297
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,160
of these average occupation numbers are very small.

298
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,270
So the probability of having a large number of

299
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,870
particles in any energy level in any microstates

300
00:21:54,470 --> 00:22:00,670
is also very small. So we are in the classical

301
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,800
regime where we can expect to your energy level to

302
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,070
have at least one party going into those cases

303
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,080
zero. But there is something weird going on

304
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,630
connected to the subject. What about the service

305
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:20,990
today, which is that what we have identified as

306
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,080
the classical limit? Is where this argument to the

307
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,200
exponential Betis heightens the difference between

308
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,260
the energy level and chemical potential is much

309
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,580
larger than one.

310
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,290
Which if we recall that the is the signature.

311
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,240
Seems to look like a very small temperature to get

312
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:49,360
this ratio much larger than what? At least if we

313
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,960
imagine that the numerator is some fixed quantity

314
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,190
for a the energy level, it can make this ratio

315
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:01,420
very small by making sort of make the ratio very

316
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,530
large and the temperature on denominator a small.

317
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,870
And if we were to instead of the. Take the knife,

318
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,970
high temperature limits Sebadoh point zero again

319
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,000
with this fixed difference between the energy and

320
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,270
chemical potential than the average population,

321
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:28,340
numbers we have up here would be one. In the case

322
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,430
of natural willfulness is this silly argument that

323
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,020
the exponential is going to zero, the exponential

324
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:39,410
one. So that is one of the one is one case, one

325
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,930
over one plus one is a half, as you were

326
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:46,160
discussing earlier, in case we actually start

327
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:51,460
approaching infinity that we can't reach. Exactly,

328
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,750
to avoid the diversions, extra constraints on the

329
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,900
difference between energy, well, the energy value

330
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,130
and chemical potential.

331
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,960
So it looks as though the classic element that we

332
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,680
have found by computing the average particle

333
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,610
number in each of these three cases really seems

334
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:16,740
to look like a low temperature rather than this

335
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:23,420
naive high temperature level where we. Ignore the

336
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,920
other. Parameter that defines the great canonical

337
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,810
ensemble. Not only the this year, but also the

338
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:39,120
temperature and chemical potential that. Care can

339
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,500
be adjusted to balance the effect of higher

340
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,390
temperatures, so we can see here that as we take.

341
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,760
Temperature, larger water, the average occupation

342
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,420
numbers of the average number of particles is

343
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,720
increasing of the decreasing denominators, the

344
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:06,410
results that we computed. Which is to say that. As

345
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,290
the temperature gets higher, we start to see a

346
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,800
larger and larger numbers of particles. Which are

347
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,650
increasing the probability that those larger

348
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,250
numbers of particles may end up in the same energy

349
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:21,660
level.

350
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:28,120
And in order to balance that effect, we have the

351
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,350
chemical potential to adjust in tandem with the

352
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,040
temperature to get the true high temperature

353
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:38,780
classical weapons. Where not only does the

354
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,780
temperature go to zero, but the chemical potential,

355
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,690
which we can recall is generally negative from our

356
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:51,080
work in Unit six, needs to be sent to a very large

357
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,500
man if you make it a valid. And whether this has

358
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,310
the effect in this equation. Eighty nine. That as

359
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,120
the denominator in this ratio becomes large in the

360
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,660
high-temperature towards the numerator with a

361
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:11,110
subtraction of this and the potential that is

362
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:14,410
going to negative infinity becomes even larger,

363
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:19,060
even faster, satisfying this inequality even at

364
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:23,570
high temperatures. And what this is doing is.

365
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:30,560
Reducing the probability for seeing large numbers

366
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,010
of particles in the system more negative and gets

367
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:40,370
the greater the energy cost is increasing the

368
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,530
number of particles in the system, going back to

369
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:46,010
the definition of the chemical potential as the.

370
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,560
Responsive to systems, energy or entropy, to a

371
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:53,530
change the protocol number, and then

372
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,500
at the same time that we are reducing the

373
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,890
probability for large numbers of particles by

374
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,400
making the chemical potential negative, by making

375
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,460
the temperature more positive, we increase the

376
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:15,580
number of energy levels that have a measurable

377
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,830
bolson factor.

378
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,250
The exponential of minus energy poverty becomes

379
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,140
the larger probability of single occupancy

380
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,870
as that city going forward here in the heart of

381
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:38,420
the exponential, that becomes less suppressed. So

382
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:42,950
together, these two effects are giving us the true

383
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,790
temperature that. Which has a pair of inequalities

384
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,190
that not only does the temperature have to be

385
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,670
large with respect to the energy levels of

386
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,730
interest, but the negative chemical potential has

387
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,430
to be even larger than that temperature, which to

388
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:05,670
satisfy the liquid derived above, looking to see

389
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,690
where these average occupation numbers become

390
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,490
approximately equal for both classical and quantum

391
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,470
statistics. And

392
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,970
we. Got the three results for that average

393
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:26,950
occupation of anger that we found for classical

394
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:31,260
national statistics in the red dotted line, the

395
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:36,040
blue Quantico's systems and the solid blue van in

396
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,130
the green directions that sticks on the dotted

397
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,720
green line, we see that they do indeed come

398
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,780
together of the edge of this plot in this regime

399
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,690
where what's being plotted only, for example, axis

400
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:58,270
here is exactly that combination of energy by this

401
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:01,680
kind of a potential divided by senator. That we

402
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,950
are giving must be greater than one in the

403
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,580
classical regime. So this is the true

404
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,710
High-temperature what? On the right side of this,

405
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,820
what we can see even that looking at values around

406
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,730
four, which is not strictly much greater than one,

407
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,360
there's already no visible difference between.

408
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:28,270
These three types of statistics. But you do start

409
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:32,480
to break away from each other as we go to. A lower

410
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,100
temperature regimes over on the left side of the.

411
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:39,910
Flot.

412
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,030
Let's put it the limitation there, so we see

413
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,920
looking first at the case of very direct

414
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,640
assistance, a visual confirmation of the

415
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,850
mathematics we did earlier. That the limits of the

416
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,980
occupation number for any given energy level

417
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:04,680
vary only between zero and one consistent with the

418
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,320
exclusion principle that forbids multiple

419
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,000
occupancy. A very, very unusual.

420
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,740
We also see if it goes on this case, the

421
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,880
diversions that was

422
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,940
discussed before the premiere this week and in

423
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,980
response to that question and in between them,

424
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,830
that classical maximalists is this it doesn't

425
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,800
really know anything about the quantum physics

426
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,680
that becomes important about energy, just keeps

427
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:42,280
increasing exponentially quickly as this ratio

428
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,520
that appears in the exponential factor increases.

429
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:55,450
So that's the maximum value and. The divergence

430
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,170
for.

431
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,160
Those are some statistics, but isn't this the

432
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,970
problem, but no. Actually legalized the major.

433
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,370
So that is.

434
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,480
Confirmation of our earlier claim and heuristic

435
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,930
argument that classical important statistics

436
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:25,300
should become equivalent in a classical. Regime or

437
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:31,090
classical with it, we've identified as the

438
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,500
appropriate high temperature limit where the

439
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:37,480
chemical potential is adjusted to control

440
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,500
particles, we're economical and sample. No pause

441
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,160
here at the end of this unit before going go to.

442
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:52,630
Actual applications to quantum systems of gas is

443
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:57,460
to see if there are any questions about. What we

444
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,330
have seen so far.

445
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,530
Yeah, the always.

446
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:14,800
Or.

447
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:24,920
If.

448
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,550
I don't know why that is, that these.

449
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:40,440
Yeah, this is something that we defined by seeing

450
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,850
the structure of the average particle number that

451
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,860
we used in these cases, we went through this

452
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:52,620
computation based on our derivation from Unit six.

453
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,170
This is a good question.

454
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,910
You know, with. The factorization that simplifies

455
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:04,420
life for these nondrinking particles that we're

456
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:08,830
dealing with so far. And we found that each of the

457
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,620
average particle numbers, so the total number of

458
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:16,810
particles in the microstates breaks down or

459
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:20,980
factorization into the sum over all of the energy

460
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:25,780
levels of some expression that depends only on

461
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,750
energy for the energy level and the.

462
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,780
Essentially define the.

463
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,010
Object being slammed over as the average

464
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:45,940
occupation number for that energy level, which we

465
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,200
can motivate as well by seeing the relation in

466
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,470
this case, that when we have an expression for the

467
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,310
total number of particles on average in the entire

468
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:00,280
system. And that breaks up into some over the

469
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,240
energy levels. The thing being sold over is the

470
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,690
average number of particles in the corresponding

471
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,710
energy level and we defined earlier back at the

472
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,860
start of this week, the number of particles in the

473
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:18,850
energy level is defined as the occupation number.

474
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,940
So here you're sort of generalizing that initial

475
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,870
definition to become that average over the

476
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,780
probability space, identifying.

477
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
As average as an occupation number, because it is

478
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,780
precisely the number of particles occupying that

479
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,180
energy level. So if you want, this can be a

480
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:48,690
definition that is inconsistent with both the pure

481
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:52,410
occupation number without averaging over

482
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:56,910
microstates, as well as consistent with the full

483
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:00,800
particle number in the grand approach.

484
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,310
So is that clear enough?

485
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:13,300
How these. The Republicans are going to tell the

486
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:19,210
party of their occupation of the. Averages of both

487
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,250
of those are pretty economical. So.

488
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:33,780
And one possible question that someone has about

489
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,010
might have come up would have been. This more

490
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:41,830
heuristic argument that the quantum regime

491
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:47,420
corresponds to when the weather is a large percent

492
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,820
probability of having multiple occupancy of energy

493
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,720
levels. We've seen in the family directive case

494
00:35:55,110 --> 00:36:00,030
that, of course, multiple can is forbidden and

495
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:05,610
there is a story to tell about how we still obtain

496
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,740
assistance in the direct case was zero probability

497
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,310
of having multiple occupancy and. Onto this

498
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,720
forecast that this is something we will be getting

499
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:23,720
into over the next week or two, looking at quantum

500
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,960
assets, both of those on the fermions, and we get

501
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,070
to the thermionic case, we will see how quantum

502
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:37,960
effects are still important. Even when the

503
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,860
occupation number is restricted to be either zero

504
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:46,240
or one and multiple occupancy is forbidden by the

505
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,670
nature of particles in quantum physics.

506
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,560
That will not be what we do for the remainder of

507
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,850
the day or Monday. We've got about 10 minutes left

508
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,990
to do a.

509
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,420
Bit of a recap connecting what we have now done

510
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,520
with quantum statistics and the grand finale, the

511
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:12,960
ensemble to earlier considerations of. The

512
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,890
classical non relativistic ideal gas, which was

513
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:19,770
the topic of Unit four, that's where we introduced

514
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:27,390
the idea of having an ideal gas confined to some

515
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:34,770
volume of a cubic volume of size that were Kud.

516
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,860
And just to get started, looking at gases of

517
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,550
photons, which are particles of light and the

518
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,980
particular topic, particles of light that I

519
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,560
remember mentioning on Tuesday as an example of

520
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,480
famous bosun's that we have all around us all the

521
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:02,130
time. Let's just do a quick recap of how these.

522
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,990
Massive goes on, so not relativistic particles

523
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:14,320
behave in an ideal gas in the context of the great

524
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:19,820
chemical insult. So I have. Improve the rotation

525
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:24,090
slightly to change the number of energy levels

526
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:30,570
script out, so let's not confuse with the size of

527
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:35,190
the container that these particles are confined to.

528
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:44,910
And we want to. Recall not only the. Economical

529
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,510
patriation function and potential for the

530
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,260
statistics, which I'll skip over, because we just

531
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,490
looked at that at the start of today. We now want

532
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:00,750
to. Compute not only the average particle number,

533
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,010
but also things like the pressure, internal energy

534
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,730
and entropy. Usual large scale macroscopic or

535
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:15,240
thermodynamic quantities that. We saw during this

536
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:20,930
war looking at ecological disaster cycles. And all

537
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,210
that we have to do, starting from this general

538
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:25,310
expression with a.

539
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,930
Placeholder for the energy value corresponding to

540
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:35,190
each energy level is actually specified, the

541
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,840
energy levels for our system would interest. Which

542
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,440
this is where we will see more concretely the

543
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:47,910
issue of degeneracy, where different energy levels

544
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:54,870
or in the end will have the same energy, which is

545
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:58,530
something we have already seen in the novelistic

546
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,470
ideal gas where each particle.

547
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:11,380
With such a mess mass in this volume, allocute has.

548
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:18,670
Quantize energies that depend on the. Some of

549
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:24,350
integers, so this is coming from general, not

550
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,150
relativistic expression that the energy is

551
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,230
momentum squared, divided by twice the mass in

552
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:37,100
these moments of. Our quantized that depend on

553
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:42,230
these integer labels, X, Y, Z, with an overall

554
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:45,830
factor of each bar times higher overall

555
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:50,670
convoluting. Inverse links to units of movements

556
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,340
there by two units of energy.

557
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:01,280
And for convenience, we can supply something we

558
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,970
did in the Gap for and define this, Beaupre factor

559
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,440
is per square. PI squared over two times the mass

560
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,910
of the particles L squared to be a constant unit

561
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:18,840
of energy that is coming in then with. This

562
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,910
combination of factors, the one change that we

563
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:27,130
have to make for quantum particles, is that the

564
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,970
jurors now are no longer merely about negative.

565
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:36,080
They must be strictly positive and.

566
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,790
The reason for this is, again, something coming

567
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:45,390
from on physics at. You don't need to know in

568
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:49,980
advance, and I'll just motivated by here to wrap

569
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,610
up today.

570
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,160
It's a feature of quantum physics known as an

571
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,590
uncertainty principle, which was first discovered

572
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:03,040
by Gregor Heisenberg. He was about twenty five and

573
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:07,120
it relates the precision in quantum mechanics with

574
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,440
which the position and momentum of any particle

575
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,520
can instantaneously be defined in principle. So.

576
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:19,790
It's not an issue of observation or measurements,

577
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:24,470
it's how will define both the position, say, in

578
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:27,010
the X direction and the corresponding momentum,

579
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,730
this piece of X.

580
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:37,110
Are actually in existence in Major so. What

581
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,900
through the forward calculation that involves the

582
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,070
standard deviation includes the precise factors of

583
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:50,860
two high level visit here. And just. The relation

584
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:58,200
between the. The. Uncertainty or precision with

585
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,010
which the position of any particle can be defined,

586
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,160
multiplied by the precision with which its

587
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,040
corresponding momentum can be defined, it must be.

588
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,560
Larger than. This plank's constant for.

589
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,540
Which is relevant when we have placed an ideal gas

590
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,400
in a container before, you know, on a side,

591
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:28,210
because I guarantee you that the position of the

592
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:35,230
particle is known at least as accurately as well

593
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:38,890
as a whole, just because you know what's inside

594
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:42,550
the box. So the position is determined up to the

595
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:47,190
size of that box, which requires that this moment

596
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:51,760
cannot be zero, which would be determined. Exactly.

597
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:58,030
It has to be at least that ratio of over Delta X

598
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,150
or department over help, which not coincidentally,

599
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:06,100
is exactly the P factor of two vectors of Pi that

600
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:11,470
we were working with already for motivation from

601
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,840
the underlying quantum physics taken as an onsides.

602
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:18,370
So.

603
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,000
With this in all of that, we can.

604
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,320
The consideration of these different energy levels

605
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:36,230
and the number of this case and just categorized

606
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:39,230
not only the energy level, but in this case, what

607
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,220
is the what are the generous use of these energy

608
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,970
levels and how the energy levels to behave with

609
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,490
the same energy and the interest of time? I'll

610
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:54,740
just sketch out a few of these. Where? You can

611
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:59,710
start. From the ground state energy level, where

612
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:06,340
the energy use of zero is three times that

613
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,640
elementary unit, we just define each four square

614
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:14,020
square over to him elsewhere. That corresponds to.

615
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,670
This integer vector being one one, one, the

616
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:24,480
minimum possible value of three components. So the

617
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,840
degeneracy here, the number of energy levels with

618
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:33,960
this energy is just this one. If we go up to the

619
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:37,650
next value of energy, so the first excited state.

620
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:42,660
You would have we need to make one of these

621
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:49,770
components of the two rather than one, and then we

622
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:53,730
square that to get the energy. We get four plus

623
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:57,450
one plus one or six times that fundamental unit.

624
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,130
And the degeneracy of the energy levels with this

625
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:08,310
value of the energy is three, depending on which

626
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:11,370
of these components of K we choose to be the

627
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:16,230
larger one equal to two. Similarly, moving on to

628
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:20,700
making any two of those three on the next smallest

629
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,890
number. So. Spectroscope two, two, one, two, one,

630
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:31,430
two, one, two, two. We end up with nine units of

631
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,760
energy and again, I just listed three ways of

632
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,420
getting that.

633
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,520
And even after this and figure out for yourself,

634
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,690
maybe you have just read it down in the interest

635
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:50,190
of time that we have three energy levels with 11

636
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:51,630
units of energy.

637
00:46:53,630 --> 00:47:01,460
Coming from. Making any one component. Of that,

638
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,570
after a three square to nine, then add one plus

639
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,380
one, we make things all to.

640
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:16,990
That's what we get up to 12, Absolon, in the

641
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:25,840
single case, two to two, so that is. Maybe a quick

642
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,170
recap will need to recap on Monday afternoon when

643
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:32,260
we go on to the case of massive snowstorms.

644
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:42,760
We'll pick things up with that novel case of

645
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,940
massless particles in an ideal gas Monday

646
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,280
afternoon and talk more about thermodynamic cycles

647
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:56,590
in the tutorial and see if there are any questions

648
00:47:56,590 --> 00:48:00,520
about the computer project that is due less than a

649
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,910
week from now. And are there any final questions

650
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:09,640
to wrap up this morning's discussion at.

651
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:23,110
If not, I will. Shut things down. Hope to see you

652
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:26,020
again for that this afternoon.
