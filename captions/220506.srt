1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,250
All right, we can get under way this Friday

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,570
morning, after the final homework assignment was

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,240
due, so congratulations for completing all of

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,360
those in-term assignments.  And before I forget I have six

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,700
digits for you this morning:

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,160
Four nine, eight three, nine four.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:37,450
And yes, the remaining milestones to look forward

8
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,080
to are one final week of

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,110
content then a couple of weeks until the final

10
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:52,430
exam on the first of June. So let's do a quick recap

11
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,840
of what we focused on earlier this week to pick things back

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,200
up,

13
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:10,770
so is. Of the today and. Last time we focused on

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,340
the Minnifield approximation to using model in

15
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,240
these dimensions. And in particular, the solutions

16
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:31,340
of self-consistent condition expressed allowable

17
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,570
values of the order parameter, the magnetization.

18
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:43,280
In terms of function of that, the perimeter itself

19
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:44,450
is.

20
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,540
To.

21
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,440
The and then

22
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,250
the the over where does not appear be.

23
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,430
So Peter H.

24
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,160
In particular, you're taking a graphical approach

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,190
to the intersection of those two functions. We saw

26
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,760
that the.

27
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,710
Solution to this were faced with vanishing or a

28
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,910
parameter becomes unstable. And.

29
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,240
Prefers instead a non-zero value of the

30
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,450
mobilization as the temperature.

31
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,830
Decreases, which is sort of related to that

32
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:50,870
expression. And we further were able to predict

33
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,160
things to the bean field approximation, giving us

34
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:00,640
a theory that this change from disorder to to

35
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:06,570
order the. Phases was actually a true second order.

36
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,180
Phase transition.

37
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,690
At the critical temperature, you see this place,

38
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,790
the number of dimensions of the system, and we

39
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:29,620
introduced the concept of. And critical questions

40
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,840
of the way in which.

41
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,510
The order parameter, the magnetization. Varies as

42
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,350
the temperature approaches from below is

43
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,590
proportional to the difference to the one half

44
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,010
hour.

45
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,380
For tea, less than political temperature.

46
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:08,810
And when we wrapped up with a bit of. A bit of a

47
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,140
rush at the end of yesterday was looking at how.

48
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,160
This Manfield approximation, how accurate that

49
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,830
actually is or systems of various dimensions. And

50
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,790
before we revisit that, are there any questions

51
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,380
about the approximation more generally, the way we

52
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,580
derive solutions to it or other aspects of

53
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,800
interacting systems or the biological?

54
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,260
So.

55
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,630
After this. Refer to it a bit more detail about

56
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,840
how well we feel fortunate because we want to turn

57
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,890
from that sort of graphical analysis to something

58
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,250
more mathematical, getting some exact results for

59
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,130
the U.S. model for one dimension, and then in two

60
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,920
dimensions, the two dimensional case will probably

61
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,840
spill over into next Monday. But one dimensions,

62
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,590
we will surely see that there is, in fact, phase

63
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,240
transition at all. This is a model which slightly

64
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,300
contradicts the prediction from the battlefield

65
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,190
approximation of that second of transition at TCT

66
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:39,270
sequels to one equals one. So we will prove an

67
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,370
absence of a phase transition that the complete

68
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,960
failure of your model and we will also see we

69
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,140
won't be able to solve the two dimensional case

70
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,990
and see why, but we will be able to determine.

71
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,340
It's critical temperature that. Can be found

72
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,000
through a trick of this duality and actually

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,160
agrees with the exact solution that all results

74
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,350
are derived. It's a famous work in the 1940s. And

75
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,210
comparing that exact solution to meaningful

76
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,560
approximation, things are a bit better than the

77
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,070
one dimensional case, we now have the exact

78
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,620
solution. And believe your approximation, the

79
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,220
prediction for a second phase transition at some

80
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,980
of the quantitative details are not quite right.

81
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,060
So the critical temperature and the exact case is

82
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,530
just over two. It's up to point to seven point

83
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,290
forty four. And that should be compared with the

84
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,830
ticker for predicting that we could feel more. So

85
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,340
it's all about a factor of two. And the critical

86
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,820
exponents that the legislation is proportional to

87
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,890
comes out to be one based in two dimensions rather

88
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,580
than the one half that we feel. That theory

89
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,640
predicts the approximation, as you call it. So.

90
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,630
There's a correct qualitative prediction of your

91
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,150
second phase transition, but the real details of

92
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,820
that transition are still not captured by the wind

93
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:26,960
field approach, but aside. Mentioned things do

94
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,270
keep getting better and higher and higher

95
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,000
dimensions. The reason for that being that in

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,430
higher dimensions, each site has more nearest

97
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,930
neighbors, so

98
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,560
replacing those by an average would mean over them,

99
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,790
does a better job of capturing the actual behavior

100
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,310
of the system. And the complication now is that

101
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,220
once we get to dimensions, there is no known

102
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,930
analytic solution to the using hole, and such a

103
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,940
solution may not even exist. But both the.

104
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:13,450
Parameter and. Critical experience can be computed

105
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,910
from numerical analysis to establish that there is

106
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,420
indeed a phase transition for all the time the

107
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,300
national theories. And you can use those numerical

108
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,540
calculations to compute the corresponding critical

109
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,020
temperature and critical exposures that we can

110
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,620
compare to the Millfield predictions. So in three

111
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,400
dimensions, which has been studied, a lot of this,

112
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,510
the focus of the magazine article I put up on the

113
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:48,180
site there is. Actually, precise values to several

114
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,910
significant figures for both the critical

115
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,710
temperature and the critical time only put down to

116
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,570
significant figures here just because that's all

117
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,090
we need to compare to the need for oxidation.

118
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,930
We're now about three quarters of the way to the

119
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,210
minefield prediction of three dimensions, critical

120
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,340
temperature of six compared to the true four point

121
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,870
five. And the critical exponent compared to lower

122
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,320
dimensions is steadily creeping up toward the main

123
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,480
field limit. So from. One eighth to a little under

124
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,210
a third president predicts about half. And sort of

125
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,900
similar calculations with less precision have been

126
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,760
carried out in four or five, six and seven

127
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,130
dimensions. Finding. For instance, the critical

128
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,940
temperature is steadily approaching, that too deep

129
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,480
coming from the main fuel approximation. So if we

130
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:59,360
compare. The numerical results, two, eight, 10, 12

131
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,760
and 14 for those for different nationalities that

132
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,270
the use, the model, we see that the discrepancy

133
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,470
drops from about 20 percent to about 10 percent

134
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,650
going up through those higher dimensions than the

135
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,980
formal limit where the dimensionality goes to

136
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,640
infinity. Every state has an infinite number of

137
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,170
nearest neighbors that capture the true

138
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,670
magnetization of the system there in the field.

139
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,380
Approximation actually becomes exact in that

140
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:41,470
abstract limit. So. That was just a few final

141
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,190
comments about the mutual approximation that ran

142
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:51,340
out of time to cover Tuesday. And now we will turn

143
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,930
to justify some of the claims in here for the

144
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,250
other dimension to exact results right now and

145
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,490
then going into some of the ideas behind those

146
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,270
numerical analysis on. In both cases, the showing

147
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,840
of techniques that can be applied to using

148
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,590
violence that are much more generally useful for

149
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,650
more complicated sorts of systems and reactions.

150
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,480
Some of the questions about that wrap up before

151
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,370
moving on to some more formal mathematical

152
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,300
manipulations.

153
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,620
So let's begin this consideration of the one

154
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,200
dimensional exact result just by recalling the

155
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,460
system in question, back up the. Figure from last

156
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,870
week that I used to adjust the focus of the

157
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,400
project this morning and here recalled that with

158
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,940
periodic boundary conditions, the inside is a

159
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,110
model in one dimension simply can be represented

160
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:15,170
as the circle, the wagons and the number of links

161
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,830
between nearest neighbor pairs of sites is

162
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,650
actually the same number as the overall number of

163
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:25,550
sites there are and links for and sites. Because

164
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,910
we can just see by observation or count by seeing

165
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,630
that each site connected to links connects the two

166
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:37,820
sites. So this allows uniquely in one dimension.

167
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,810
This special property is that we can take

168
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:49,240
advantage of the. A limited number of links per

169
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,290
site to rewrite some of our nearest neighbour

170
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:59,480
cares just as Asama over those links. We count

171
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,640
from one up to n take the product of the spin it

172
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,180
side in and the spin cycle plus one that accounts

173
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,750
for every single link that we have in this picture,

174
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,950
which I'll probably put up on the board in just a

175
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,640
few minutes.

176
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:26,140
So. We. Take this some oversights and some of the

177
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,940
links with some of the some of the sites, we can

178
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,210
combine that with the some of the sites that

179
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,340
already appeared in the internal energy for the

180
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,680
U.S. model coupled to that external magnetic field.

181
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,400
For later convenience, we do a trivial

182
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,550
manipulation of adding each side twice and

183
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,840
dividing by two in order to have the two terms and

184
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,510
the internal energy, both involving spin and plus

185
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,050
one. The product coming from your name appears in

186
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,070
the net coupling to the.

187
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:10,040
So inserting this into our petition from the

188
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,330
so-called spin configurations of exponential

189
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,370
growth. Might this be the times, the internal

190
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,310
energy that some so the exponential of the song

191
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:26,680
turns into the product of exponential and the sum

192
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,300
over speed configurations? It is just this long

193
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,380
series of different sounds over the two values,

194
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,090
plus or minus one that each of the hospitals can

195
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:47,910
adopt. So what we want to do is the same. Approach

196
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,550
is not an attractive case, but we were able to

197
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,080
distribute all of those and sums over the spins in

198
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,620
a hyperbolic cosine out of each one that just

199
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,950
recently have power. But now there's a

200
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:11,900
complication coming from the. Term with both sub

201
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:17,670
and an estimated one, namely that on any given

202
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:22,020
spin is going to appear twice in this product over

203
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,330
the site once when excellent response to anyone

204
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,240
else wants to. For example, spend five is going to

205
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,780
appear both equals five and you have to spend five

206
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,230
times to six, but also in equals four. It has been

207
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,310
four times five. And if we were to freely solve

208
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,560
both of those contributions over those values of

209
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:50,280
spin, we would include inconsistent on physical

210
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,650
contributions where the value of the spin was not

211
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,320
being treated so consistently. We're looking at

212
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,380
one of the two nearest neighbor interactions

213
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,870
compared to its other one.

214
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,690
So the. Elliott, way to impose these constraints

215
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:18,290
that the. Spain has the same value. Both times, it

216
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,980
appears, is to recast the.

217
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,650
Exponential factors multiply here as a matrix and

218
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,460
use matrix multiplication to ensure that.

219
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,190
Carry through the information about what speed has,

220
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,830
so first to define this two by two matrix. I'm

221
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,200
going to call it an oversight and where each of

222
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,760
the components corresponds to the four possible

223
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,250
combinations. Of values, the spins that site and

224
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:03,050
then one in these exponential factors. So as an

225
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:09,390
example, if both S7 plus one are one, we pick up E

226
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,460
to the positive Baida and one plus one of the two

227
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:20,900
is to be the H in the next one for the final term

228
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,600
as the sun cancels its drops out of the products

229
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,310
minus one.

230
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:32,470
And if we consider taking the product of two of

231
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,430
these matrices.

232
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:41,250
You will see that in that Matrix product. The. The

233
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,660
road here, for instance, is going to be contracted

234
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,710
with the first column, so the value is where?

235
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,170
Spirit then has minus one or both going to be

236
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,520
contracted.

237
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,400
I should have focused on the diagonal pieces,

238
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,150
really, so contracting both of these spin minus

239
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:11,900
ones with the second column of the next matrix in

240
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,890
the row incorrectly pick up the value of the spin

241
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,840
minus one in a consistent way. So hopefully, if

242
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,670
this is not intuitively obvious and something, you

243
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,730
can convince yourself that possibly by writing

244
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,590
down some further examples, but going over the

245
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:37,160
product of all these two by two matrices, we will

246
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,960
end up contracting all of the internal indices

247
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,630
that correspond to the repeated values of the

248
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,700
spin's will be left only with the spin one and

249
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,880
spin capital and plus one either side of that

250
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,050
product and periodic common conditions then

251
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:03,770
identify those. So we call that. Economic

252
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:08,670
conditions imposed plus one is exactly the same as

253
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:14,620
a one, so. Closing that loop and ensuring that.

254
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,050
The value of this single spin wrapping around the

255
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,110
periodic boundary is also self-consistent, just

256
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:28,280
gives us the overall cyclic trace. Of that product

257
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,950
of all matrices. My question

258
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,960
is, why was. And. The choice is what better

259
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,270
conditions to perform order? Of the Trece.

260
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,080
So what that trace is doing, if we write that out,

261
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,690
we can drop the index and because as we can see,

262
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,300
all of these matrices are actually independent of

263
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,460
them, just call the T.. So this trace is giving us

264
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,650
benefactors of this matrix so as to buy that I

265
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,590
enjoy are those two values of the spin system one

266
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,290
and two. That is correct. That's been true. It's

267
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:18,690
been three. We have some consistent values of

268
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,040
students. That's why the state index appears to be

269
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:31,880
sold over shake and so on. Similarly, T.J., L. all

270
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,490
the way to this tea and call it capital and then.

271
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,020
What would be enforced when that is identified

272
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,950
with speed by the very first Conex? So we have the

273
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,150
in the final index on this product of matrices is

274
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:56,380
the same as the first one and also has to be some

275
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:02,830
over. In that song, to produce or to impose this

276
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,770
constraint that the same value of the state

277
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,780
appears in.

278
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,750
Both terms in both the actions that was involved

279
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,310
and we can recognize that I already put the sign

280
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,580
there, but this Matrix product with all of the

281
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,760
indices cyclically contracted is indeed the

282
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,180
definition of the phrase. Which is also useful

283
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,410
because it gives us just the single number that

284
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,560
the petition function is rather than a two by two

285
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,740
matrix. So this is the simplest case we can also

286
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,280
consider.

287
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,220
More complicated situations where periodic

288
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,780
boundary conditions are not imposed and some of

289
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,270
the standards will have different numbers in your

290
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,300
state attraction to that case, you would still get

291
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,460
a trace of all of the spins in the middle of that

292
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,390
chain with different factors appearing to accept

293
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,060
the absence of periodic boundary conditions. But

294
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,360
it is the. I guess the trace, in essence, is that

295
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,150
reflection of how the periodic boundary conditions

296
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:18,850
simplify the set up, as we saw before, by ensuring

297
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,380
that all of the sites have the same number of

298
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,870
links.

299
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:29,830
So. I'll leave that there for now. I keep thinking

300
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:34,110
about all of this remains unclear. We can move

301
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:40,820
forward to, actually. Try to solve our partisan

302
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,060
function, which is now written in a more compact

303
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:49,470
way, and we originally had it's just the trees and

304
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:54,260
powers of this two by two matrix that are in the

305
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,130
business is known as the transfer matrix, the idea

306
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:02,600
being that it's transferring information about the

307
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,550
value of a given spin from one week to the next so

308
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:13,420
that the links are treating. That's been in a

309
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,540
self-consistent way.

310
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,090
And if we want to.

311
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,280
Figure out the trace of a large number of

312
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,190
identical products in The Matrix. The simple way

313
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,980
to do that is to diagnose the Matrix and then all

314
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,960
of these powers simply.

315
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,350
Carry through into powers of the eigenvalues that

316
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,320
appear on the diagonal, so multiplying diagonal

317
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,530
matrices, it's easy in that sense and then taking

318
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:54,420
the trace itself is also easy is just the sum of

319
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,870
those powers of in this case for two by three

320
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:03,270
matrices, these two. Different eigenvalues, I've

321
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,180
called them the plus and minus.

322
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:16,890
Yes, this may well be the. First time of matrices

323
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,180
and relations are appearing in this particular

324
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:28,690
module, so I can. Check in and remind you or ask,

325
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,370
what is the strategy to stabilize the matrix of

326
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,820
this or how do we find these eigenvalues lamda

327
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,080
plus or minus?

328
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,410
See?

329
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,390
Rather than.

330
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,350
Putting that on your list gives you the reminder

331
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,330
this is the. So the first appearance that the

332
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,170
eigenvalues are coming from the roots of the

333
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,110
characteristic polynomial. So we take the

334
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:14,930
determinants of this matrix to the transfer matrix,

335
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:20,720
subtract. Lamda minus the identity and the look at

336
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,260
the detriment of vets that are represented by the.

337
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,440
Square eliminators on either side of that matrix,

338
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,840
so. Subtracting that language just modifies the

339
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,410
diagonal components of this matrix, using the data

340
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,220
in the data minus lambda.

341
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,630
Either the White House made the afternoon holds

342
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,420
the key to the beat of the White House page, again

343
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,830
minus Linda, if we take the determination that

344
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:59,060
it's just the product of the was minus the product

345
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,690
at the time to two cities are simple in that way.

346
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,670
So we can pull out that positive factor of Lambda

347
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,770
Square. It will be two negative factors,

348
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,460
Portugal's lamda, both of which have either

349
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,000
positive baylon, one of which has either debated

350
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,140
each other as to why this day and age.

351
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,710
Plus, sign about the overall negative sign there.

352
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,830
And then finally, the product of those commercials.

353
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:40,850
Gives us the use of the two Beira plus or minus

354
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,680
chancel and subtracting the product off nine one

355
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,610
is each of the minus two data, which we can.

356
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,940
Recognize as corresponding to some of those nice

357
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:59,540
hyperbolic trigonometric functions, we have the.

358
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:10,120
Lambda Square. Minus Lamda times to Coche. That is

359
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:15,160
the way to cool. For the rival, so will either the

360
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,840
X plus, even minus X, the cosine and similarly the

361
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:24,580
two terms in the X minus equal minus six are twice

362
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:29,470
the hyperbolic sign now of two data rather than a

363
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,320
H. And we want to find the lambda, which is

364
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,810
characteristic polynomial is equal to zero which.

365
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,030
We can get just from the.

366
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,950
Quadratic equation varlet, why I was calling the

367
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,940
eigenvalue Linda plus and minus is there will be a

368
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,490
plus or minus appearing in the solutions here that

369
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,150
we. That factor over to a survey was commissioned

370
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,260
by the Square. That's one A minus B is the

371
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,270
negative of the coefficient of 11 to. Used to be

372
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:17,260
the hyperbolic cosine each. And then plus or minus

373
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,820
the square root of the discriminant B squared, or

374
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:29,660
he'd be to bad A. Cos squared in H and then minus

375
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,350
four, a C factor of eight.

376
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,940
Some of you better

377
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,270
and we can check easily enough that this

378
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:49,140
expression. First of all, we can cancel out the

379
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,750
fact that you to all the way through with it seems

380
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,410
to a slightly simpler.

381
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,360
Because we're interested in systems with. Now,

382
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,650
negative temperatures and zero positive, as well

383
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:11,260
as negative externalities like fields, how we

384
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:11,950
define the.

385
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,690
Those parameters that appear in here for those

386
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:21,950
regimes, both of these eigenvalues possibilities

387
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,510
are real. So that you factor in the square root is

388
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:32,600
positive. And it's easy enough to see that the

389
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,000
solution that the plus side is always going to be

390
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,790
larger than that with the negative side. Thanks to

391
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,960
the reality of that security factor, we can check

392
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,040
that has been close to zero, this expression, so

393
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,100
the temperature is going to be a very high

394
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,710
temperature limit there by cosigns. Go to one. Has

395
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:02,230
to be exponential factors. And we end up with the

396
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,920
factor of one from the first term and the

397
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,850
sensuousness hero square root of one from the

398
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,970
second term, which is one plus or minus one.

399
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,570
Independent of that external fuel and especially

400
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:22,740
case zero field easing automotive, we turn off the

401
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:27,320
external fuel set to zero. That also puts those

402
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:33,950
hydraulics lines to one. And. We ended up just

403
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,370
with.

404
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,210
Because in that. It's somewhere.

405
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:47,940
So I think the margin will be zero. And the plus

406
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:56,530
minus is just. That's E Tanabata. From seven to

407
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:03,100
one with zero plus or minus the square root. Two

408
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,950
data from the cost minus the essential to the data,

409
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:13,850
which is needed to be the. Minus the. Minus two

410
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,670
beta taking account of that factor of two in their.

411
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,090
Those two factors cancel out the positive, the

412
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,890
minus two beta squared. That gives us either the

413
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:32,460
beta plus or minus the minus beta as advertised.

414
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:40,850
Is twice the sign, the sign satisfying? The

415
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,830
overall. Expected behavior that the task is always

416
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:54,130
truly greater than divide us, and if if we we can

417
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,310
numerically plot all of this for the case of both

418
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:02,350
non-zero speed and age, the typically this.

419
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,190
There's a very large exponential hierarchy between

420
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,550
those two eigenvalues, but in any case, because

421
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,450
LAMDA plus is the larger eigenvalue, we can

422
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,290
rewrite our partition function

423
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,120
before we have to trust the power in this name

424
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,900
minus the power. And if we pull out of a factor of

425
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,710
LAMDA plus to the end times one plus that ratio of

426
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:35,630
the two eigenvalues as then becomes sufficiently

427
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,230
large.

428
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,130
Something less than one race to a large power.

429
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,460
It's going to be driven down to zero, leaving us

430
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,920
just with. And even simpler expressions for the

431
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:52,840
action function is the largest eigenvalue to the

432
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,420
power of the number of spins in our one

433
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:59,200
dimensional system. It can be right here pulling

434
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,250
out the overall factor of the hyperbolic cosine of.

435
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,240
Just to further emphasize how this is always. A

436
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,370
real positive result. So there it is, we've solved

437
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:16,730
the one dimensional using model. That's what the

438
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:21,050
solution looks like and it's not really.

439
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:27,840
Revelatory to sit and stare at all these

440
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:31,950
exponential factors, what we can do to extract

441
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:36,360
information from the solution is to use this to

442
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,710
predict some observables and in particular, we're

443
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:46,330
interested in the order parameter for the. Ordered

444
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:49,000
in disorder phases that we've been considering

445
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,700
this week as the metaphysician that we have

446
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:57,760
related to a derivative of the free energy. With

447
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,320
respect to the external magnetic field and maybe

448
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,080
worth mentioning, we're emphasizing in this

449
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,840
calculation that the order of limits.

450
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,220
Those that will take an interview tomorrow and

451
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,620
we're going to consider the zero field.

452
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:22,050
Is what the countries where we obtain solutions

453
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,340
from the population on Tuesday and.

454
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,930
Considering that Israel will limit, we have to set

455
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,800
the field to zero only after. Taking this

456
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,860
derivative of the free energy and getting the

457
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,100
result for people to parameter by doing that, we

458
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,960
don't have to worry about the absolute value that

459
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,400
we. Introduced, we were doing things more

460
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,890
heuristically last week.

461
00:34:54,890 --> 00:35:01,170
And what we find so. We. Like in.

462
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,260
The.

463
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,480
Expression here that the petition functions said

464
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:14,950
is land of lost to power and then.

465
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,340
There is some simplification that.

466
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,110
Occurs to the derivative, so first of all, the

467
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,870
more that that power can bring down a factor in

468
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:33,670
the case that the one in the denominator and the

469
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,050
derivative of the logarithm is one over argue into

470
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,410
the law of the law. So.

471
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,910
Instead, at the end, pick up that one over there,

472
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:51,380
plus you still have to bailout the derivative of

473
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:55,320
us with respect to that magnetic field and then

474
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,460
evaluated that it will set off the magnetic field.

475
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:06,100
So what is that derivative of eigenvalue, the

476
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:10,910
transfer matrix with respect to the field? But at

477
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,950
it from. I work above

478
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,340
the times, I'd like to assign each the positive

479
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:29,380
side. And the square root. On to the costs would

480
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:33,020
have been a. Miles, to synch

481
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,740
to to better.

482
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:46,110
So each of these terms is going to. The main after

483
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:51,290
taking the H. On the eve of the bailout, we'll

484
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,530
just pass through the derivative of the cost is

485
00:36:54,530 --> 00:37:00,080
going to give us hyperbolic some of bit H and when

486
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,350
we take the derivative of the square root of this

487
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:06,110
discriminators the quadratic equation, something

488
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,550
interesting happens, people.

489
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,560
So the argument for the square root will go to the

490
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:20,580
denominator. We have one over that square root of

491
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:27,030
the square and then the. Chain rule takes the

492
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,460
derivative of that argument.

493
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,930
Into the numerator, and if we call that, we can

494
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:42,280
pull out net overall growth sector. We can see

495
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,690
that in the second term, there will be an overall

496
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:53,210
factor of. Two times the coshed times the senge,

497
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,170
so overall up to some complicated, no matter what

498
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:02,280
the square root equations, both terms here and the

499
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,270
proportional to the hyperbolic senge, and when we

500
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,930
set that set H to zero, the argument of that

501
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,870
hyperbolic sentence goes to zero and we find

502
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:20,480
overall. That would setting it to zero in the

503
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,970
expression for the immigration.

504
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:28,760
We have zero magnetization with the zero

505
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:35,360
independent of the temperature, so. This is

506
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:41,600
something this application coming from the zero

507
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,430
field case. And what's more, it is the.

508
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:54,100
The proof of the claim that we discussed at the

509
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,440
end of our consideration that we feel

510
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,500
approximation. Zero field using one dimension has

511
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,950
no pasteurisation at all. The position is always

512
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,640
zero responding personality disorder phase, even

513
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,650
as the temperature goes to be vanishingly small

514
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:19,490
value. So. That is, of course, revealing the

515
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,980
administrations of the need for an approximation

516
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,320
before the election where there are a minimal

517
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,470
number of nearest neighbor interactions for the

518
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:34,010
system. We can also recall that last week we tried

519
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:39,320
to treat the independence of the dimensionality

520
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,770
and claim that there were always these two

521
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,920
different places at high temperatures and this one.

522
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,610
And that argument that we went through with

523
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:54,130
General mention is. Again, it is also being

524
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,510
contradicted by this exact result in the

525
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:02,680
individual case, so it's worth Rabinow. This.

526
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:07,770
Consideration of the individual case by thinking

527
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:12,870
about what went wrong in our discussions last week,

528
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,960
a bit more heuristic in terms of.

529
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,040
The two faces of these high temperatures will be

530
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,500
argued that high temperatures, all of the

531
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,720
microstates Appu with roughly equal probability.

532
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,650
And therefore, to the distribution of spin's with

533
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:39,070
the largest multiplicity wins. So that's the

534
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,820
factorial enhancements of the disorder stage with

535
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,980
roughly equal distance. And in contrast, we have

536
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,400
argued that more temperatures there is an

537
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,480
exponential preference for border states close to

538
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,500
the ground states where. We claim that the first

539
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,650
extended interview level was exponentially

540
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,330
suppressed and corresponded to the value of the

541
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,810
mobilization that was close to the maximum value

542
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:15,000
on. We treated that first extended energy level as

543
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:18,900
what we would have upon flipping a single skin.

544
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,280
Against the line, the others have taken this from

545
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,430
the ground, say the line to this first excited

546
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:32,040
state and there were no objections when we went

547
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,000
through that class is true for two dimensions at

548
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,280
higher. But there are uniquely in one dimension.

549
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:43,920
Difference.

550
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:49,870
States that also have the same energy as you can

551
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:55,060
get the biggest single step, and this is where it

552
00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:01,120
might be worthwhile to draw that. So. Motivational

553
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:05,900
system on the board, if I suppose that you can

554
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:13,360
have. The same number of spins, more circular

555
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:17,980
pattern, feeling the links between them, one of

556
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,150
the ground states is where all the moral and the

557
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:26,530
negative about this line is to denote the minus

558
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,470
one down for the spin and consider flipping one of

559
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:36,460
those two plus spin plus one. This was one of the

560
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:42,350
microstates that. Has the maximum next of energy

561
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:47,640
for One Direction's. Instead of a minus and all

562
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:52,590
this in line to take out a positive contribution

563
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:57,680
to the energy of a plus two from each of you to

564
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,250
separate your actions of that spirit, that is an

565
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:07,230
energy, a minus and plus for. And there are days

566
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,510
where any one of these things can be said. So that

567
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:12,360
is what we went through before. And what happens

568
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,870
in one dimension or in one dimension, but not in

569
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:21,930
higher dimensions, is if we were to slip another

570
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:25,530
step and say this one up here, you would have a

571
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,800
higher energy positive contributions for those two

572
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,580
things, which is those two things. But if we were

573
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:37,020
to foot one of the two things, number one, we

574
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,560
already flipped. We now get back to a negative

575
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,650
contribution for the interaction between those two.

576
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,560
They are alive. And we still only have two

577
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,500
positive contributions now from these two. And

578
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:54,440
there's not clear for me to distinguish things in

579
00:43:54,450 --> 00:44:01,400
here from these two links that surround the. Set

580
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,070
of neighboring spins that are aligned in the

581
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:07,820
opposite direction. So this is another microstates

582
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,650
that contributes to that first excitement and

583
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:16,090
again. Imagine rotating all these around the

584
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:19,090
circles near the other end possibilities,

585
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:25,480
and the same thing happens if we took the next

586
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,890
step again only

587
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,390
to positive contributions at the energy level as

588
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:39,700
more and more of the overall mobilization is

589
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:45,550
decreasing further and further away from. The

590
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:50,370
value of one, and in the case that I have out here,

591
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,030
we have flipped enough spins to have a vanishing

592
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:58,540
position with the same energy, that first energy

593
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:04,310
level. So it is not the case that all of the

594
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:08,480
microstates in this first extended interview will

595
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:12,800
have evangelisation close to one of the largest

596
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,190
Nimetz.

597
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,130
That is unique to one dimension where the rough

598
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:24,850
argument from last week was too, too quick to be

599
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:29,680
correct in that we have an exact solution. We can

600
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,520
see that accounting for all of these other

601
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,230
microstates with different elements of the

602
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:38,660
taxation that contributes to that first excitement,

603
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,030
excitement, energy level.

604
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:43,840
Ends up.

605
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,240
Removing the possibility of an order phase and a

606
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,510
transition in this one dimensional case. And.

607
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:04,360
It is useful in this exercise to. Draw and sort of

608
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,800
what I have here with these.

609
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:13,000
Double lines separating these domains of skills

610
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,890
that are on the line in one particular direction.

611
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:22,460
So this sort of analysis is often presented in

612
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:29,300
terms of walls, barriers between those two domains

613
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:33,890
where for the students boycott all the students

614
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:40,100
put down. And because if either of these domain

615
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:45,140
walls move around the system, they don't introduce

616
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:50,360
any energy costs. They. Shift the positive

617
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,820
contribution from one week to the next without

618
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,840
change the total number, we can analyze the system

619
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,590
as well as they can create a group so that we as a

620
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:04,890
country to grow without any energy costs. Covering

621
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:10,420
all values of the magnetization. With at least one

622
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:11,290
spin.

623
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:16,440
Not aligned with all the others, so covering that

624
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:20,130
nearly full range that approaches the full range

625
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:26,640
of atomisation as in increases so.

626
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:34,830
That's where our earlier discussion went wrong

627
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:38,330
with the one dimensional case and we will pick up

628
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:41,390
on Monday with the calculation of the two

629
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:43,510
dimensional critical temperature

630
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:51,480
there's. Not much point in starting that just in

631
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:57,600
the remaining minute shipping, this stopping point

632
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,580
at the end of the exact one dimensional solution I

633
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,960
just mentioned historically, this is this exact

634
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,080
solution and one dimensions is but using found is

635
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:11,550
the work that led him to conclude that the easy

636
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,740
model could not actually describe phase

637
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:18,690
transitions. Of course, at that point. So the

638
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,300
demonstration. That these conditions are indeed

639
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:27,550
possible, higher dimensions is a necessary step to

640
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:31,930
using models adoption and brought use to talk

641
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,900
about all sorts of things that the motivation.

642
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,920
When coming back from the spring break last week,

643
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,840
so we'll pick up with. What do you do about Monday?

644
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:46,050
Are there any questions about the one that is

645
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:50,160
involved before we shut down for this morning?

646
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,300
Not seeing any I will see you back in the

647
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:03,360
afternoon to over the. Variations of the model and

648
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,790
different set of structures and possibly other

649
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,970
fun things as time permits accuracy, then.
