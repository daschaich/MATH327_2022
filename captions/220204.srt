1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,670
In terms of recordings, it's interesting, what I've

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,670
seen is that Zoom recordings are better quality

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,160
than the university's Stream Capture system and they're

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,340
also about four times smaller files, which shows

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,160
what you can do with lots of programmers working

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,910
for you. To start with some of the boring stuff while

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,220
we wake up

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:33,950
the magic number for attendance checking

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,920
is one oh

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:47,240
three oh eight four and let me know if that's too small

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,230
to actually see.

12
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,760
And as we get going, are there any media questions

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,990
left in your mind from earlier in the week?

14
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:10,470
So quickly recap what came up at that time, so.

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,520
Maybe before recapping a couple of logistical

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,140
notes that the first part of the computer project

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,840
assignments, it is now up on canvas.

18
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,430
Available for you to work on. And this afternoon,

19
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,220
we'll look through some of

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,520
the Python programming background that will be

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,940
useful for that, those who may or may not have

22
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,810
done any programming before. And there was also on

23
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,890
that poll I had run during this week, just a

24
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,120
couple of requests for a to print paper copies of

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,180
the notes. For those of you who prefer paper, the

26
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,500
end might not have easy access to a printer. So

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,010
rather than trying to juggle that. Here live in

28
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,920
your. I just left them in the box. Outside my

29
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,780
office, which is one twenty three, the theoretical

30
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,050
physics wing, so those of you who requested those

31
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,080
printouts can just come by and pick them up

32
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,150
whenever it's convenient for you. They're just

33
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,860
sitting in the hall for you and getting into. The.

34
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,100
Actual physics and mathematics we looked at

35
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,390
earlier this week to be two main points, to recap

36
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:52,330
very quickly that the essence of statistical

37
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,430
physics is bringing probabilistic processes,

38
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,780
holistic methods.

39
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,860
To tackle the practical problem. Of handling

40
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,700
systems with many degrees of freedom, many the

41
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,410
objects in these systems.

42
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:23,390
Where many is something of order tend to be. Tower

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,890
twenty three or more. And then we went through a

44
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,590
sequence of formal definitions for these

45
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,600
probabilistic foundations.

46
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,710
We are going to be developing and applying, in

47
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:51,670
particular defining. Outcomes. Of experiments to

48
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:59,030
be. Roughly equivalent to the states, I should say,

49
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,480
the outcomes of measurements can be treated

50
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,880
equitably with the states that results from doing

51
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,110
experiments in precise ways that we define and

52
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:14,270
then subsets or sets of outcomes.

53
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,150
Give events to which we can assign probabilities.

54
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,000
And based on that, we got to the. Concept of the

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,440
law of large numbers

56
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,160
can have to be careful to keep the paper actually

57
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,090
on the screen up there where we have the idea of

58
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,530
defining an experiment and repeating it some

59
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,860
number of times from which we can monitor the

60
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,070
outcome is used to define things like the

61
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,870
arithmetic mean is the average value of the

62
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,770
outcome of interest as the experiment is repeated

63
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,710
other times, which has some connection to the true

64
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,170
meaning that is defined for probability

65
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:19,150
distribution itself. So another call for questions

66
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,660
about any of those topics before moving forward

67
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,560
with this idea to establish this connection

68
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,860
between arithmetic means and the true means of the

69
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,640
distribution.

70
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,460
Where? The key thing to consider is what's.

71
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,140
Pulled up in this box, which may turn out to be a

72
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,150
little small for me to do the deliberations. So

73
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,220
what we're looking at here is essentially how this

74
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,310
arithmetic mean fluctuates around the true meaning

75
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,350
you within the expectation value that is

76
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,550
considering this object as a random variable for

77
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,220
all of the outcomes in the outcome set in space.

78
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,760
Of the experiments and the measurement that we

79
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,870
have in mind to define the outcomes themselves.

80
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,600
And.

81
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:34,680
What we can do to. Tackle, this is a little trick

82
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,660
to bear, which is.

83
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,570
Slide margin over here just to.

84
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:53,450
Simplify things. We note that if we rate. The

85
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,620
summer over, these are repetitions of the

86
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,240
experiments of view that use a constant within the

87
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,830
expectation values. This is just our times new.

88
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:14,100
So if we bring out the overall one of our squared.

89
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,300
The cost factor being squared. Within that

90
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,650
expectation, value can be pulled outside. And then

91
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,910
you're left with that sum over all those hours. Of

92
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,520
that. Exaro minus mu, or if we pull out that one

93
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,980
over, we get our view that we can turn into

94
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,920
another factor of that. So we have parentheses

95
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:49,540
within parentheses. So we are now sending over the

96
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,670
fluctuations for each repetition around the mean.

97
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,240
And that some as a whole gets squared. And then we

98
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,480
take the expectation value of that whole kind of

99
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,570
complicated object that we can now expand and

100
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:12,720
simplify it. And by extension, I mean. That. I

101
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,400
would just right the square of the sun as the

102
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:23,640
product of two repetitions. Of the song with.

103
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,890
Difference, independents. Variables, counting the

104
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,410
outcomes of your going over. So that is just what

105
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,890
it means to square Aselton two factors of that

106
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,750
sound multiplied together and see why we have

107
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:48,970
introduced a few lines up the page, this little

108
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,770
relation, which

109
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,590
is.

110
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:56,720
A.

111
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,690
Something that we will take is given just saying

112
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,720
that if we multiply together two sets of

113
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,130
independent fluctuations around the mean value, we

114
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,980
can expect that when the indices on those

115
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,920
fluctuations are the same or we just have a single

116
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,410
set of fluctuations that squared those

117
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,440
fluctuations squared, give us the variance of the

118
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,460
distribution from the expectation value. But if

119
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,380
those two sets of fluctuations are different, then

120
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,180
upon something over all of the outcomes of the

121
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,850
definition of expectation value, we're going to

122
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,900
get lots of noise fluctuating around. These means

123
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,950
that on average, the expectation value is going to

124
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,390
cancel out an advantage so we could get zero. In

125
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,280
that case, when this I and J are different and

126
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,360
that can be wrapped up in this product, Delta and

127
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,800
Delta IJA, which is just one one equals zero. And

128
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,960
on different. It's something that I expect you've

129
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,390
seen before in other models

130
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:14,410
and I have. Written things here in.

131
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,740
Such a way that this can be immediately applied.

132
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,560
One more step in between, which is just noting

133
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,200
that the product of two songs is equal to the

134
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,350
combined sum of all of the Independent.

135
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:42,980
Combinations of the two seats up or something easy

136
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,000
to see in case of multiplying two by four together

137
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,390
and then generalize to arbitrary sums by adduction.

138
00:10:53,500 --> 00:11:00,050
And that lets us right. This product has sold over

139
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,720
an hour, and that's. Of.

140
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,270
The corresponding factors.

141
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,310
So we then have the product of the two

142
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:18,080
fluctuations within the expectation value, which.

143
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,200
Gives us.

144
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,280
The expression written in terms of the variance

145
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,310
sigma squared and.

146
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,900
And. The.

147
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,830
Honaker, Delta, Delta R. S insists that Delta R. S

148
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,720
is zero whenever R is different from S and one

149
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,730
equals s.

150
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,680
We can rewrite that some of our this as just the

151
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:58,810
sum over. The set where our equals dolto are,

152
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,860
which is one if you some have won our times, is a

153
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,910
factor of our enumerator canceling out one of the

154
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:14,120
two factors of our and the denominator and that

155
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,260
stayed on the screen reasonably well. So what does

156
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,350
this mean? That the fluctuations of the arithmetic

157
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:31,260
mean around the Trumaine are the variance, which

158
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,720
is a constant property of the probability

159
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,630
distribution divided by the number of repetitions.

160
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,800
So as long as that variance is finite. In the

161
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,540
limit of an infinite number of repetitions, this.

162
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,520
Complicated expectation value is going to zero as

163
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,920
our. Goes to infinity.

164
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,290
And from this. Because we chose with some

165
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,070
forethought to square the fluctuations in the

166
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,930
expectation value that we consider, we know that

167
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,760
the definition of the expectation value is the sum

168
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:21,010
of all the terms being considered weighted by

169
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,870
their probabilities in the distribution. With the

170
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,570
square, all of those terms are now negative, so

171
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,260
there are no cancellations. So if that sum of non

172
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,170
negative terms equals zero, that can only happen

173
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:39,700
if each individual term in the sum is itself zero,

174
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,270
which is the statement of the law that as we take

175
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,290
the limit of all of them to infinity, everything

176
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,160
in those parentheses which fell off the screen.

177
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,010
That's the argument of those parentheses at zero,

178
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,290
which I can rearrange just to say that the

179
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,550
arithmetic mean is equal to the true meaning with

180
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,490
a sufficient number of repetitions. Again,

181
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,270
assuming that the variance is finite of the meat

182
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,060
itself exists to be defined.

183
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:25,070
And now. So part of the programming exercise is to

184
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,510
verify this numerically and also see the approach

185
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,010
of the arithmetic mean to the truth. And that is

186
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:42,610
hopefully. A clear arguments going through the.

187
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,710
Mathematical calculation about whether questions

188
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:54,590
about the individual steps or the meaning of what

189
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,560
we have produced here in this comment box.

190
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,320
And not seeing any said the law of large numbers

191
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,730
aside arithmetically, is approaching true based

192
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,850
upon repetition of experiments and just do a quick

193
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:24,550
generalisation of the probability spaces that

194
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,860
we've been considering. You said before. That's

195
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,360
what we're talking about. Generally, we talk about

196
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,450
discrete sets of outcomes for simplicity. We roll

197
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,880
the dice, see what number comes out on top. There

198
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,090
are six possibilities. The entire framework

199
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:44,140
generalizes to the case of uncharitably infinite

200
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,370
conspiracies, things like picking any number on

201
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:55,440
the line of real numbers. The one where. The

202
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,940
number of possible outcomes is continuous, and if

203
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,650
there are uncountable infinite number of possible

204
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,550
outcomes, and in order to relate those outcomes

205
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,240
and the corresponding sets of the matter events to

206
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,070
probabilities, we have to be a bit more clever

207
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,830
than just taking the individual outcomes,

208
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,470
enumerating them and assigning the probabilities

209
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,410
without accountability. We have to consider

210
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:31,860
instead the distribution of probabilities as a

211
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,060
function of the continuous variables that we have.

212
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,690
In this case, just considering a single real

213
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,640
variable for simplicity generalizes to any finite

214
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,320
number of variables. You get this multidimensional

215
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,610
integrals square. The way that we connect these

216
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,900
probability distributions to actual probabilities

217
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,820
is by associating the probability with some

218
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,310
non-zero interval around the region of interest.

219
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:14,670
In. In that variable cheer, X is a real number,

220
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,990
and that probability is computed as the integral

221
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:27,720
of the distribution over that interval. And so

222
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,440
there's this just completely analogous

223
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:35,150
generalisation of the expectation value back in

224
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,810
the case of. Finite items that we remember that

225
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:46,370
the expectation value was given by the sum of all

226
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:54,970
X in that space of F of X, that means if F times

227
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,410
the probability of X here is that that probability

228
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,050
we have. The integral over the probability

229
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:08,450
distribution where whenever I ovid's to the upper

230
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,450
and lower limits from the political on, just

231
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,470
assume it's over the full range of possible values

232
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:21,220
for. For that independent variable X in this case

233
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:29,170
here, the entire domain and as an example, the one

234
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,170
of the requirements on probabilities is that when

235
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:37,570
going over all X started to go off the screen of

236
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,260
it, they're going over all X, and that outcome

237
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,650
sets the probability itself has to add up to one

238
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,440
hundred percent, which now becomes an integral

239
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,350
equation. The integral of the probability

240
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:57,290
distribution over the full domain is one. So if we

241
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:04,190
specify specialized to particular functions, F of

242
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,540
X being powers of X, then it's straightforward to

243
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,040
get back the mean of the distribution, the

244
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,520
expectation value of X, just the integral of X

245
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:21,860
times X. And then the variance, as we do here, is

246
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,960
still the difference between the expectation value

247
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,030
of X squared minus the square of the mean

248
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,070
expectation value of X new square.

249
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,340
Within X Square is that same integral over the

250
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,780
probabilities weighted by X squared.

251
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,160
And that's the briefing aside on that

252
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,920
generalization, which becomes relevant when. And

253
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,220
start looking at the central limit theorem. So

254
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,850
assuming that everything about this is clear, feel

255
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,490
free to shout out if it is not,

256
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:14,750
you can apply it to that central limit theorem,

257
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:20,000
which is is so called because it is central to

258
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,670
probability, not because there are two things.

259
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,860
Anything to do with centers of distribution,

260
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,990
anything like that is to say limit theorem that is

261
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:33,020
of central importance and it shows up in many

262
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,340
different forms for many different situations.

263
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,990
What we'll do is just define a particular formula

264
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,770
central with your statement that is going to be of

265
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,330
interest to us, which.

266
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:52,340
Starts by considering this random variable X for

267
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,920
the sum of all of the.

268
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,280
In some number of independent random variables, so

269
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,100
this is. Inspired by what we were talking about,

270
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,480
the last large numbers, repeating some experiments,

271
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,230
some number of times, each of those repetitions

272
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:20,650
can define a outcome X, which is an independent

273
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,220
random variable with the same meaning and variance

274
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:29,230
that, again, we assume are finite. So a number of

275
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,450
identical random variables that we sum in order to

276
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:40,360
define this as a result. So the S itself is also a

277
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,730
random variable associated to the end repetitions

278
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:51,090
of the underlying process. The experiment just the

279
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,850
way. We talked about earlier and then we just

280
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:01,100
state that the. The probability distribution for

281
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,020
this test we can treat as a continuous parameter

282
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,410
and the limits of a large number of repetitions is

283
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,140
given by a Gaussian distribution,

284
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:19,160
which is to say it is exponentially weighted

285
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:25,790
around and times the meaning of each individual

286
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:32,770
random variable X. So I mean you. Normalized by

287
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:38,900
end times, various. Of that individual random

288
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,930
variable. With this overall factor out, front is

289
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:47,580
required to ensure the usual condition that's

290
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,580
integrating over over the sole domain of real

291
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,240
numbers for X adds up to one hundred percent.

292
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,200
So.

293
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,560
Again, there's no mathematical statements of one

294
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,210
equation. Are we still sitting here? Two, the

295
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,690
probability distribution. And then there's also

296
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,000
the question of what does that mathematical

297
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,770
equation mean and why does it matter? And.

298
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,560
Essentially, there are.

299
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,770
Two important implications coming out of this,

300
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,350
this mathematical statement, the first of which

301
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:45,500
being that when we consider this large number of

302
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,820
repetitions, which shortly we will identify with

303
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,330
that large number of particles that we have said

304
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,960
thermodynamic systems, the overall collective

305
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,290
behavior of all these particles is the smooth

306
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:05,540
function. That's just the normal distribution that

307
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:10,250
can be defined without reference to any individual

308
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,370
properties of those individual particles, apart

309
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:17,690
from the mean and variance expectation values

310
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,560
governing the probability distribution as a whole.

311
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,070
And maybe even more remarkable is that. That

312
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,870
collective behavior, in addition to being

313
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,530
independent of the details of what each individual

314
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,280
particle is doing at this point in time still only

315
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,800
depends on the details of those individual

316
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,460
particles in the form of the mean and standard

317
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,360
deviation for the individual random variable.

318
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:58,960
Without. And worried about. How they might be

319
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,850
interacting or interfering with each other.

320
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:11,580
And back earlier in the week, the. Talked about

321
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:17,370
Roulet as a somewhat less trivial example of a

322
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,250
probabilistic system compared to flipping a coin

323
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,190
to roll the dice. And we can use that same

324
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:30,910
Goulette example. To see in practice that. The

325
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,950
large and the large number of repetitions in which

326
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,440
the central limit theorem is fairly well defined

327
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,850
doesn't necessarily need to be so large in

328
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:44,420
practice. We you're talking about 10, 20, 30

329
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,290
molecules in the statistical systems, but the

330
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,600
central limit theorem itself can become

331
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:59,660
remarkably accurate even when that number is much

332
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:06,040
smaller. Order a few, order 10, some, just as a

333
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:14,200
quick reminder of that left, we all we have thirty

334
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,750
seven pockets, 18 red, 18 black or green, each of

335
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,180
which has the corresponding number that determines

336
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:28,740
what color is. And a game that we can play with

337
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:34,840
real is to place a bet on whether or not the the

338
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:40,540
ball that we will end up in a red color pocket or

339
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,330
black for pocket after we spin the wheel of the

340
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,960
ball around, actually settles into one of those

341
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,080
pockets. And if we guess the correct color, we

342
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,600
could get back twice the money that we put in.

343
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,440
Otherwise, the money goes to the house. And just

344
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,270
to please concrete numbers on this, we can say

345
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:11,690
that we five pounds each spin the real. And then

346
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:17,190
we would get back 10 whatever, take out a total of

347
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,260
10, whatever deal ends up on the we bet on,

348
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,380
otherwise the money is gone. And from that, we can

349
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:34,010
define the gain. As a function of the number of

350
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,160
spins of the roulette wheel, that number of times

351
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,000
that we do this bets and as a function of the

352
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,710
number of those times where we win. So the first

353
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,500
thing to write down, just a reminder, what is the

354
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,960
probability of winning or losing any single spin

355
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,080
and maybe just to.

356
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:04,060
Checking that from the same page, can I ask you to.

357
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,570
Tell me what. Those probabilities.

358
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:25,680
But.

359
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,930
Glossed over the detail here, in addition to the

360
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:53,190
amount that we built, we are bidding on black. So

361
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,740
winning corresponds to a ball ending up in a black

362
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,740
pocket after the real.

363
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,320
But which there is a well-defined probability.

364
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,020
What is it?

365
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,840
It is exactly that

366
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,110
and we know that the probability of losing is

367
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,060
every other outcomes, so not only about ending up

368
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,850
the great pockets, but also in that single green

369
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:36,030
pocket. So there are slightly. More likely to lose

370
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,940
than to win, which was the case in any.

371
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:46,040
Gambling set up, the house always wins in the end.

372
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:52,240
And for each of these possibilities, we can gain.

373
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,530
Some announced that its possibly negative if we

374
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:04,470
lose, the game is being defined to be the net flow

375
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,700
of cash.

376
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,330
And as we place these bets, so what is the game if

377
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,500
we win?

378
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,230
Lieutenant.

379
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:45,780
But he was 15, so it's the amount we receive minus

380
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:51,150
the amount we spend. So if we spend five, that's

381
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,540
that minus sign. And if we receive twice of five,

382
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:05,200
when we will, we get a 10 and I can see where 15

383
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,300
comes out of there by having those two numbers

384
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:13,270
here with the definition, is that minus sign that

385
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:19,690
takes it from ten minus five to plus five. But

386
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,420
there's a similar game. That can be defined. The

387
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:28,510
slightly, slightly more probable situation that we

388
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,020
lose.

389
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:38,650
What that game would be. You bet on black and the

390
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,400
ball ends up in retrograde.

391
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,100
Well, that's exactly.

392
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,750
We always get that fire back goes out of our

393
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,030
pockets, so it's a negative number and then we

394
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,660
gain nothing

395
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:05,330
from that. Walk right down the corridor, gain

396
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:13,910
after. Waiting times in hospitals so that in times.

397
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:20,260
To regain the function. Of.

398
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:23,680
W.

399
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,670
So. This is the.

400
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:40,040
Winnings from the wins, minus the number of bets

401
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,150
that have to go in for each of those and spins. So

402
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:49,220
is be one shot at what? That would be as a

403
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,610
equation, mathematical function.

404
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:26,750
To on Tuesday night. Oh, yeah, that is. Exactly

405
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:30,050
what it is, so we've put in that fire for this

406
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,290
global scale. That's the two times five is ten.

407
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,740
That's the factor of two. Exactly. So the winnings

408
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:44,220
are. Ten pounds for win, which is twice the. Five

409
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:48,360
pounds, and that goes in for each pet.

410
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,190
So that is. What we would get out if we were to.

411
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,270
When The York Times out of ten spins of this

412
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:08,180
roulette game and the next ingredient to bid is to

413
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,420
figure out the probabilities of winning those 30

414
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,190
times, for instance. So we have to keep track of

415
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,910
the number of different ways we could win the war

416
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,210
times and total spins. And because we don't care

417
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,520
about the order of those occurrences in which we

418
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,240
want, the total number of possibilities is.

419
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:34,500
Exactly, defined by the binomial coefficient. The

420
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:39,150
fraction the number of possible ways of choosing

421
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:46,170
W. events out of the total set of events, so.

422
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,120
We give them a wipe down. Yeah, if we set and it

423
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,730
was five, something small enough that we can. Go

424
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,620
through these calculations, my head without too

425
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:10,310
much. We have six probabilities overall for

426
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:17,840
winning either one of those spins, all five of

427
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,980
those spins and all four possibilities in between.

428
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,510
And you can.

429
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,650
Consider maybe a simple case is the overall

430
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:38,590
probability of losing all five states, so winning

431
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:43,030
zero, that subscript here is the number of wins.

432
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:50,430
And then if you tell me the probability of winning

433
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,890
zero spins out of.

434
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,770
The total fire that we're doing, so losing every

435
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,390
single one in a row.

436
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:15,480
But

437
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,950
it is exactly that. So.

438
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:29,120
The probability of losing a single spin you

439
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,640
computed up there, you just have to repeat that

440
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,430
five times in a row each time with that same

441
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:40,110
probability. And if you go to. Winning a single

442
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,350
one of those since then, what we do is we bring in.

443
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:51,000
The probability of winning. One time. And. Losing

444
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,760
the other four, but then because there are five

445
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:03,030
spins and we could win. Any one of them. There is

446
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,230
a factor of five that comes along to keep track of

447
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,560
each of those possibilities, we the first or the

448
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,830
third, the fifth and the others. And we can

449
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:22,560
recognize that five and generalize the whole

450
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,440
situation at this point to

451
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,580
the. For instance, with W. winds, there are inches

452
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:40,110
w possible combinations where. Probability of

453
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:45,880
winning is that 18 over thirty seven. W power.

454
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:54,960
And. The probability of losing its 19 over 37 in

455
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,950
all of the other spins and miles from that

456
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:03,480
equation. It's easy that you keep writing down the

457
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,860
general pattern. Probability of winning two is

458
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,450
five, Tchoupitoulas, 10.

459
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:18,030
18 or 37 square and then another 37 to the power

460
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,830
three. You can win.

461
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:28,350
Three, four or five. There are 10 ways of winning

462
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:32,040
three, five ways of winning for a single way of

463
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,730
winning five. The military is coming in.

464
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:43,290
Winning. Two, three, four, five.

465
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,490
Spins and losing.

466
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:56,520
All of the others in this case is 19 over thirty

467
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,820
seven to the power is zero this morning. So that's

468
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:04,770
the exact probabilities and the wind along with

469
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:11,560
the corresponding gains. Of winning these all the

470
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,050
possible outcomes of five spins of what we bet on

471
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,460
black with five contests that we win, that's the

472
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:27,820
entire setup. And now we can bring that central

473
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:33,670
limit theorem to bear and write down the

474
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:43,650
probability distribution for gaining some kind of

475
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:52,330
some game after those and spins. So just to repeat.

476
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,520
The definition of the word would be the same, the

477
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,460
probability of the central limit theorem, it gives

478
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,080
this probability distribution of one over a square

479
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:13,910
to PI and various times the exponential of

480
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,230
fluctuations of the game around in times that mean

481
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:26,490
square normalized by. What is and times the

482
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:31,420
variance and the exponential. So all we need to

483
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:39,250
figure out is the mean and variance for that

484
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,470
single round of this experiment we're repeating of

485
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,240
betting five pounds of black and skipping the

486
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,930
roulette wheel.

487
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,780
Mr.. Illustration.

488
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,830
You can write down that mean again, but

489
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,770
considering all of the possible outcomes of that

490
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:12,810
single spin of the roulette wheel and the

491
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,310
corresponding probabilities.

492
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,750
Remember that this was X squared her back a

493
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:25,890
discrete outcomes. So we are studying the outcomes

494
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:30,730
and probabilities, which are exactly what we have

495
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:34,390
computed previously. So we have what we need the

496
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,000
gain if we win these five,

497
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,560
the probability of winning a single spin is 18

498
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,880
over twenty seven to gain. If we lose, it's minus

499
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,460
five probability of doing so, 19 over thirty seven.

500
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:59,290
And that is better even I can do in my head. It is

501
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,620
a mean of minus five of the thirty seven, but I

502
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,920
can't do my hands put that into digits just to

503
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,120
keep and keep track of what the rough scale is

504
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:15,490
about. Zero point one three five. So as expected

505
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,330
the.

506
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:22,410
The main outcome of this game is for us to lose

507
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:27,910
money and then. We can do a similar calculation

508
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:34,130
for. The expectation value with X squared, that

509
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,070
feeds into the various.

510
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:45,630
Is anyone willing and able to shout out what this

511
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:50,490
might look like? Even if we repeat the individual

512
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,310
steps for the.

513
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:25,280
In the interest of propping up the few remaining

514
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,790
minutes, you say that it's the same process of

515
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:32,750
selling over all of the two outcomes in all of

516
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:36,200
that space and here instead of.

517
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:42,230
Reading those the corresponding probabilities by.

518
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:49,020
X. We just by X squared. So five squared is twenty

519
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:54,400
five and minus five squared is also twenty five in

520
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,620
particular, plus twenty five is the negative side

521
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:04,440
scan sonar, which we can see eighteen plus

522
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,670
nineteen is thirty seven and twenty five. Is that

523
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:14,770
so. So. If I have space left to write down the

524
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:19,990
variance, it is the expectation value of the

525
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:23,890
square. Twenty five minus the square of the

526
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:29,750
expectation value, which is. Five over thirty

527
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:33,540
seven squared, which is quite close to twenty five

528
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,010
barbarically, four points.

529
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:44,860
Ninety two, so if we put this into. Probability

530
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,100
distribution from the central theorem that comes

531
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:52,210
out to be this one over square root of two times

532
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:58,360
twenty four, forty eight to the one that is forty

533
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,100
nine ninety six point and.

534
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:15,340
In the. Exponential of gain minus has me so plus

535
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:23,060
zero point one three five. And squared. With

536
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:29,710
another factor of forty nine, ninety six and and.

537
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:37,440
Basically run out of time for today, and this is

538
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,940
something that may actually be useful to wrap up

539
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,950
in the Detroit of this afternoon, look at

540
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:48,440
programming is given this kind of.

541
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:55,320
Probability distribution with some fuzzy numbers

542
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,740
in there. We have to extract actual probabilities

543
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,760
from that. We do that by integrating over

544
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,190
appropriate regions. So

545
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:11,430
some small Beltagy around the game you're

546
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,290
interested in and.

547
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:19,340
And this numerical integration is exactly the kind

548
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:24,950
of thing that computers were built to do, so we

549
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:28,820
will revisit this along with other aspects of

550
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,850
computer programming in a few hours. And we could

551
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:35,840
be just wrap up now by seeing if there are any

552
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:38,960
quick questions about what we've gone through

553
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:44,360
today. The law of large numbers to probability

554
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,310
distributions of a central theorem.

555
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:58,440
Saying, I'll let you go and see them all again

556
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,750
later this afternoon.
