1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:09,330
All right, that's the recording started and we can get

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,930
set up with the six digit code for this morning.

3
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,840
It is seven three zero zero

4
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,160
five nine.

5
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:37,000
And welcome to a warm, sunny Friday morning. A very---well,

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,490
congratulations on getting through that computer

7
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,450
project. So that's most of the in-term assessment

8
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,200
dealt with. Just one final homework assignment

9
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,890
that will be showing up in your inbox during the

10
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,800
break and due the second week we come back, in early

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,370
May. Are there any questions about what we've been

12
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,220
going through recently before we pick up wrapping

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,090
up the photon gas and moving on to quantum gases of fermions,

14
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,230
which is the plan for today, or at least for

15
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:16,140
this morning.  In the afternoon, we may well look at

16
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,360
taking a step back to the canonical ensemble and

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,400
look at the heat capacity of a

18
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,320
statistical model of solids.  I have a few

19
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,740
hours to figure out if that will be interesting or

20
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,330
there's anything better to do more directly

21
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,200
related to what's been happening this week.

22
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:39,960
And

23
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,860
it's to get underway with a quick recap, since

24
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,380
it's been a few days last year at the.

25
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,500
From the 5th of March, that's where the cameras

26
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:57,950
point to.

27
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,190
So we've been looking at the full time gas in the

28
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:12,380
grand canonical ensemble as a system of massless

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,120
photons.

30
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,600
Because the particles are massless, their energies

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,630
are given by their angular frequency, is working

32
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,830
with wavelengths rather than P squared over two in

33
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,350
the classical case, and we have to drive the

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,480
so-called Planck spectrum. Or it's called black

35
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,830
body radiation. The photons emitted by an object

36
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,500
at a given temperature.

37
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,020
Without any contamination from reflecting evidence

38
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,610
for plants and found in particular, that spectrum

39
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,990
is proportional to. The ratio of that frequency

40
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:10,710
cubed divided by E to the minus one, whereas in

41
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,960
the classical limit you end up with something

42
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,670
proportional to. How big a square that that would

43
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,240
diverge a little bit of large frequency's a mega

44
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,780
or short wavelengths, so that is known as the

45
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,260
ultraviolet catastrophe. Of.

46
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,350
Classical treatments of the energy of a mass of

47
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,910
photons or radiation. And we checked this against.

48
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,660
With the solar radiation

49
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,090
emitted by the sun, the temperature around. Little

50
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,080
under six thousand.

51
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,360
As well as the cosmic microwave background,

52
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,580
radiation is very low temperature.

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,970
Photons left over from the Big Bang about 14

54
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,360
billion years ago, finding, despite our assumption

55
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,890
of not interacting, ideal gases, good descriptions

56
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,160
of that data. From in both of those regimes of the

57
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,840
high-temperature solar radiation and the low

58
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,740
temperature cosmic microwave background, we went

59
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:34,760
on to find that. The overall energy density coming

60
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,250
from the black spectrum, sharing out the overall

61
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,100
frequencies is proportional to. These see the

62
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,180
power 40, so that's very different from the

63
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,700
relativistic energy disproportionality tea this

64
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,650
gave us. A.

65
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,630
Well, but it's going to give us today is entropy

66
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,200
and the heat capacity, both of which are

67
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,000
proportional to Cube rather than in case the heat

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,970
capacity getting constants like the classical

69
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,040
relativistic gas and the interest in the entropy

70
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,750
is connected to the radiation pressure that we

71
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,490
started discussing at the end of Tuesday's lecture

72
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,900
and will pick up to push through the last steps to

73
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,840
the full equation of states for the first time

74
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,410
yesterday. Today, if we are happy with what we've

75
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,760
gotten up to so far, there is the. Dependence on

76
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,810
the internal energy, that photon gas on.

77
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,710
The fourth power, the temperature which we can

78
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,860
relate through the last calculation that we did on

79
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,280
Tuesday to the average number of photons with the

80
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,460
energy chemical potential reflecting the ease of

81
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,920
creating and destroying photons. That, like the

82
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,250
heat capacity, is proportional to three towers of

83
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,380
the temperature with interesting factors of gamma

84
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,370
functions in Zyda functions, showing up from

85
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,840
carrying out these intervals over that spectrum

86
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,840
and by looking at the.

87
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,730
Usual expression we have for the Entropia related

88
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,640
to the internal energy, the free energy normalized

89
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,930
by the temperature in the case of the ensemble

90
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,990
with the energy chemical potential. We can confirm

91
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:57,640
that this entropy is almost the times here. That's

92
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,680
exactly what we wrapped up on Tuesday.

93
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,670
This is the condition of constant entropy that

94
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:11,200
needs to go into the determination of the

95
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,470
radiation pressure. We take the derivative of the

96
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:19,450
photon energy with respect to the. Volume of the

97
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:19,890
system,

98
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:28,390
indeed, is even easier to see that the dimensions

99
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,580
of the entropy would get to be the type of CQ

100
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,890
there is a rather complicated integral involving

101
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:41,440
more of one minus Ticketfly, the sex that having

102
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,370
cast everything into dimensionless quantities like

103
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:53,410
this X because the photon energy is Omega divided

104
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,480
by the temperature. That's where the factor of

105
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,840
teen Kud gets pulled out of this overall integral.

106
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,740
Which suffices to determine the condition of

107
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:11,500
constant entropy that we can plug in to free

108
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,610
expression for the injury to the power for. Now

109
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:25,470
has to satisfy the relation to that tier is some

110
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,600
constant times the inverse cube root of the volume

111
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,890
we call that tends to be then playing in

112
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:45,990
relation here. So. For the cost of factories of.

113
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:52,200
Minus PI squared and over 15 each passing year

114
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,640
cubed. Out front of this derivative, which is then

115
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,750
one power of times negative for two thirds power

116
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,380
towers V.. So there is a cost to be to the forward

117
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,940
and left over. The two year. Minus one third kids

118
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,470
looking out.

119
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,570
One of those negative for three hours from the

120
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,660
fourth power of the constant entropy relation to

121
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,370
the derivative of V to the power, minus a third is

122
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:34,440
just. Minus a third times, one over, obviously,

123
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,470
the negative signs cancel. This expression,

124
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:46,370
constant factors of high squared over 15 each bar

125
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:53,390
scene cubed through. As does the of the 4th and

126
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:59,030
getting. Moved, the new power of water will be up

127
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,140
front, the original V to the minus one third is

128
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,880
still in place, which we can recognize as.

129
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,470
One over three times, because I think the average

130
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,720
internal energy of the folks on gas when we

131
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,300
started off with. So multiplying through by the

132
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,110
volume, we find an equation of state that looks

133
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,250
very nearly like the ideal gas law we had for

134
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,270
classical non relativistic gases all the way back

135
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:38,010
in for the chemical ensemble. Where the pressure

136
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,110
times volume is just one third of the internal

137
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,590
energy, which we have related to a constant factor.

138
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,310
Times the average particle number. Times the

139
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,280
temperature of the gas in the classical case, the

140
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,280
ideal gas was PV equals a. the fixed and

141
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,190
economical cycle. And the only change in this

142
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,480
equation, 98 compared to that, is this funny

143
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,870
looking pretty factor that depends on the remote

144
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,010
data function. And the fact is a ratio of two

145
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,670
different values of the remote signal function

146
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,590
zero four divided by zero of three, which is

147
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:31,200
related to actually the dimensionality that the. I

148
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,780
guess occupies three dimensional space, the total

149
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,050
number is proportional to the three, and the

150
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,690
internal energy brings in an additional factor of

151
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,800
Omega in these sorts of integrals over frequency

152
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,260
that we've been doing, pulling out zero for very

153
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,670
few of those. Is that showing up in the equation

154
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,480
of state. So if we were to imagine photon gas is

155
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,490
confined to some surface, you would expect to have

156
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,140
the same sort of ideal gas law type relation with.

157
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,290
Some different ratio of data functions coming up

158
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,180
at the cost of the proportionality test, maybe

159
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:25,840
getting a little far away from the mainstream of

160
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:32,200
this module, and this indeed is our destination

161
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,750
for the photon gas, at least for the time being,

162
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,010
having derived.

163
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,780
All of the usual observables, the internal energy

164
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,680
density, every particle, no entropy and equation

165
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,040
of state involving radiation pressure, and we will

166
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,270
now set some time to decide and turn to quantum

167
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,890
gases at fermions unless there are any questions

168
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,240
about the topic of these photon gases or those

169
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,460
other quantum gases more generally.

170
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:19,430
And to switch things up a bit and keep from. Re

171
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,030
doing the same thing with slightly different

172
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,740
negative signs, let's look for the most part, abs

173
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,030
gas's of. I'm not attractive, but also not

174
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,400
relativistic fermions.

175
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,650
And again, this is being investigated through

176
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,320
quantum statistics as a reminder, this defines the

177
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,850
microstates by considering energy levels in turn,

178
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,770
something over all of the possible occupation

179
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,550
numbers for each of those energy levels, which

180
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,960
would be for on a case, are restricted to being

181
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,160
either empty or filled, unoccupied or occupied

182
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,470
energy levels. The poverty exclusion principle

183
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,850
forbids the identical fermions in this case from

184
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,530
occupying that same energy level and in the

185
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,710
previous units, seven derived. So-called fair

186
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:26,660
statistics. That governs the statistical behavior

187
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:31,790
of these gases of one's. The starting point for

188
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,260
the statistics is with all. Sophistical ensembles

189
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,880
is the corresponding production function. As this

190
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,930
form of product over all of the energy levels

191
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,660
which we can label as running from zero to some

192
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,200
accountable but possibly infinite L

193
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,150
and then. Some factor of one plus or minus two

194
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,200
times the difference between the energy value of

195
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,810
the corresponding energy level, minus the chemical

196
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,410
potential.

197
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:17,790
Where this is clearly connected to the two

198
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,920
possible occupation numbers, which is energy

199
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,180
levels when a energy level is occupied. The

200
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,150
exponential factor reduces to one when it is

201
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:32,110
occupied, it corresponds to this exponential

202
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,880
factor of ratio of energy, the temperatures. And

203
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,910
unlike the movies, I have seen statistics where

204
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,320
the convergence of the partition function required

205
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,340
that the energy be larger than the chemical

206
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,310
potential, every single energy level, there is no

207
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:57,920
such restriction in February statistics and. We

208
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,040
really need to see that both negative and positive

209
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:07,210
values of the chemical potential are. Realized in

210
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:12,820
nature, that's in contrast to the system of

211
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,130
photons we were just considering, we argued that

212
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,890
the ease with which we can create and absorb

213
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,030
photons corresponded to a chemical potential, that.

214
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,830
Effectively vanishes, so the corresponding

215
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:32,390
economic potential arising from. This protection

216
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:37,530
function. It is just now the sun over the lot of

217
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,380
these factors, one plus the exponential

218
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,050
based on which we want to determine the same sort

219
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,180
of energy, the same sort of quantities we were

220
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,600
looking for the first time, gas, internal energy,

221
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,990
average particle, no entropy pressure in the state.

222
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,890
And what we need to do to start off with this is

223
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:04,720
specify precisely what these energies showing up

224
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,530
in the energy levels are going to these violations,

225
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:14,380
including any degeneracy where we have distinct

226
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,290
energy levels with the same value of the energy

227
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,270
and the case of the.

228
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,980
Photon, yes, we had massless particles with energy

229
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,170
is given by their frequency. Here are the numbers

230
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:35,450
in the case. We go back to that limit in science

231
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,130
triangle, the

232
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,130
the mass energy and momentum energy can expand

233
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,730
that for momentum that are very small compared to

234
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:50,710
masses and find the usual kinetic energy from

235
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,500
classical mechanics squared divided by two, where

236
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,400
quantization filaments in a volume cube, as usual,

237
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,620
gives us. Energy's. Of the same formerly. Reviewed

238
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,030
in section April one earlier this week, it cost

239
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,600
the factor four squared squared times, PI split

240
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,670
over to end Times Square, that system multiplied

241
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:27,480
by. The square magnitude of non-negative, that's

242
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,530
really positive integers. Why is that label

243
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,070
possible so that these numbers of particles can

244
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,880
have each of the three spatial directions?

245
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,320
So therefore, the generosity is now coming from

246
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,170
permutations of those.

247
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,290
Different possible ways we can have, say, six

248
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,860
units of momentum oriented in different directions,

249
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,550
X, Y or Z, we calibrated those at the start of

250
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:09,240
this unit and whereas photons had. To generate

251
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,920
energy levels for. Each sets of vector Numenta.

252
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,700
That corresponds to polarizations fermions is

253
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:26,660
typical for males have a similar degeneracy. So

254
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:32,510
for any fixed millennial vector, there are two

255
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,780
degenerate energy levels with the same energy, a

256
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,550
different by a quantum property that is called

257
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:43,700
spin rather than the two hybridization states. And

258
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:50,630
we have four photons. And spin is. Related to

259
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,820
angular momentum, but it's potentially misleading

260
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,700
terminology because we shouldn't picture these

261
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,840
four year olds as actually. It's an intrinsic

262
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,440
property.

263
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,870
That they possess where? Particles such as

264
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,890
electrons exist in one of the two states either

265
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:16,240
spin or spin down with the same level as the

266
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,810
corresponding to the same energy in the state

267
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,570
energy levels. This is the same spin that showed

268
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,810
up in the spin statistics theorem we mentioned in

269
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:31,530
introducing photons and fermions. And I think

270
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,720
he'll say no more about that now what we can

271
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,860
discuss it further, if there is interest, just

272
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,590
like the organization that's going to suffice to

273
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,820
take this as input, that all of the energy levels

274
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:51,950
with. These novelistic energies come in, spin up,

275
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,270
spin down the parents, and for typical fermions of

276
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:01,790
those two distinct values for the spin. So all we

277
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:08,260
need to do. To get under way is insert these

278
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,690
energies into the great economic potential for

279
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,030
seven, which is written down here.

280
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:22,910
And that overall factor of two from the two spin

281
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,650
states and then the launch of one plus the

282
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:31,100
exponential of a larger expression that now

283
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:36,730
depends on. The magnitude of the incident led to a

284
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,730
case squared with the usual factors that are

285
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,340
critical mass and elsewhere, all divided by the

286
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,050
temperature.

287
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:47,630
James.

288
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,740
Put in that form of temperature, rather than being

289
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,250
beat up to remind you that this is the. Sort of

290
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,340
expressions we came up with in terms of the

291
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,610
different wavelengths that we were considering,

292
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,600
the classical ideal gases, and for the difference

293
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,800
now being that we have. Some or all of the

294
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,520
intricacies of the logarithm of this factor,

295
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,780
rather than having to take a classical approach,

296
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,010
consider back then of analyzing the single

297
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,970
particle production function and then. Trying to

298
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,230
build a gas, many particles based on that.

299
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:41,000
We are going to proceed in the same way we did

300
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,480
with the time approximate this complicated sum

301
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,970
over three vector memento by. Approximating that

302
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,540
some over integers by integrals over us real

303
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,630
numbers, something that we can justify at least

304
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,620
when the gas is in a large volume compared to.

305
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,620
It's. The other factors that show up in this

306
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,520
energy, in particular, each bar is a very small

307
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,680
number and then that gives us instead of something

308
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:24,050
over it, why is it? We can integrate over a the

309
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:29,130
parameters that show up in the continuous energy.

310
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,530
We can convert to spiritual coordinates as the.

311
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,960
Factor being integrated, so the grant here depends

312
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,690
only on the magnitude of these momentum vectors.

313
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:54,900
So the anger and the just pull out the same solid

314
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,950
angle corresponding to the positive content of the

315
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:04,260
sphere. So one eighth of the sphere, the solid

316
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,770
angle for PI will use a factor of PI has. So the

317
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:14,150
overall expression for the economic potential for

318
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,950
this non militaristic firm, Yungas.

319
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,200
Reduce this to a trickle just over the magnitude

320
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,680
of the momentum. Of this expression, the board of

321
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,890
one, plus the exponential of that.

322
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,920
Negative data on this view all divided by the

323
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,760
temperature.

324
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:43,690
And.

325
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,090
We can simplify this sort of expression by

326
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,570
changing variables much in the way that we did to

327
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,360
convert the full time gas integration to

328
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,920
integration over the total frequencies that showed

329
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,040
up linearly and the energy we now want to.

330
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:10,070
Integrate over the similar dependence on the phone

331
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,110
you call the administration variable, that now

332
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,070
depends quite radically on the mentality's

333
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:24,920
particles. So if we invert this relation between.

334
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,960
Momentum and energy and the variables we want to

335
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,230
work with are going to be. The cat, which is.

336
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,060
Factor of the square root of L squared is just 12

337
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:47,630
square root, divided by high times, Planck's

338
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:52,530
constant and then. Another square root of two

339
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:58,020
times the energy. This is what we want to replace.

340
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,360
The factors of Khap Square to show up in the

341
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,580
center for the Dark had itself is then the

342
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,610
derivative of the square root of the energy which

343
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:19,770
brings down. A factor of two that cancels out half

344
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:24,420
of that square root to factor in the numerator and

345
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,950
pay for counseling comes along for the ride and

346
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,670
then e to the power one half if we reduce that

347
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,120
down.

348
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,230
By one factor of energy, it again cancels out half

349
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,360
of that square root of the numerator and left with

350
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:46,890
it one over square root in the denominator with

351
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:50,730
the differential factor long. So putting all of

352
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,330
this in.

353
00:26:54,390 --> 00:27:02,570
We have negative TV times. Three powers of this

354
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:08,260
council prefecture them over age. So.

355
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:17,410
Scrappiness, Altuve. The three have spoken of MICU.

356
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,800
Each party room.

357
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,830
The limits of integration stay the same, the

358
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:28,550
energy vanishes when much of vanishes, diverges

359
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:36,260
with averages. We have over all the roots to the

360
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:43,740
times that need to be squared has squared and in

361
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:49,070
the logarithmic factor, which is much simpler now

362
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,160
that this combination.

363
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,850
Quantities is is just the ratio of energy and

364
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:06,270
temperature, so it's back to. So that. Looks

365
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:10,020
fairly familiar energy minus chemical potential

366
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:15,270
divided by temperature. Now the energy is the

367
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,440
integration variable we are integrating over. We

368
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:27,680
can simplify. This result. I did find that a huge

369
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:34,370
factor is the volume working in. So pulling out. A

370
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:39,020
square root to factor. The difference between

371
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:46,290
those two. So a negative route to this square root

372
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:51,670
cubed. We have the volume, we have a temperature,

373
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,790
the high humidity and huge variety of factors come

374
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:02,950
along for the ride. Then there is just the water,

375
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,250
the.

376
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,670
One plus the exponential, the sticks and the

377
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,100
Google factor of the square root of the energy

378
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:25,640
left over from this. Ratio of energy terms in case

379
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,360
squared, divided by the room to the differential

380
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:29,950
factor.

381
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:36,560
So the overall proportionality to that building in

382
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,600
times temperature is the same as the photon gas.

383
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:47,970
And there are obvious differences, both in the

384
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,020
relative sign that shows up in the logarithm as

385
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,830
well as the overall square root energy factor

386
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,050
coming to the normal mystic nature of these

387
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:04,360
particles. And we can proceed now to take the

388
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:10,060
usual derivatives of the economic potential and

389
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,960
then evaluate this integral after doing so.

390
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:21,300
Which is the same approach that we took from the

391
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:26,880
photographs with different factors. Different

392
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,300
expressions show in the. Objects being integrated

393
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:31,700
over.

394
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:39,330
So our target for. This from Yungas, much as it

395
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:42,360
was for the folks on the West, will be the

396
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,050
equation of the state relating all of the large

397
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,810
scale thermodynamic properties that we want to

398
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:49,380
drive.

399
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,350
And what big change that we can see in this

400
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,360
expression here compared to the full time gas, is

401
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:04,560
that we need to retain the chemical potential. We

402
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:11,730
can argue that it is negligible in the case of non

403
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:16,260
relativistic fermions that are not necessarily

404
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,920
easy to create. And so in contrast to photons.

405
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,960
But we will be able to simplify our calculations

406
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:30,640
in a different way if we focus on the low

407
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,010
temperature regime, which in any event is the

408
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,610
interesting regime. Or we can expect different

409
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,450
behavior compared to the classical dresses we've

410
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:49,750
already analyzed. Is at high temperatures that the

411
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,120
quantum physics reduces to classical actual

412
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:00,960
statistics. And we can expect is still an to

413
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,300
reduce to classical thermodynamics of non

414
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,910
relativistic particles without having to specify

415
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:15,360
any quantum behavior or dependence on the nature

416
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,640
of these particles, asteroids.

417
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,460
So.

418
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,960
As a first step towards this equation, the

419
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:32,270
statement illustrates the simplification that we

420
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,460
can get by working at low temperatures.

421
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,920
Rather than talking about the spectrum of the

422
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,310
system, the look first at the average particle

423
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:47,450
number given by the negative derivative of the

424
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,400
Grand Canal, the full potential with respect to

425
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,070
chemical potential. That's the relation between

426
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,030
the lived in Unit six.

427
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,030
And even though we're not looking at the spectrum,

428
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:00,900
we'll still.

429
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:06,340
Be motivated by some analogy to that to express

430
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,580
the average particle density so the number of

431
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,910
particles on average per unit volume as an

432
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:18,760
integral over the energies of the individual

433
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,570
fermions in this gas. So we'll be interested in

434
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,970
the integrated. The function that shows up in the

435
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,490
integral that would have. Left hanging around to

436
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,490
carry out some of this work. She goes by the name

437
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:44,130
of the family function named after the same Enrico

438
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:50,420
Fermi as Fairmont's themselves. There is some

439
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:55,910
contrast to that spectrum caps, the overall

440
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,510
factors that you consider to include a place where

441
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,230
each bar cube separates.

442
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,760
Well. The family function, as well as that split

443
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:14,810
energy, we are here and I noticed that I did have

444
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:19,950
a typo in this little calculation where. Puyehue

445
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:24,170
to the denominator cancels partly with the overall

446
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:28,520
pie coming from the salad angle and we integrate

447
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,450
over in momentum space so there's always pie

448
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:38,330
squared times each barbecue in the denominator of

449
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,680
the grand finale potential.

450
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,150
So.

451
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:51,060
If we insert that result for economic potential

452
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,710
that we just. Derived, we can extract the Fairbury

453
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,220
function.

454
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,990
So pulling out. Fear that negative grew to include

455
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,340
both high school graduates, particularly the

456
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:12,050
negatives, cancel, get that positive. To include.

457
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:18,330
Overpriced beach bar cubed, the factor of volume

458
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:24,030
we divide out, so only a tower of T remains and

459
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,030
then we're integrating over the energies of the

460
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,880
derivative with respect to chemical potential. But

461
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:37,300
this log of one plus. Exponential factor. Times

462
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:42,520
the additional square root of energy. So taking

463
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,730
the derivative.

464
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,430
Of that board will bring down, first of all, the

465
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,710
argument of going into the denominator so much

466
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,230
less due to the minus beta,

467
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,270
minus the. And then pulling through the chain to

468
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:13,650
pick up the data. My view, the derivative of

469
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,980
either the plus B, the Times view with respect to

470
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,620
the two, is the initial factor of data. The

471
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,670
inverse temperature cancels out the direct

472
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,960
temperature to be had. Outside of the integral.

473
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:35,210
Seeking independence at the end. Which we can.

474
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,790
Ben. Clean up slightly by dividing through the

475
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,350
multiplying by the ratio of expenditures

476
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,350
in the plus meter in this new.

477
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,580
Squared each Teichberg cube.

478
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,930
So we end up then with first one. No need to be

479
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:16,320
the. E minus two plus one times e t e. Which if we

480
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,270
compare that to the equation 99, defining the

481
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,000
family function is the integration of the average

482
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,240
particle density.

483
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,390
With respect to energy, we can read off. The

484
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:35,270
family function is exactly.

485
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:44,690
This one over. Exponential factor. Positive. Even

486
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,940
as New Yorkers have the juror plus one,

487
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,200
which. As promised is.

488
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,130
Very similar to the average occupation number for.

489
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,620
The energy level with this energy that we are

490
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,580
intervening over.

491
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,460
If we look back to the calculation we did for

492
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,970
demographics, logistics in general and the

493
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,380
previous units. So what is way of organizing the

494
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:26,130
calculations doing is. Relating the average number

495
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:30,700
of particles that we have given the volume to. The

496
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:35,590
energy levels with a given infinitesimal range of

497
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,280
energies.

498
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:44,450
That's. Comes in with the average occupation

499
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,510
number as a function of the energy, not so

500
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,010
surprisingly, but then an additional factor of a

501
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:54,020
square root of energy. And that integration, which

502
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,740
is something that people need to look at a bit

503
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:02,270
more closely as we go forward. First, I promised

504
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:06,050
some simplification for considering this average

505
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,870
protocol, no density at low temperatures, which we

506
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:17,030
are now in a position to realize by. Looking a bit

507
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:20,780
more closely at the Fairbury function, we just

508
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:24,110
arrived, and I'm particularly writing it in terms

509
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:28,280
of dimensionless ratios of this energy to the

510
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,740
chemical potential and the ratio of the

511
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,520
temperature of the chemical potential. So

512
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:40,530
replacing Beta with one Oberti. The overall

513
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,470
impression that we have one divided by this

514
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:48,580
exponential of E minus new over T plus one, if we

515
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,530
pull out the ratio of chemical potential over

516
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,300
temperature for both of those terms, is in the

517
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,050
exponential. We can break it up into a product of

518
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:04,920
two factors. And the exponential of the product is

519
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,810
exponential itself, raised to the power of those

520
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:15,040
products, so we end up with an exponential of. The

521
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,270
ratio of energy to potential minus one. All that

522
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:22,980
raised to the power of the ratio of chemical

523
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:29,900
essential to the temperature. And this is showing

524
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,660
us two main things, one of which depends on the

525
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:36,350
chemical essential temperature can be either

526
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,840
positive or negative, the other than depends on

527
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,570
the temperature for a fixed value of the chemical

528
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:47,130
potential. First of all, whenever the energy is

529
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,570
larger than the chemical potential, the argument

530
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,400
of this exponential is going to be positive. So

531
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,030
the explosion itself will be larger than one being

532
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:03,060
raised to some power that causes it to increase.

533
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:07,680
So an object to the one used to power, it's larger

534
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,520
still, which is the opposite of what happens if

535
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,880
the energy is less than the chemical potential.

536
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,090
This ratio is less than one. The arguments of the

537
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,310
exponential is negative and the expansion itself

538
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,070
is less than one, and then gets suppressed and

539
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:26,940
pushed closer to zero by this power that's being

540
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,990
raised to give by the ratio of chemical potential

541
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:34,650
to temperature and the larger the temperature.

542
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,330
The more suppression or enhancements this

543
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:46,750
exponential factor has. And depending on. Which

544
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:54,910
side of this points equals new reform also? Remark.

545
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,810
That's exactly when equals me and the exponential

546
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:05,570
reduces to unity based in the power of the family

547
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:11,940
function is exactly what has. One over one plus

548
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:18,180
one. What is the threshold where? The behavior of

549
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,340
the family function changes.

550
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,920
It's probably easiest to see by putting that

551
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:27,840
fairly function.

552
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:33,370
Versus this dimensionless ratio of energy to

553
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:38,800
chemical potential for. Various ratios of that

554
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,240
temperature to chemical potential. So the four

555
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,380
different lines here are corresponding to four

556
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:55,940
different values. Appreciate you over team that

557
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:01,640
showed up as the. Power hitting the exponential

558
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:07,940
factor in nominator of the function. So you over t

559
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:14,270
is going to be one to ten or one hundred for the

560
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:18,720
red and green, Blue and Black Crowes. That

561
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:24,480
Stoodley approach to behavior that we just

562
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,420
described by looking at the form of this motion

563
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:27,990
itself.

564
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:33,180
Now, whatever the energy is less than the chemical

565
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,630
potential, that's exponential factor is suppressed

566
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,740
and all that is left of the denominator is the

567
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:44,470
plus one. The family functions and approaches one

568
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:47,290
over one, which is one the maximum occupation

569
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,040
number that we can have for four months, the

570
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,980
opposite happens whenever the enemy is larger than

571
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,630
the chemical potential. The exponential factor

572
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:00,100
that is more the one who has this power increases

573
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,010
from one to two to ten to one hundred. That's

574
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,960
exponential. More than one gets larger and larger

575
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,670
and larger. So it's exponential suppression of the

576
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,480
function as a whole, driving it to zero. The other

577
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,660
element of an occupational.

578
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:29,020
So the. He here. Is that not only are we

579
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:33,460
interpolating between these two limited cases

580
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:39,760
where. They're all energy levels are filled with

581
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,540
occupation, number one, or empty occupation of

582
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:46,810
zero, and interpellation happens faster and faster

583
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:51,520
as the temperature gets lower with respect to the

584
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,880
kind of global financial ratio of new poverty

585
00:44:55,210 --> 00:45:00,530
becomes larger. And in the limits of. Low

586
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:03,800
temperatures where we're hitting that exponential

587
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,720
factor is much larger than one. We can approximate.

588
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:13,860
The security function as a whole is simply a step

589
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:19,540
function that changes. Essentially immediately

590
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:24,530
from being one for low energies to being zero for

591
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:27,220
all high energies and.

592
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,490
Before going on to apply that, just to wrap up

593
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:37,750
today, I should mention something that may already

594
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:44,140
have seen. And all of these all of the plots here,

595
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,940
the discussions with the treating the chemical

596
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:51,420
potentially as a positive under. So that we look

597
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:55,620
at energy is divided by you that are created in

598
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,890
zero and also looking at temperatures that are

599
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:04,080
greater than zero, and that is a contrast with the

600
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,040
classical limits of large negative chemical

601
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,760
potential we discussed earlier. So next Monday, we

602
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,950
will justify this self treatment of the kind of

603
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:21,350
global financial as. Be positive, no show why that

604
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:26,030
is actually required for now, we will just roll

605
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:29,760
with this and see what happens when we fly again,

606
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:32,300
this low temperature approximation.

607
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:40,700
For the family function as a step function in the

608
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,870
result that we've derived for the average, the

609
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:49,510
density just a few minutes ago, where now?

610
00:46:55,020 --> 00:47:01,200
We have from energies of zero up to new.

611
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:06,660
This security function is one to pick up the rest

612
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:13,050
of the integrated team and then for. And the

613
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:15,900
energy is larger than you at every function at

614
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,560
zero, the integral vanishes and we just have to

615
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,710
integrate from zero to the chemical potential

616
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:30,330
itself. The integral of Scooter Libby is a simple

617
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:37,640
one to compute. Council directors on. For the ride

618
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:42,540
and we end up with E to the power three halves,

619
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:48,560
raising the power of that argument by one and then

620
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,400
one over three heads, which is the transit's two

621
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,840
thirds evaluated at zero and the.

622
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,870
Which is below zero for the three 1/2 hour is zero.

623
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:08,260
And you, the three halves gives us a another.

624
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:13,930
However, three heads that we can combine with that

625
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:18,100
to an. So we end up with two and hundreds of

626
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:20,090
chemical potential onto the three house.

627
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:26,940
Providing that that's too with the factor of two

628
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:31,960
thirds will be integral and then a three. I swear

629
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,010
to each barbecued.

630
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,120
As the full result for the average particle, no

631
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:45,350
density, we will make extensive and build on on

632
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:45,860
Monday.

633
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:54,600
For now. Unless there are questions about

634
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,690
what we've been doing with the knowledge Mr..

635
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:04,160
Gaffes or why?

636
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:20,190
You're going to go wrap up there for the lectures

637
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,190
this week and have office hours now if.

638
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:29,360
The topics you want to discuss individually, so

639
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,130
hopefully I'll see you this afternoon, I think,

640
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:38,110
for some consideration of heat capacities, more

641
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,980
comparisons to experimental data.
