1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,900
So we've got the recording underway, and it's just about time

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,660
to start.  Are there any immediate questions from

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,870
earlier in the week before we get going?

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,220
While you're thinking about that, this is today's

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,720
magic number for the attendance system:  nine eight eight

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,340
one one zero.

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,430
There was some interesting discussion on the Canvas site

8
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,210
about whether the law of diffusion we saw a few days

9
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,680
ago, at the start of this week, has built into it an

10
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,110
assumption of large N, like the central limit

11
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,630
theorem. I think that it does, but I didn't prove

12
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,000
anything. If there are no questions about that or

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,720
other things, we can catch up a bit with what we

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,060
did on Tuesday and where we are now.

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,660
the micro-canonical ensemble

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,530
we saw earlier this week after wrapping up

17
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,500
the random box, which will see again in different

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,940
guises with the introduction of statistical

19
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,780
ensembles.

20
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,680
As is the particular example. Of the capability of

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,180
spaces we defined.

22
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:47,140
The. First unit for the force where. Is the key

23
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,120
idea behind this identification is that.

24
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,430
The time of ownership.

25
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,500
Of the degrees of freedom particles in this

26
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,440
ensemble. Our as leader, probabilistically, simply.

27
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:11,960
It's.

28
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,800
All of the possible spade's.

29
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:27,420
In the outcome space for this probably only space

30
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,700
and.

31
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,300
Even as. The ensemble, the system is probably

32
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,440
probabilistically sampling all of these states,

33
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,190
there is stable, large scale or long term

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,430
equilibrium behavior.

35
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,560
Which.

36
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,240
In that equilibrium state, which is what we're

37
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,340
considering in this model, is sophistical

38
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,410
ensembles are characterized by conservative

39
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,130
qualities.

40
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,130
The example we are looking at first is known as

41
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:14,270
the micro canonical ensemble, where these concerns

42
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,110
quantity is.

43
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:26,670
Our. The energy. And the heard No. We're

44
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,620
conservation of energy, given the name, the first

45
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,470
law of thermodynamics in an isolated system. So

46
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,110
this is a picture that got blown up to its full

47
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,350
page by the printer to serve as a sort of mnemonic

48
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,620
for this microeconomic ensemble

49
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,130
characterised by we have some particles of degrees

50
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,440
of freedom in the system. Your picture is a beaker

51
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,410
with a cap of the show that all the particles are

52
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,190
trapped inside, can't escape, can't change the

53
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,830
number of particles, and there's also some

54
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,880
insulation shaded it around. The outside

55
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,300
of this drawing illustrates the conservation of

56
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,710
energy, a possibility for the system to exchange

57
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,290
the energy with its surroundings, with the other

58
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,060
system. So we're going to pick up from there if

59
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,200
there are no questions about what we saw before.

60
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,150
Some of the qualities that we can now derive from.

61
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,050
Statistical samples of the microeconomics ensemble

62
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,830
in particular

63
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,910
zoom back in focus. Starting with the Entropia,

64
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,850
which is. One of those ideas was.

65
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,690
They may have popped up a lot in popular culture,

66
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,820
everyday life, and is sort of the synonym for

67
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,410
chaos or disorder. Here we get entropy as a

68
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,980
mathematical property of statistical examples

69
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,960
where this initial definition that we wrapped up

70
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,820
with on Tuesday is. A generic definition of

71
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,360
entropy for any physical ensemble, not necessarily

72
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,460
the micro canonical example.

73
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,410
In terms of the probabilities piece of pie that

74
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,910
each of the possible micro stages of the system

75
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,480
has to occur as that system probabilistically,

76
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,110
examples microstates involving over time.

77
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,430
Again, as always, in this course, in thermodynamic

78
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,900
equilibrium.

79
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,990
Now.

80
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:21,210
Well. The reason note here that. Because we're

81
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,550
imposing from an equilibrium, we can expect the

82
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,940
entropy to be a simple function of the

83
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,640
conservative qualities so specialized to the micro

84
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,420
canonical example is entropy, although it's

85
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,900
expressed in sort of a not intuitive way in terms

86
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,100
of because the probabilities should in some way be

87
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,520
related to that sort conserve energy and particle

88
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,520
number, which we can start to derive by plugging

89
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,740
in the expression for this piece of by. In the

90
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,910
Michael Canonical ensemble, in some of the key

91
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,000
political, does anyone remember what that

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,020
expression was?

93
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,240
One over, and

94
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,090
that's what it is. There was a hyperlink to the

95
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,870
equation that appears and is the number of

96
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,540
microstates in the system, every single one of

97
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,450
them is equally probable in the micro particle

98
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,260
sample. And hence those equal probabilities are

99
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,110
just one. And so that any of them add up to one

100
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:48,900
hundred percent. So that's the entropy is the

101
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,620
negative of that. So overall, microstates of this

102
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,570
constant probability, whatever, and. I'm so

103
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:02,050
supportive of whatever happened, so OK. None of

104
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,960
that depends on the micro state we're in. This is

105
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,000
just a cost factor that can be pulled outside of

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,570
that situation. So the sum of I was just counting

107
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,860
one from one to add to that is a factor of 10 that

108
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,450
cancels out with the whatever over. And we're left

109
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,340
with a negative log. Whenever any of the

110
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,070
properties of the walk, we know that that is the

111
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:34,990
logarithm of the number of microstates. And if you

112
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,470
were ever to visit Vienna and start wandering

113
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,430
around graveyards there, you would see this

114
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,110
equation with slightly different terminology on

115
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,510
Boltzmann's gravestone. This is Boltzmann's

116
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,880
equation. The entropy is the logarithm, the number

117
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,130
of microstates that was one of his best punchy

118
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,620
contributions to the physical physics and also put

119
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,780
it on his gravestone when he died and. So as the

120
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,280
number of accessible microstates goes, this

121
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:18,710
entropia grows and eventually diverges. And this

122
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,780
is. Maybe a more intuitive way to connect the

123
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,910
mathematical definition of entropy that we have to

124
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,050
sort of every day terminology of entropy as a

125
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,670
measure of disorder, the more microstates there

126
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,270
are with a fixed energy particle numbers and the

127
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,060
more possibilities there are of arranging the

128
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,880
degrees of freedom, the larger the entropy, which

129
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,500
we can see corresponds what we will see. Some of

130
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,130
these examples coming up, how that corresponds to

131
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,980
less ordered, less special and more generic

132
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,510
microstates for our system. Now, of course, we

133
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,640
said at the top of the page, you would expect

134
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,740
entropy to depend on the conserve energy particle.

135
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,750
No, it's not obvious how those appear in the

136
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:17,720
microstates. It turns out to be they do all of the

137
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,820
conservative quantities and the number of

138
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,880
microstates are interrelated. So we have to

139
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,570
specify the system and its details in order to

140
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,390
come up with what precisely those interrelations

141
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:41,560
are. So. One quick example is. If we have a spin

142
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,330
system introduced earlier this week. Each of which

143
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,670
can point either up or down, and it is in a

144
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,630
magnetic field to define its energy, all of that

145
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:57,220
magnetic field is turned off. We want to find the

146
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:04,000
entropy that's avoiding them. So here we just need

147
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,870
to count the total number of microstates, for

148
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,460
instance, which.

149
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,260
Something we did on Tuesday is remember that

150
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,730
results. Right down here.

151
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,350
So, yeah, two to the power in.

152
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,630
The total number of microstates for and spins the

153
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:41,400
conflict to the values and as a blog we have been

154
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,160
involved to for the Intrepid, still a mystery you

155
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,010
that grows linearly with the number of spins that

156
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:57,300
field is off. We can also so when there is no

157
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,620
magnetic field, all of those could be and spin

158
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,220
states have that same energy equals zero. We can

159
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,930
also ask if we have a non through a magnetic field,

160
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,220
but still require the same fixed energy in the

161
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,590
micro canonical ensemble.

162
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:25,170
What is the entropy in that case? So it's the same

163
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,600
procedure figuring out. How many microstates there

164
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:30,960
are?

165
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,950
You know, the.

166
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,580
This is also something that.

167
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,610
You may have seen it a saw the same calculation in

168
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,700
a different context. So maybe I will just. Mind

169
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,020
you, that the silk, the way to get energy is zero

170
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,200
when the magnetic field is non-zero is to have an

171
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,990
equal number of students line with the magnetic

172
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,360
field compared to those aligned against it. So

173
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,890
half of the spins have to be and plus, along with

174
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,350
many other people, contributing a negative energy

175
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,090
to the total. And therefore, if we have capital

176
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,960
and spins and we want to choose the case and plus

177
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,270
of them to be oriented up there are. The binomial

178
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:30,210
coefficient in use and plus ways of doing that in

179
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,620
those different ways of arranging the spins to

180
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,500
have zero errors used, the microstates that this

181
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,130
microeconomic system would have, which if we know.

182
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,340
Since we know that. Total number of spins is now

183
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,720
twice and plus we can. Rearrange this binomial

184
00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:00,600
factor as to add plus factorial over. And plus

185
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,710
Vectorial, and then the Vectorial, the two and

186
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:09,010
plus minus and plus, which is just ten plus for a

187
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,160
second factor. Plus, Vectorial, the denominator.

188
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,210
Which the Lord breaks up into.

189
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:27,840
One of the numerator minus, take that count to

190
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,790
twice the Lord.

191
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,760
Of the Vectorial in the denominator. So it's

192
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,190
obvious to see. From this expression, if this

193
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:49,950
entropy is more or less than. The case where there

194
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,010
was no magnetic field at all to the end, states

195
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,490
were contributing, what were they to the entropy,

196
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,350
if we consider this the simple case of an equals

197
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,300
eight? Then.

198
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,980
We have. Two of the power eight.

199
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:18,240
This is two hundred fifty six, so it is zero and

200
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,410
all possible microstates are at play, the entropy

201
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,140
is that more to our eight to fifty six.

202
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,800
H.S, non-zero.

203
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,800
It's easier to look at this fraction with the

204
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:43,440
entropy is. The board of two influxes cattle,

205
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:49,470
which is bait and expand that vectorial and cancel

206
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,400
out the full effect within hours of Vectorial the

207
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,260
denominator, I'm left with just the other power

208
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,030
for Vectorial, the denominator four times to the

209
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,730
state and six of the three is to seven times, five

210
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,340
is thirty five and two times thirty five is of 70.

211
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,040
So the total number of microstates has gone down

212
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,800
by. Probably a factor of for. And the entropy has

213
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,840
changed here by.

214
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,960
Of course, on the border, which you will see a bit

215
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,430
later on, is.

216
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,480
I has some interesting behavior because it limits.

217
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,080
That was on the screen while I was writing it. So

218
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,980
we will. Revisit some calculations, and that's

219
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:48,070
where possibly a tutorial, possibly next week. For

220
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,550
now, just based on this definition that we have,

221
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,700
we can build up some more.

222
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:02,030
Details or characteristics of the. And one of the

223
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:09,130
main features of the Entropia of a period way to

224
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:16,160
categorize observables is how the entropy behaves

225
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,880
as the system becomes larger or equivalently, we

226
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,300
take two copies of the same system and imagine

227
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,640
considering them as a combined system with some

228
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,530
subsystems. So we saw the general growing that

229
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,390
with the number of microstates logarithmically.

230
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,170
And.

231
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:49,760
Mr. Consider. This in a more general context than

232
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,190
a specific number of things. We can picture these

233
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:59,380
two school systems, each put in its own box to

234
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,440
emphasize that it is a micro canonical system not

235
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,910
allowed to exchange other particles or energy with

236
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,820
anything else in the universe.

237
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,320
So that the energy and the number of these two

238
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:19,090
systems is characterizing them and also.

239
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,910
Assume that there is a. How's the magnetic field

240
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,790
to get to produce this energy that is the same for

241
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,280
both of these isolated systems when it comes to.

242
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,250
And then the energy has the same form and then

243
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:46,110
just the number of spins in each system align with

244
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,890
or against that magnetic field.

245
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,150
And. Just for the sake of using different

246
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,640
variables for these two different systems, we'll

247
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,460
say that the probability probabilities in System

248
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:02,790
one.

249
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,670
I have that same piece of mind for each of their

250
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,840
lawmakers that I microstates. And there are in one.

251
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,710
Of those microstates, and we'll call the

252
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:25,010
probability system to Kucik, ranging from from one

253
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,290
over the total number of microstates in that

254
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:33,200
system. And if we look at these two systems as a

255
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,580
single entity with two subsystems that are still

256
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,420
isolated from each other and still in the same

257
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,450
magnetic field with the same energy in order to

258
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,500
determine the energy of this. Combined system.

259
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,600
Make the subsequent one plus two. Always do is

260
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,010
figure out the number of microstates. And someone

261
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,130
else to in terms. Of the number of individual

262
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,790
microstates and one and then to 12.

263
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,660
This is. Reasonably straightforward, because

264
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:23,020
whatever the system one is in some microstates by

265
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,070
the system, two is completely independent of it

266
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,410
and can sum over all.

267
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,210
And two of its microstates and then the overall

268
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,160
sum over all.

269
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:45,830
I microstates and one brings in the power factor

270
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,800
of them two for each and one each want to be a one

271
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,760
microstates, which says the words that the total

272
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,860
number of microstates is the product of the

273
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,740
microstates in both systems. So it was that quick

274
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,290
argument is clear.

275
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,670
I don't see any objections to it.

276
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,240
And.

277
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:27,900
We also.

278
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,430
Are not supposing here that the analysis I'm doing

279
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:40,420
here is actually not assuming that statistical

280
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,930
equilibrium, it can be applied more generally than

281
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:47,020
that if we go back to that initial definition of

282
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,110
energy, sorry, the initial definition of entropy

283
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,240
in terms of probabilities.

284
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,160
The entropy was the sum.

285
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,960
Over all the probabilities of this combined system.

286
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,670
The U.K. and Borg.

287
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,410
So we need to figure out as a prelude to this

288
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:23,760
calculation what exactly the combined entropies.

289
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:29,880
The combined probabilities are, since we're

290
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,670
keeping these two subsystems completely

291
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,520
independence, the probability of that system, one

292
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:43,420
has stayed on, I guess. Subsystem, too, has states

293
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,190
how big is the pay is just the product of the

294
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,630
individual probabilities.

295
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,370
Which we can check quickly, is well defined

296
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,220
because, again, at that independence between these

297
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:03,930
two subsystems. If we saw over. The product of

298
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,570
those states at one time, there were two in this

299
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,770
combined system. That's just the product over each

300
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:14,970
system independently and sends the probabilities

301
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,010
of System one don't depend on the states and

302
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:22,200
system to break up the system into separate sums

303
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,590
for each subsystem. Overall state of the

304
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,940
probabilities, which we know by the definition of

305
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,580
probability, is just. One in each case. Which is

306
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,180
to say.

307
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,600
Matt.

308
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,710
Well defined by the probability piece of junk that

309
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:55,330
adds up to one overall of the data and one, two,

310
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,700
microstates of this microeconomic system, and we

311
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,050
can do that same procedure. Breaking up this song.

312
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,920
Over, I think, those two subsystems into.

313
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,960
Two independent studies and at the same time did

314
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:24,870
break up this. Logarithm of the products we know

315
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:31,650
is the sum of logarithms, so we can have.

316
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:39,690
The. First term, it is P times, Q Times, the one

317
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:42,120
with rearrange that.

318
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:52,130
Like still calling the. Probabilities survive from

319
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,270
such as the one outside of the some of the

320
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:58,300
microstates and subsystem to. And similarly.

321
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,250
The case when we have the second term.

322
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,280
So hopefully that was not too quick just now,

323
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,240
broken up these sums into separate sums or for

324
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,940
each independent subsystem in the same way as

325
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,770
before, and this allows us to spot the same simple

326
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,680
probabilities that add up to one of those two

327
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,510
cases. Whereas we saw that the. Somewhere over

328
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:46,640
microstates of Pewaukee inequitably culotte to.

329
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:53,630
Was just the. Individual entropy from system one.

330
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,200
That first term, plus the individual, that system

331
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:04,020
to. So we've derived from the basic definition,

332
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,150
the result of the entropies, when we add up to

333
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,650
independent subsystems, just add together to form

334
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,810
the entropy of that combined subsystem of the

335
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,700
combined overall system when the two such systems

336
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:26,550
are independent. This is the definition of an

337
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,640
extensive quantity. The energy and the number of

338
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,570
particles are the easier examples to use to work

339
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,500
with. If we take two systems with two particle

340
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,070
numbers and one then to add together, a particle

341
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,260
is just the sun. The entropy behaves the same way,

342
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:54,130
which was not guaranteed optimal result from. This

343
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,650
calculation, based on the definition and could be

344
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,050
contrasted to what are called intensive quantitate

345
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,320
is

346
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,770
an example of which is the temperature of two

347
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,370
systems, two systems with the same temperature,

348
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,950
and look at them as a combined system of two

349
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,110
subsystems. I don't expect the temperature to

350
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,230
double. I expect to see the same independent of

351
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:23,150
the size of the overall system. And then, of

352
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,430
course, there are quantities that are neither

353
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,710
extensive nor intensive. For example, the total

354
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,910
number of microstates which turned out to be the

355
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:35,740
product of the microstates, the two independent

356
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,730
systems is not constant, nor does it grow

357
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,320
addictively the way that the entropy does.

358
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,770
And of course, everything becomes simpler if we

359
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,680
were to assume for a dynamic equilibrium. We would

360
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:57,940
have the Entropia system just given by the one of

361
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:03,580
its microstates, and in that case, the

362
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,920
probabilities for the combined system as before,

363
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,190
add up to whatever the total number of microstates

364
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,430
each that there's some over and what time them to

365
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,150
give 100 percent. And then the calculation would

366
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,140
it be called. Even easier, the combined entropy

367
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,140
and just by the properties of the water, the World

368
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,830
Cup into the some of the original to entropies.

369
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,260
So that extensive property is one feature of

370
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,360
entropy, but maybe not the most interesting one,

371
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,170
or at least not interesting enough to describe it

372
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,620
as a law of nature. What happens?

373
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,490
Or what we can generalize that same set of two is

374
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,540
now in addition to taking those two subsystems and

375
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,680
bringing them together in a combined system, we

376
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,050
will allow them to exchange energy particle number

377
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,330
with each other. So we'll call that through

378
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:19,920
contact. Where we have those same to. Subsystems

379
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,420
in the magnetic field that are now brought into

380
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,570
thermal contact that have the possibility of

381
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,430
exchanging energy. With each other now, the

382
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:37,040
overall system, the total energy one plus the two

383
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,510
and one plus into. Is still being treated,

384
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,870
microeconomic energy is concerned for that total

385
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:52,020
one plus two and similarly for political No. But

386
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:56,250
the individual interviews, you want to get

387
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,550
themselves change basically by swapping energy

388
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,980
between themselves, so a bit of energy can be

389
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:07,520
given up by subsystem one. Shifted over to some

390
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,450
system, too, so those individual energies are no

391
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:15,230
longer conserved and the individual subsystems are

392
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,230
no longer psychoanalytical for that reason. But

393
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:23,920
economical ensemble requires that cost of energy

394
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:30,290
and. So if we call this overall system. It's the

395
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:35,330
capital Omega, with no further subscripts, we can

396
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:39,320
tell immediately that it is not the same as.

397
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,820
That's system one plus two. We were talking about

398
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,660
it in the context of extensibility subsystems work

399
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,850
at independent each individually microeconomic

400
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:56,010
level and the entropy just on attributes of those

401
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,860
independent subsystems, typically at.

402
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:05,970
In order to. Appreciate that this. New combined

403
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:10,520
system of mega is not the same as the collection

404
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,550
of those two independent subsystems. We just need

405
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:19,350
to count the total number of microstates. And see

406
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,930
that it is not the same as simply being a product

407
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:28,030
of. The one time that two of those two original

408
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,750
systems.

409
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:38,260
And in this calculation, we do have a important

410
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:44,430
remaining tool, which I actually paid. The set up,

411
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,790
which is that conservation of the poor energy, so

412
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:51,540
we know that any microstates of this combined

413
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:56,710
system will make. Has to have a total energy.

414
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:02,050
We're capital so that in one of these two

415
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,910
subsystems that are now account contact

416
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:07,930
contributes some lower case energy, each one to

417
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,130
that total. The other subsystem has to contribute

418
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,180
the remainder capital, the minus lowercase E one.

419
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,330
Now, if we fix those two values in every case, in

420
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:26,100
one, then the remainder will be minus one. We then

421
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,950
have the combination of two independent

422
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:32,490
microeconomic ensembles that we computed to have

423
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,480
the total number of states simply a product of the

424
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,610
corresponding microstates with those values and

425
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:45,070
energy in each of the independent subsystems. So

426
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:50,230
this is. That said, repeating the same calculation

427
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,780
we did earlier with the independent subsystems,

428
00:32:53,290 --> 00:33:01,160
but now. The key is that there are at least one in

429
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:05,270
many more ways of distributing this total energy

430
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,360
among these two systems. We know that it's

431
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,330
possible to have the case we considered before

432
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:17,150
that case even equal to the capital E. one. We

433
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:20,540
started off with that is when it started off with

434
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:25,560
know that subsystem can take that energy capital

435
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:31,100
if you want, it already did. So from that

436
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,600
particular case, we already have all of the

437
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,410
microstates. And if someone wants to. That we

438
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:43,650
considered earlier on, we had the system of two

439
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:47,350
independent subsystems considered in combination.

440
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:54,240
But in addition. We have to keep track of these

441
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:58,100
situations in which system?

442
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,050
Omega one has energy other than one. So the total

443
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,900
number of microstates for that system Omega.

444
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,460
Starts off with the product and one time step two

445
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:19,350
and we had for. From those decisions to subsystems,

446
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,110
we started off with having their initial values of

447
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:25,140
energy and then in addition to that, there's a sum

448
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,150
over all the other possible values of energy that

449
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:33,570
we were all the possible ways that the systems

450
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,540
could break up the conservative energy amongst

451
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,320
themselves. And this stuff is just counting a

452
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,720
number of states that are all one negative numbers.

453
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:48,000
So we know that the sun is also not negative. So

454
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,300
the total number of member states is at least as

455
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:57,000
large as the. And one times and two that led to

456
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,080
the extensive interview on. And this economy holds

457
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,730
only when there is no other possibility than

458
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:10,520
having the

459
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,240
energy and system will be its initial value, which

460
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,000
is to say that the two subsystems individually

461
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,450
made MicroCon behave in the same way as it could

462
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:28,210
have exchanged energy in the first place. So in

463
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,350
full generality, without even specifying the

464
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,380
details of these systems, you can say that the

465
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,110
energy. Of these two systems, nothing but the

466
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,780
entropy of the two systems that have got into

467
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,710
trouble, contact is at least as large and

468
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,460
generally larger than those two subsystems when

469
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,280
they were independent and isolated from each other,

470
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,440
which you might recognize as the second law of

471
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,220
thermodynamics. The statement being that when

472
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,190
initially isolated subsystems are brought into

473
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:10,510
thermal contact, the entropy can never decrease

474
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:16,330
and generally almost always increases, except in

475
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:20,500
some extremely special cases when that thermal

476
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,260
contact actually has no effect. Even though the

477
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,870
systems are able to exchange energy,

478
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,190
their details prevent them from doing so in order

479
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,820
to satisfy the first law of thermodynamics.

480
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,560
So the second law of thermodynamics, which is.

481
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:47,880
Again, another question related to entropy that I

482
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,350
imagine you've seen in less mathematical contexts,

483
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,410
it is it's possible to do more general derivations

484
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,220
than taking to systems, bringing them together in

485
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,990
terms of content and allowing them to exchange

486
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,800
energy if we picture that process going on in time.

487
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,510
This has the implication that the entropy never

488
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:14,130
decreases the increases as time passes under any

489
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,150
circumstances.

490
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:23,910
Which we can actually make use of. To the. Find

491
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:28,530
more generally what we mean by dynamic equilibrium

492
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,890
as compared to a statement about probabilities and

493
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:38,500
the souls equation. Here it is. That the

494
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,260
probability of each micro state of the macro

495
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,340
economic one is equal to the inverse of the total

496
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:52,540
number of microstates. But because entropy. Is a

497
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:56,040
non decreasing quantity under any circumstances.

498
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,620
If we consider its time evolution that.

499
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,480
That not decreasing property is going to call for

500
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:12,610
any statistical microeconomic or not including the

501
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:16,820
one that. Including ones that we will get to in

502
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,250
coming weeks. So the entropy.

503
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:27,120
Is. Always decreasing, is that a function of

504
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,790
whatever qualities are considered for this

505
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,780
ensemble and.

506
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:37,190
We want people to be able to be the state where

507
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:40,700
these qualities have some stable value. They have

508
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,630
to depend on the on the conservative qualities. So

509
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:49,280
we define thermodynamic equilibrium to be the

510
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,860
situation in which the entropy of the ensemble is

511
00:38:54,860 --> 00:39:00,200
maximized. So we have some we can have some

512
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:06,660
generic picture or intuition of. Doing something

513
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:10,890
to systems that bring together a lot of energy, as

514
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,390
we just consider this, can leave them out of

515
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,970
trouble and hard to analyze with the.

516
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,000
Tools and techniques for developing this course,

517
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:27,590
but as time passes, we expect them to approach and

518
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,630
recover their equilibrium in this new situation.

519
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,980
Two systems that are now allowed to exchange

520
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:38,240
energy. And as the system goes through that

521
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:44,020
equilibration process, the entropy is. Never

522
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,140
decreasing, it is either constant or increasing.

523
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:51,880
And once some of the people that it's reached, the

524
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,380
entropy that saturated whatever down it is allowed

525
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,100
to to reach with a finite number of microstates,

526
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,900
which physical systems you always have. So then

527
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,880
the saturation of that maximum entropy corresponds

528
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,850
to the phenomenon of an equilibrium without having

529
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:16,990
to specify precisely what quantities are conserved,

530
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,490
precisely what sophistical ensemble are

531
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:25,870
considering. So that was sort of a long process of

532
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,570
argumentation based on physical intuition rather

533
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:33,460
than mathematics. Are there any objections to that?

534
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:47,430
Not hearing any what we can do just to wrap up

535
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:51,700
this section and possibly report. Today will see

536
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,410
is show that this new and more general definition

537
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:03,450
of equilibrium reproduces. And the. Condition we

538
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,000
had earlier in that equation, my team with a

539
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,640
microcephalic ensemble where all of the

540
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,860
probabilities for all the microstates are equal to

541
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:17,520
that equilibrium. So the way we do this is

542
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,240
consider that entropy and its generic form, then

543
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:27,490
some over microstates of plock. And then subject

544
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:32,600
to this maximization process, to the three

545
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,450
constraints implicit in the Bible canonical

546
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,550
example, first, that the probabilities are

547
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,990
probabilities and add up to one with some degree

548
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:45,650
of microstates, and also that we conserve energy

549
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,740
and conserve part of the number. And it turns out

550
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:54,210
that it's only the final constraint over. The

551
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:56,490
probability of something up to 100 percent that

552
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,680
needs to be taken into account in this

553
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,370
maximisation through. A method of war crimes

554
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:07,510
multipliers, which. Pretty sure you should have

555
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:10,660
seen in previous novels, or perhaps not recently,

556
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,440
perhaps some time ago, so might be worth reviewing

557
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:21,160
at least briefly. But the idea is that. In order

558
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:26,680
to maximize the entropy is subject to some

559
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,010
constraints in this case, the sum of some of the

560
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:33,430
probabilities equals to one. We define a modified

561
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:38,650
function in this bar that depends on everything.

562
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,740
That depends on as well as this additional

563
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:46,180
parameter lambda code. That multiplier and what

564
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:50,410
this multiplier is multiplying is the quantity

565
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:57,340
that implements this constraint when the sum over

566
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:01,090
P equals to one, its quantity in parentheses

567
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:06,220
vanishes. So that whenever we have found. And

568
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:11,430
whenever we oppose. This condition on the

569
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:17,100
probabilities we automatically get back, recover

570
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:21,610
equality between this modified spark and the

571
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:24,870
emotional bond that we are interested in and in

572
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:25,530
particular.

573
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,090
If we consider the derivative of this modified

574
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:36,690
entropy with respect to the large multiplier, once

575
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,360
we impose the constraints that also banishes.

576
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:45,290
Which means that in the extreme of the modified

577
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,740
entropy, it's going to remain an extreme one of

578
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:53,880
the. Actual entropy that we are interested in the

579
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,470
case when land is equal to zero. So.

580
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:04,530
With that set up, the.

581
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,780
The maximization process simply consists of

582
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:17,180
looking at the derivative of that is modifying the

583
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:24,380
image on the screen some way with respect to the

584
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:29,560
probability that we want to. Two constraints. We

585
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,390
want to find the value for the probability of a

586
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:39,000
generic MicroTech that maximizes the entropy with

587
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,550
this multiplier, imposing the condition that the

588
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:47,400
probability. Is well defined as up to one hundred

589
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,790
percent of the microstates. So if I copy this down

590
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:57,700
at the moment, then I can get rid of that sheet.

591
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:58,490
We have a similar.

592
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:07,440
Piece of I have one piece of it. Plus, Linda, I

593
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:11,510
just remember I used to buy that old stone like

594
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,170
this one,

595
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,510
and now we can.

596
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,820
Just to pose the

597
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:30,770
identity written up here, where a derivative of

598
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:35,560
probably a piece of eye with respect to. The

599
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,020
probability piece of cake is going to vanish

600
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,170
overnight, it's not equal and it will be one

601
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:45,530
whatever equals K, that's the Honaker Delta

602
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:49,390
function that we encountered briefly last week.

603
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,160
And we can pull it through in this. Some of the

604
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,040
derivative will pick out the Kathee term in that

605
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:57,910
sum over I.

606
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:05,370
And give that Delta function so. Acting first on

607
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,880
the piece of up front, because the building like

608
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,490
so negative Morgan piece of.

609
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,090
Similarly, acting on the board with derivative

610
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:22,560
keeps that piece of iron and brings over a. One

611
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:24,500
over piece of the building,

612
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,980
that is. Pick over pick, which is one, which is

613
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:37,990
one. And then. The final term is even simpler,

614
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:42,590
which is pick out the delta, I came from the

615
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:46,490
derivative of peace, the value of peace, OK? Which

616
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:50,240
is going to be one for the one term that some of

617
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:54,170
that is equal to the probability, T.J., we are

618
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:59,130
interested in. So overall, we have. Negative all

619
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:03,390
play minus one slam dunk, that being so equal to

620
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:07,410
zero to get the extreme. Of this modified and

621
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:13,110
which is to say that this piece of. Is the

622
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:20,400
exponential of India minus one, which with this

623
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,600
constant parameter lambda is just a constant and

624
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,450
that imposing. The constraint that we have, the

625
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:32,560
some over all of these equals, one immediately

626
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,900
tells us that this is one over the total number of

627
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:43,120
microstates. So we have. We we have derived what

628
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:47,510
initially we had to state as a definition of

629
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:49,970
thermodynamic equilibrium to maximize the entropy.

630
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:53,600
We find that all of the probabilities for the

631
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,770
microstates and the macroeconomic ensemble. Are

632
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,400
our people so equal probability for every micro

633
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:09,390
state in this microcosm ensemble? So given the

634
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:13,290
time, that's where we will wrap up, so I thought

635
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,840
we might get the temperature today, but we will do

636
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,070
that on Monday instead

637
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:24,590
of the fact that temperature is not. Inherent in

638
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:27,620
the micro example, but it provides on the same

639
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:33,740
footing as with some high tech companies in an

640
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,180
unusual counterintuitive futures. This afternoon

641
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:43,970
we have a tutorial. So my plan is to go through

642
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:46,100
the remainder of that computer and then I'll

643
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,720
answer any questions that have come up about the

644
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:51,510
computer project that's due next Thursday. And if

645
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:54,620
that doesn't tell the time, I have more computing

646
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,760
stuff that we can look at

647
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,770
all of those. So see you then.

648
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:14,270
You focus on what is really focused on this be. So

649
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:18,590
my office would to walk back there right now if

650
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:21,260
you can come along with

651
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:24,290
a book or just for.
