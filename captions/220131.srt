1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,780
With that, I should be able to switch back to the

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:12,860
doc cam---just on the stroke of four!  Well, welcome

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,910
to Statistical Physics.  I guess the bells are

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,540
our cue to get started. I am David Schaich and will

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,380
be your host for this module. And the name is

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,980
pronounced like in handshake. It's

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,730
easier to say that it is the spell. I think when I

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,270
was testing this doc cam itself over the weekend,

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,000
it was also not responding to zoom in or out, but just

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,470
get set up with some of the things I'll be going

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,880
through today, and in particular, I should

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,050
probably put a microphone in case I want anything

13
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,510
I'm saying to be picked up by any of these

14
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,370
recordings. I'm trying to make several.

15
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:04,600
The various logistical things to go through today,

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,030
some of which you might have seen earlier in other

17
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:12,460
modules, one of those is the attendance and

18
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,190
well-being monitoring system that the department

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,600
is. So I've got a six digit number for you all to

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,280
plug into that system. You want to record it. And

21
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,740
we're engaged with this stuff. That's very, very I

22
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:41,020
hate to leave that up on the top there as we go

23
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,590
forward.

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,670
And at least part of today will be spent on.

25
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,380
Logistics and other important things, but I want

26
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,200
to say, first of all, I should. Introduced myself

27
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,580
in a bit more detail in a lecture here in

28
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,190
theoretical physics, mathematical sciences. I've

29
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,120
been here for three years now and this is the

30
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,700
third time I've taught this module in a different

31
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,300
way after the excitement of the past few years.

32
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,270
And it is at this point a sufficiently small

33
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,290
module that I think I can introduce myself and ask

34
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,350
you to introduce yourselves and try to attach

35
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,360
names to faces Musubi masks. So if you're all

36
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,070
right with that, would you start by the left side

37
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,460
here and possibly introduce yourself to each other?

38
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,850
How many logical you could get together at the

39
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,560
past? If you want to see your name, that's all it

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,160
has to be.

41
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,200
George, George.

42
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,670
Right, right, John. Well, try to remember those

43
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,880
that, like you said at.

44
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,560
I'm just debating what to talk about first, maybe

45
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,500
the best thing to do would be to talk about why

46
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,920
we're doing what we're doing before going into

47
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,400
battle and then what? So I want to introduce and

48
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,910
motivate statistical physics as really one of the

49
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,720
pillars of physics over the past couple of

50
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,150
centuries that I'm sure for the next couple of

51
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,630
centuries coming up after that, which goes along

52
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,950
with relativity and quantum mechanics as.

53
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,670
Really, the the essence of what physics amounts to

54
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,430
in practice in these days and also

55
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,030
playing an important role in all sorts of

56
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,170
applications from the realm of nuclear physics,

57
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,890
particle physics, cosmology, to figuring squishier

58
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,230
stuff like climate physics and biological physics,

59
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,760
and compared to quantum mechanics and relativity,

60
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,810
which we usually consider in the context of

61
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,070
individual objects or simple systems, just

62
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,710
physical physics really has the unique feature.

63
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,270
That is what happens when phenomena emerge from

64
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,270
collections of large numbers of degrees of freedom

65
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,050
like atoms. So in a gram of water, the sort of

66
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,350
large number have in mind here is roughly 10 to

67
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,340
the power of 22 atoms in a couple of dozen drops

68
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:54,010
of water. And what that enables, in contrast to

69
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,860
some of the simpler and more fundamental things I

70
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,110
imagine you've already seen, is really the

71
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,190
emergence of waiting for the arrow of time, which

72
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,910
is not quite in theory. No, there. But we know

73
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,570
that in this series of pictures, we're putting a

74
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,610
drop of purple dye into a cup of water and seeing

75
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,500
how it expands outward as time goes on until it is

76
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,290
uniformly distributed throughout that water. And

77
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,080
if we think about this for a sec, we. Realised

78
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,730
from the classical or quantum mechanics of atoms

79
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,680
bouncing off each other in the dye, in the water.

80
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,150
We believe in atoms, all those processes look the

81
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,230
same no matter whether time is going forward or in

82
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,060
reverse. If you have two atoms or billiard balls

83
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,700
that come in and out of each other, we reverse

84
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,970
time. They come in off each other in the opposite

85
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,090
direction. But in this physical process coming

86
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,610
from the last number of degrees of freedom,

87
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,970
there's a clear direction to how things are

88
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,680
evolving. We are used to seeing things like milk

89
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,810
and coffee spreading out, and even though the

90
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,900
individual processes at play in that spreading out

91
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,810
are all reversible. It would be very surprising if

92
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,630
we were to see this process going in the opposite

93
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,360
direction, starting from a uniform mixture of

94
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,700
water dye and seeing all the dye.

95
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,510
Collect himself in a small region in that water.

96
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,530
So there is something.

97
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,020
The serious and fundamental to how the universe is

98
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,100
evolving, that is coming from the axis of physics

99
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,560
properties. The properties of statistical physics

100
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,950
that we can keep an eye on as we go through the.

101
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:56,410
This monument and setting that aside, can just

102
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,930
briefly look through the rough outline of this

103
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,040
march divided up into 10 units and 12 weeks. So

104
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,800
we'll be doing. A little less than one minute a

105
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,690
week or a little more than one week a unit, and

106
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,370
there won't be a very hard and rigid schedule. Go

107
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,160
over things in these lectures and tutorials, see

108
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,290
how quickly we go, and we need to speed up or add

109
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,560
more material as the term goes up. Again, this is

110
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,530
the first time I've will actually be able to do

111
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,410
this module in person.

112
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,300
And the basic idea that we are the plane that

113
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,740
we're following, what is essential physics from a

114
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,320
mathematical perspective is based on the idea of

115
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,050
what are called sophistical ensembles, which you

116
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,590
can see popping up a few times throughout this

117
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:55,330
course. And what we'll be doing later today or

118
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,850
later this week is putting in place the

119
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,720
probability fundamentals that define what a.

120
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,430
Statistical ensemble is and then looking for two

121
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,840
or three different examples of those ensembles and

122
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,760
applying them to various systems and in questions

123
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,150
so.

124
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,680
If I were to say things just the sentence, an

125
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,850
ensemble is a statistical system subject to a

126
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,460
certain set of constraints and different

127
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,270
constraints, four to five different ensembles. So

128
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,950
after we look at what we call the microeconomic

129
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,610
ensemble, canonical ensemble, which are subject to

130
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,040
slightly different sets of constraints, we'll get

131
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,450
to all the details in due time to apply that to

132
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,020
the idea of gases and thermodynamic cycles,

133
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,780
followed by what is called a grand canonical

134
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,240
ensemble. Another change in the constraints that

135
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,410
are imposed, which will more then apply to look at

136
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,630
quantum statistics and quantum gases. And all of

137
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,620
those ensembles will be simplified by assuming

138
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,880
that the many particles in these systems are not

139
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,150
interacting with each other. They are just free to

140
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,360
dance around without any care as to what any of

141
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,870
the other particles are doing. Maybe. An example

142
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,620
of that sort of behavior is in the physics of

143
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,410
light photons, which basically pass right through

144
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:31,170
each other as waves wrap up the term by at least

145
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,990
beginning to look at interacting systems where

146
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,940
individual particles are interacting with each

147
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,550
other, bouncing off of each other, which is where

148
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,720
things start to get really interesting and we'll

149
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,230
have a lot of broader applications to fill

150
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,830
whatever time remains once we get to that point.

151
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,610
And I'll try to not get too bogged down in in

152
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,810
these logistics, which I at least find fairly dull,

153
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,930
but we have three class meetings a week and then

154
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:08,540
one tutorial. And for whatever reason, those three

155
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,880
class meetings have to end here. And then on

156
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,550
Tuesday mornings will be next door. And the

157
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,920
tutorial also will be here on Friday afternoons.

158
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,990
There is a canvass site that I think most of you

159
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,970
have visited at this point. I said that link in an

160
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,710
announcement through canvas. And I have office

161
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,980
hours, twice a week following the lecture at this

162
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,620
time on Mondays, as well as the Friday morning

163
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,070
lecture, which will give me a chance if you come

164
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,930
to me with any questions at those office hours. I

165
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,400
have another lecture tutorial meeting immediately

166
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,560
afterwards kicks in. You don't need to be brought

167
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,490
up in half over.

168
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,100
Among the the whole group now what might be more

169
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,810
interesting, but how are you seen on canvas is

170
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,630
some of the assessments that are coming up in the

171
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,820
schedule for that. Where will have just the final

172
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,520
exam of the exam period when it comes to tests and

173
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,200
then all the interim assessment will be

174
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,800
essentially homework, a couple of traditional

175
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,100
homework assignments, some projects, no problems

176
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,800
to work through with the paper, and then a two

177
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,480
part computer project where you will have to write

178
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,200
some computer programs that will look at the

179
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,680
emergence of statistical behavior from a.

180
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,530
Underlying stochastic probabilistic process that

181
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,120
is happening with some level of randomness, but

182
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,580
repeatedly and giving rise to immersions. Have

183
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,890
from that, I don't think there's anything I can do

184
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,060
with those lights to.

185
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,410
Resolution of that can. Sorry about that.

186
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,890
There are various policies about deadlines and

187
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,890
exemptions and deductions that I will set aside

188
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,160
unless there are questions with them, I just say

189
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,570
that for each of these Intermap. Assignments,

190
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,000
we've been given a fixed deadline that's

191
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,730
coordinated within the department, and it's not in

192
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,670
my power to change the assignment itself or be

193
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,370
available to you in at least a week in advance and

194
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,460
hopefully much more than that. The first deadline

195
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,350
is coming up for that first part of the computer

196
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,250
project in a little under three weeks at this

197
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,480
point in mid-February.

198
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,050
So I'm going through.

199
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,790
But I call lecture notes, which is a bit of a

200
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,940
misnomer here, since these are

201
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,860
being updated from some of the asynchronous

202
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,980
materials that. Or developed for promoting of the

203
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,880
jury in the last term. So these are more like a

204
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,790
transcript of what I would say in the full lecture,

205
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,270
and there's not any guarantee that or let me put

206
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,950
it another way. I'm definitely not going to be

207
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,350
just reading off of these lecture notes when we're

208
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,930
meeting in person, which we get a bit tedious.

209
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,190
I will be going through with the material in the

210
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,570
order in style it's presented here and essentially

211
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,880
saying a bit more about things that seem to merit

212
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,010
a bit more discussion, maybe glossing over things

213
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,310
like these logistics that are reasonably well

214
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,640
covered in the lecture notes themselves. And I

215
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,090
know in past. Editions of this molecule, so the

216
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,220
students have been concerned about the appearance

217
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,160
of quantum physics or computer programming in the

218
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,830
outline of the assessment, so it's worth

219
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,050
emphasizing up front that there's no missing

220
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,080
background about any computer programming or

221
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,530
familiar with quantum physics. Everything you need

222
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,260
for that will be covered and in particular for

223
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,840
computer programming, starting at the editorial

224
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,580
this Friday, getting a bit of an introduction to

225
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,910
the programming languages that I personally

226
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,160
recommend for the project work, which is Python

227
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,330
and programming languages go User-Friendly and

228
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,730
very widely used around the world as well as being.

229
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,520
All pre and. It's also something that there are.

230
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,080
Various resources available online where you can

231
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,840
run Python code in case you have any trouble

232
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,200
getting it set up on the basis of your own.

233
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,270
Of which are links there often require creating a

234
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,720
a free account.

235
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,900
I should say that even though I recommend Pythonic

236
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,950
find it easy to work with your choice, if you

237
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,650
prefer to do that, project a different programming

238
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,080
language that you're already familiar with, feel

239
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:06,300
free to do so. Though I would warn against people,

240
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,870
which is not really up to the task that will be

241
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,380
assigned.

242
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,000
And.

243
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,930
You're all in your third year studies at this

244
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,950
point. You are experts in mathematical sciences

245
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,690
studying, but you know how to get the most out of

246
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,460
coming to how to get the most out of the module,

247
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,410
which includes coming to class. Even if everything

248
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,780
feels very easy for you and you're on top of

249
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,180
things, coming to class gives you an opportunity

250
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,850
to dig more deeply into some of the things that

251
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,610
will be oversimplified. Or perhaps glossed over

252
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,520
too quickly. So you're welcome to ask about

253
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,220
extensions or applications. Or anything else that.

254
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,800
Is it any interest to you as we really go through

255
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,060
the material and you'll see in these lecture notes,

256
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,210
there are gaps, there are going to be some

257
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,940
tutorial style exercises? Distributed both on

258
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,390
canvas and in person, and there will also, of

259
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,760
course, be a computer project and homework

260
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,710
assignment that you can work through to really get

261
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,700
a good grasp on the physics and confidence that

262
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,390
you fully understand it well enough to to actually

263
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:29,190
do things with it. So feel free to ask questions

264
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,360
to me, to each other or to any of the additional

265
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,670
books and and resources that are collected

266
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,780
on this last page of the logistics, which will.

267
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,620
Give you more perspectives and. Information about

268
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,870
any particular topic, especially if you are.

269
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,400
Having difficulty understanding any particular

270
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,740
aspect or even understanding why we're talking

271
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,710
about any particular aspect, all of those

272
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,530
questions are welcome and none of them is going to

273
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:07,830
be

274
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:15,840
stupid or otherwise. Problematic. So are there any

275
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,100
questions about the logistics, the health of the

276
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,120
course, the module before you really go into

277
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,670
actual physics and mathematics?

278
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,540
When will the computing project be released? So

279
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,120
the first part that's due in mid-February should

280
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,330
come out in the next few days before a tutorial

281
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,480
this Friday. I want to have it in your hand so you

282
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,150
can connect it up to what we'll be talking about

283
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,120
in terms of computer programming there. In fact, I

284
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,640
wanted to have it in your hand today, but it's

285
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,030
coming up as soon as possible this week.

286
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,780
And you'll see it on canvas and depending on. How

287
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,450
you set your notifications, you might get a

288
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,540
notification there. Just keep an eye out for it.

289
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,420
Other questions

290
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,660
could be it's an individual project, so you're

291
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,290
welcome to talk with each other about it, but

292
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,500
whatever you code up and turn in these to be your

293
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,590
own work, representing your understanding in the

294
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,310
usual way.

295
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,650
The questions and. Feel free to follow up with any

296
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,170
later on, but let's get back to introducing more

297
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:43,670
of this topic to physical fitness over here from

298
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:48,120
time to time. See if any questions. Come up in

299
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,860
the chair, so.

300
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,710
The basic starting point for medical science is

301
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,860
using mathematics to make predictions for

302
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,320
observable phenomena.

303
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,850
In physics in particular, it's this has been a

304
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,760
tremendously successful enterprise and there's.

305
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,780
Even discussions about whether it is a reasonably

306
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,600
successful, which I will not get into. In this

307
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,120
module, though, those of you who are interested in

308
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,870
philosophy are probably already familiar with that

309
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,090
argument, that mathematics is unreasonably

310
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,120
effective in the physical sciences and the various

311
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:41,180
debates around that topic. But in the domain of

312
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,830
statistical physics, what we're really going to

313
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,860
see is. That seems sort of amazingly broad

314
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,010
applications of simple mathematical principles to

315
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,330
all sorts of physical systems and ranging from

316
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,890
subatomic scales to cosmological scales beyond the

317
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,490
galaxy. And.

318
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,410
The temperature is colder than the vacuum of outer

319
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,550
space to really the temperatures of the sort of

320
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,220
heat seeing how statistical physics governs the

321
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,290
spectrum of radiation emitted by the sun. Later as

322
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,430
one application. They are the turban and.

323
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,270
I've already just said at the big picture level

324
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,560
brought up the fact that some physical physics

325
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,890
differs from sort of relativistic quantum

326
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,820
mechanics in terms of producing a clear arrow of

327
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,670
time in the evolution of systems. One other

328
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:48,830
difference that is at the practical level. Is the

329
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:55,950
use of probabilities to. Describe phenomena and

330
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,640
describe things, describe physical processes in

331
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,780
probabilistic terms, the Catholic terms that

332
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:08,610
involve stochastic randomness rather than the in

333
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,370
principle, perfectly predictive behavior of those

334
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,490
other pillars of physics. And even in quantum

335
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,020
physics that are there is.

336
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,230
You might might know or might not it's not

337
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,910
required for this knowledge of others because they

338
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,200
have to have intrinsic uncertainties in quantum

339
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,090
physics. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

340
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,720
places sharp restrictions upon how well you say

341
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,700
the position or momentum of an object can be

342
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,010
something easily known. And there is a

343
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,950
probabilistic aspect to quantum wave functions.

344
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,690
But even in quantum physics, you can in principle,

345
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,440
perfectly predict. Distributions and probabilities,

346
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,360
whereas in sophistical physics.

347
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,650
The approach is characterized by practical

348
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:06,820
limitations on the. The way the extent to which

349
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,700
physical systems can be predicted that are arising

350
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,590
from just the sheer number of degrees of freedom.

351
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,680
Number of independent objects that are involved, I

352
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,400
think, of this number tend to be power. Twenty two

353
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,170
twenty three came up in the big picture. This is

354
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,140
known as Avogadro's number, describing the number

355
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,970
of atoms that are in everyday amounts of substance.

356
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,850
So it's about 18 grams of water. Twenty two liters

357
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,330
of air at sea level. Atmospheric pressure and

358
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:49,260
temperature. Evolve just this enormous amount of

359
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:54,370
information, amount of constituents and. You're

360
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,720
not impressed by the about 10, 20, 30 objects.

361
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,580
Maybe I could ask.

362
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,050
How easy would it be to write down? That's amount

363
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,470
of information in your laptop or even a

364
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,390
supercomputer. So.

365
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,450
If we use some of the math about imagining that

366
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,700
each of these atoms could be described just with a

367
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,090
single bytes of information, which is certainly

368
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:30,940
optimistic once we get up to the level of interior

369
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,810
light that you might have on your hard drive.

370
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:39,110
That's 10 to 12 buttons, so you accounted for one

371
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:45,500
part in 10 to the 10th and the 11th of a 18 grams

372
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,540
worth of water. So that is sort of large numbers

373
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,470
we're talking about in order to write down or

374
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,460
specify positions or velocities of this number of

375
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,670
objects. We need something like one hundred

376
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:06,980
billion terabytes worth of information and we want

377
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,430
to analyze that level of information on a

378
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,940
continuous basis going forward as the systems

379
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,710
evolve in time. So that is what's leading us to

380
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,280
where that's showing the impossibility of

381
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,340
predicting all of those positions and velocities.

382
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,310
The final thing is the ad in full detail, even

383
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:36,710
though in principle it's possible with. One

384
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,620
hundred billion terabytes of data that is updated

385
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,530
continuously in practice, that's not something

386
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:47,960
that we as humans will ever be able to do. So the

387
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,990
alternative that statistical physics is based on

388
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,310
is.

389
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,630
Figuring out what we want to analyze from these

390
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:04,880
large sets of data sets. And coming up with.

391
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,240
Simple mathematical descriptions of those based on.

392
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,280
A. Stochastics, treatment of the underlying

393
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,880
processes is one of those underlying processes are

394
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,530
essentially invisible. And just. As a brief,

395
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,910
historical aside,

396
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,370
approaches, statistical physics approaches were

397
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:36,650
developed in the eighteen hundreds and into the

398
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,280
nineteen hundred as by folks like little Boltzmann,

399
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,890
Willard Gibbs, Albert Einstein, Max Hawk where.

400
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,690
There was a great deal of debate at that time

401
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:54,880
about whether or not the atoms and molecules that

402
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,700
I've claimed are not familiar substances actually

403
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,170
exist, if it was well beyond the capabilities of

404
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,400
19th century technology to see an individual atom

405
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,360
or even an individual molecule. So the proposition,

406
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,870
that stuff we interacted with in measuring

407
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,840
temperature and pressure and intensity of the

408
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,330
large scale macroscopic or thermodynamic

409
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,280
properties of systems, the claim that all that

410
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,680
stuff was really made up of atoms was.

411
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,310
Generally, a fair amount of debate and both men in

412
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:38,750
particular had to spend sort of his entire life in

413
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,250
arguments about whether it was valid or useful to

414
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,020
even hypothesize that atoms existed in this. No.

415
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,830
We should ask, who in this room believes that

416
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,500
atoms are better for the air and the other

417
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,330
substances that were made out of.

418
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,260
One, I'll confess to that. And most hands do seem

419
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,780
to be up here. Willing to accept the atomic

420
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:15,080
hypothesis. But if I were to ask about whether,

421
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,620
you know, who in the room believes that same

422
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,580
fundamental strength is in the live space time

423
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,920
dimensions of what are responsible for those atoms

424
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:28,300
at the most fundamental level. With a show of

425
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:33,050
hands. There are fewer hands, including my own,

426
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,050
you sort of get a sense for the style of debates

427
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,900
that were going on around the development of

428
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,210
statistical physics and really.

429
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:51,490
Crucial advance that allowed Adams to be

430
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,430
conclusively established is something that really

431
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:59,260
existed in in physics and in everyday substances

432
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,910
was the application of sophistical physics to a

433
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,990
process known as Brownian motion, which is where

434
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:15,230
microscopic but still. Visible particles, so you

435
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,860
can the of pollen suspended in water, we observe

436
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,750
it to randomly move around in the early eighteen

437
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:27,860
hundreds and after scientists had done sufficient

438
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,490
experimentation to prove that these objects, these

439
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:35,880
particles and. In this water, we're not, in fact,

440
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,960
alive, and they were just randomly. The debate

441
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,500
became what was causing this range of motion, and

442
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,200
it was Albert Einstein, actually his Ph.D. thesis,

443
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,160
who showed that if you hypothesize the existence

444
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,220
of atoms and molecules and say that these

445
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,220
suspended particles are being moved around by

446
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,790
being knocked against by all the atoms and water

447
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,370
molecules in the water that they're floating in,

448
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,900
you can reproduce that observed random behavior of

449
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:18,460
those microscopic pollen grains. And the. I sense

450
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,580
irritation, part of his miracle here in 1985 was.

451
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,360
A famous application of statistical physics that

452
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,290
sort of finally cracked the debate about the

453
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:36,730
existence of atoms leaving all of us to find them

454
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,950
fairly uncontroversial. How these compare to

455
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:44,710
fundamental strains this in these times and some

456
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:48,490
of the questions that. Folks like Baltimore did

457
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,190
Einstein would encountered back at that time to

458
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,890
deal with high school physics or. Sort of

459
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:58,350
handwaving or physically motivated questions that

460
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:02,940
if we're supposing that all of the observable

461
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,970
behaviors of these systems are caused by atoms and

462
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,780
molecules bouncing into each other, why is it that

463
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,040
we don't see any of that sort of bouncing if we

464
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,130
have a gas in the container? You say that this

465
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,520
pressure is due to. Atoms bouncing off the walls

466
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,190
of the container, exerting force on the wall and

467
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,250
the wall in terms of the force of the atoms by

468
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,520
third law of motion. Why don't we see all sorts of

469
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,040
fluctuations every time a particle is hitting that

470
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,780
wall? Why does it seem very smooth, regular and

471
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:48,020
undisturbed in its behavior? So. There is an

472
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,840
answer to that question at the mathematical level,

473
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,470
rather than the handwaving physics level and the.

474
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,650
Fundamentals to that answer are coming from two

475
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,600
mathematical principles known as the law of large

476
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,990
numbers and the central limit theorem that are

477
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,230
sort of core topics of this first unit.

478
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,580
So. But the questions about that sort of big

479
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,730
picture motivation before I dive into the more.

480
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,370
Detailed mathematics.

481
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,480
So what we're going to do for the remainder of

482
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,800
today is really set up a. Abstracts, well,

483
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,000
foundation for the probabilistic discussions that

484
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,690
will be applied in physics, so it's going to have

485
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,380
a slightly different flavor compared to some of

486
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,470
the later calculations that will be doing in

487
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,160
particular in terms of. How abstract will trying

488
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,590
to keep things, at least at first, just by going

489
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:01,630
through a sequence of definitions of what we're

490
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,120
going to be talking about and why the first of

491
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,410
those being that we're going to consider random

492
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:13,570
experiments by which I mean some some experiments,

493
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:16,600
some observation or manipulation of the physical

494
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,800
world that has an element of randomness to it. So

495
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:26,290
flipping a coin is a simple example of that, where

496
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,080
at least in principle, if we do precisely how much

497
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,710
force I exerted on the coin as I flipped it and

498
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,900
how much resistance encountered to the air as it

499
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,050
rose and fell, we could predict exactly how it

500
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:45,700
would land, where it went. But again, there's too

501
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:51,450
much data to process in all of that to. Predicted

502
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,750
precisely in practice. So believe leave it as a

503
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,180
random process in which the coin can land randomly,

504
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,930
either heads with 50 percent probability or tails

505
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,430
with the other 50 percent. I'm actually getting

506
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,320
ahead of myself a bit.

507
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,990
There's more information in the world after I flip

508
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,860
a coin and just heads or tails and we'll see that

509
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,620
after we do that experiment. So you're flipping a

510
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,030
coin? There is.

511
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:26,210
If Islamic State's Omega for the whole, which

512
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:31,190
includes not only the orientation of that coin, it

513
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,500
says, by the way, but also the fact that it's

514
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,260
bounced off the desk and landed on the floor where

515
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,190
it's sitting, what time everything happened, what

516
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,340
the temperature is in the world around it. And

517
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,510
sort of any other aspect of the physical world

518
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:51,410
that could potentially be impinging on this

519
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,590
process, this random experiment that we are

520
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,190
considering.

521
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,880
And from all of those possible states, all we can

522
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,060
do the usual mathematical things and just collect

523
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:11,590
all the possibilities into a capital or make a set

524
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,070
of all those possible states, all the possible

525
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,410
ways that that coin could have landed in all the

526
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,680
possible locations, including possibilities that.

527
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,720
And I flipped it outside, a seagull could have

528
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,660
swooped in and out of the area, seagulls do. And

529
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:34,260
obviously, we are not interested in all aspects of

530
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,100
that fourth state of the universe. There's just

531
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:43,110
too much information there that is not going to be

532
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:49,120
relevant to. The physics of the observables that.

533
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,670
We actually want to bring the physical physics

534
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,270
methods to bear upon him. So what we. What to do?

535
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:04,290
So if that signal is required, we can just throw

536
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,390
that out as an experiment. The.

537
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,890
What we want to do is really pull out. The

538
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,140
information we actually care about, which in the

539
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,180
context of flipping a coin is I started off with

540
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,590
is whether it lands, heads or tails in each case

541
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,380
with 50 percent probability.

542
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,860
So this is getting rid of things like the

543
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,820
temperature in the location where it landed and

544
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,770
it's also getting rid of perhaps possibilities

545
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,410
that don't match cleanly onto the heads or tails.

546
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,480
Question.

547
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,220
We would typically focus on one flipping a coin.

548
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,520
So if the coin lands on its side, we can just

549
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,940
throw that away through this measurement, throw

550
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,540
away that iteration of the random experiment.

551
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,450
If we consider acting with this measurement, that

552
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:02,810
is.

553
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,430
Producing all of that full information to just the

554
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:11,500
small subset, we care about applying that

555
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:16,040
measurement to the full set of all states, America

556
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:21,430
leaves us with the set of all outcomes instead of

557
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:24,470
the outcome space that we actually care about.

558
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,430
Even though I tried to keep these definitions,

559
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,810
yeah. Maximally abstract at this point. I think

560
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,540
there are some simple examples, including flipping

561
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,580
a coin that we can go through just to make sure

562
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:48,460
everything is is clear. So.

563
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:57,740
This outcome is a can just be a finite set, like

564
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:01,920
flipping a coin and it ends heads or tails. Or it

565
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,790
can be accountably infinite or even continuous to

566
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,400
see examples of all of those later on. But a

567
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,870
simple example is. If we take the six sided die

568
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,680
and we roll it and then we measure the number that

569
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,900
comes out on top, so we throw away all the

570
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,990
information about where the dye ends up, how long

571
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,860
it took to get there.

572
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,750
We do that measurements we end up with. And

573
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,230
outcomes based that I imagine or I hope you should

574
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:38,140
be able to to tell me to write down. So go ahead

575
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,580
and shout it out.

576
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:05,490
That's the one. So it's a set of possible values

577
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,250
we can get from that measurement of what number is

578
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:09,750
on top.

579
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,460
Which could be one, two, three, four or five or

580
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:22,230
six. So that is a danger in any of the given

581
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:25,870
states we could have information about the

582
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,540
position of that. Whether it's orientation,

583
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,830
whether it's.

584
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:39,930
Oriented NASA at some angle to the temperature.

585
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:46,040
The color of the dye, the face of the moon.

586
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:53,190
All aspects of the universe that comes out after

587
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,550
we do that random experiment of rolling to die.

588
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,630
This next example is maybe a little less trivial

589
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,080
because we can see that it's possible to.

590
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:15,140
Defiant experiments that. Or a little more

591
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,930
complicated than simply flipping a coin or willing

592
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:21,620
to die. So in this case, you flip a coin four

593
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:26,000
times. We count that as a single experiment.

594
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,230
That's sort of for.

595
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:35,040
Four coin flips after each of which we measure

596
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:38,790
then whether that coin lands, heads up or tails up.

597
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:44,550
Then doing that measurement. From this single

598
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,650
experiment involving four coin flips is going to

599
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:51,720
give us another outcome space and maybe we can

600
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,160
just go through quickly the possible outcomes in

601
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:00,780
this outcome space. So any example, tell it to me

602
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:05,380
and I'll write it down on the dock in or four

603
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,420
heads.

604
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:18,430
It one on Portillo's is another, and there are.

605
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,620
Other possibilities.

606
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,310
Between.

607
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,890
Which. I would.

608
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,050
To have all of them, but let's put some ellipses

609
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:48,240
there to keep moving on. I guess you can tell the

610
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,480
size of the number of elements in a just by

611
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,130
inspection. Would that be at.

612
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:05,770
Yeah, to the fourth. There are two possibilities

613
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:12,100
for each of the four experiments. Which is 16. And

614
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,970
then. To connect these very trivial experiments

615
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,120
illustrating these abstract definitions, we can

616
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:25,190
start to think about how they apply to some of the.

617
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:30,820
Systems where statistical physics was developed

618
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,210
that tend to be powered, twenty three atoms in

619
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,020
some container.

620
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:45,840
The state of those atom's. Which can include a

621
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,520
whole lot of information, some of which is obvious,

622
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:57,330
like the ten to twenty three positions. Of all

623
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,710
those ads.

624
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,570
Would there normally draw three of them rather

625
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:08,440
than the ten to twenty three of them, and we could

626
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:13,060
also imagine that each of those ordinary items has

627
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,530
some velocity.

628
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,000
Characterizing the state.

629
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,180
Each of them could be a different isotope of argon.

630
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,060
Would be that has a slightly different maps, it

631
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,640
could be a different electronic stage.

632
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,100
Which would affect the. The orientation's that

633
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:48,890
spins.

634
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,630
And that's all information that would be in that

635
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:08,180
full state lawmaker describing this gas in this

636
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,260
container. And if any of my handwriting is

637
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,970
impossible to read up there and hopefully be

638
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:17,180
clearer when I scan these notes and and upload

639
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:22,370
them to canvas after the fact. But given all of

640
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:28,010
these pieces of data, what. What would you be

641
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:30,620
interested in measuring about some gas in some

642
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,900
container that would arise from.

643
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,040
From the behavior of these individual constituents.

644
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,100
Yeah, that's a good one.

645
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:04,040
Putting the thermal in the thermodynamic. Well,

646
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:10,420
it's that one, yeah, that what may well be. Fixed

647
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,050
by the container, if we assume it's a rigid

648
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,170
container, but it's also a large scale process.

649
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,750
And given the volume and the number of atoms.

650
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:26,090
That is related as well to the overall density of

651
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:29,780
atoms in that volume and that density, in fact,

652
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,880
could well have some.

653
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:37,700
Gradients, there might be regions in the volume

654
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:42,140
where atoms were more densely located than

655
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,240
elsewhere. And I think I heard someone say.

656
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,640
Pressure, which is also another of the classic

657
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:56,280
thermodynamic quantities that arises in some way

658
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,550
from the behavior, from the dynamics of these 10

659
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:04,950
of the 20, 30 atoms, and the way it arises is what

660
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:11,160
we will be. We tackle them with statistical

661
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,840
physics, so.

662
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:18,930
With those first set of definitions

663
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,050
taken care of, we can actually generalize the.

664
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:34,920
The concept of measurements to simply considering

665
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:40,110
those measurements to be a label that we can put

666
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:43,320
on each of the states, that big set of mega

667
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,420
characterizes the.

668
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,650
The full information of the world and of the

669
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:56,430
system that we have. So if we take. Each of the

670
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:59,580
possible states is impossible.

671
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,240
Descriptions of the system of the world, I imagine

672
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,880
giving it a unique label, that that uniqueness

673
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,580
means that we can refer to the state as a whole

674
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,480
interchangeably with that label and refer to it

675
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:20,540
just as that label function el. And set aside the

676
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,900
details of what exactly is contained in the state

677
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:28,130
as a whole now with measurements, we're formally

678
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:30,080
doing something different. We're actually throwing

679
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,110
out a lot of the information in the states that we

680
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,870
are not interested in, but precisely because we're

681
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:40,070
not interested in what we're throwing out, we can

682
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:46,040
use this measurement as a label to refer to each

683
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,400
stage just in terms of what we want to measure. So

684
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:53,810
going back to the simple example, if you flip a

685
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:57,830
coin, we can say it just it lands heads or tails.

686
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:00,110
And that's all the information that we need to

687
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:03,380
know, even though there's a lot more in the four

688
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,200
states of America that. We could in principle talk

689
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,460
about. And ignored that relevant information.

690
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:16,280
Basically leaves the outcome space any equivalent

691
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:22,160
to the full set of possible states of the world

692
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:26,600
that America and in fact, in some of the

693
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,770
references in those, for the reasons that they

694
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:34,340
never distinguish between the experimental

695
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,950
outcomes and the measurement outcomes in the first

696
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:40,670
place. But it is a good thing to keep in mind to

697
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:48,310
know that. Information is. Is being removed by the

698
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:51,310
process of measurement and that there is always

699
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,980
more about the world that could be incorporated

700
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,250
into the outcome of that round of experiments, and

701
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,310
we're making the choice of what exactly we're

702
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,190
going to look at when we bring that measurement to

703
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:07,030
bear and talk about outcomes rather than of system

704
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,680
states of the universe.

705
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,140
With an eye on the time, just a couple of minutes

706
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,250
are left, so I will wrap up by.

707
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,470
Emphasizing that we've sort of reached the end of

708
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,570
the formal abstract definitions here

709
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,180
that connect us now from random experiments to

710
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:36,780
probabilities. So. So the last step. From our

711
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,580
outcomes, space to probability spaces is to define

712
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:48,780
an event where that event is any subset of. The

713
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:52,200
outcome space A. So.

714
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:00,340
If we the coin flipping examples a bit too simple

715
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,380
for this, but if we think about that ruling as

716
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:07,510
excited Diagne, an event could be rolling a six or

717
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,610
that event could be rolling anything other than a

718
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:12,850
six. So it doesn't correspond directly to what we

719
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:17,470
would measure, but it does correspond to a subset

720
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,710
of those measurements. A third example, I guess,

721
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:24,280
could be rolling any even number from that guy

722
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,100
that brings in the measurements to four and six.

723
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:36,350
And from all of those events. We can define the

724
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:39,680
event space that we are interested in, we'll call

725
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,450
F, and it is the events in that event space that

726
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:49,100
we will assign probabilities of happening. So for

727
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:53,450
this, the three examples that are here and we know

728
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:57,740
there's a one in six chance of rolling or six if

729
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:02,120
we have a fair die, there's a five six chance of

730
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,090
rolling in other than a six and a 50 percent

731
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:09,710
chance of of rolling an even number. So all of

732
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:16,680
those. All probabilities. Our mapping from that

733
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:22,290
set of all possible events to not negative real

734
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:24,870
numbers between zero percent to one hundred

735
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:30,060
percent, and tomorrow morning we will go through

736
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,820
the properties of probability and start to get

737
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,120
into the wall. First numbers, that central limit

738
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:41,340
theorem applying it. So are there questions about

739
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,920
what we've seen so far today?

740
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:51,160
Do we need to measure it or not, look at it that

741
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,450
way? No.

742
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:57,700
Essentially, the statement of a major function

743
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,210
here just means that the event is being projected

744
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:03,970
to be presented percentage between zero percent to

745
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:07,180
one hundred percent. That's all that needs to come

746
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:07,810
out from that.

747
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:16,460
And if there are questions about the role that

748
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,340
we've seen so far today, it's the first day of

749
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,040
office hours is starting. As soon as I get back to

750
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,700
my office in the theoretical physics will come by

751
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,150
with questions about logistics, background or the

752
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:34,250
explosion itself, in addition to any of the

753
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,970
mathematical content. And with that, I'll

754
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,300
wrap it up for today and look forward to seeing

755
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,920
you tomorrow morning at.
