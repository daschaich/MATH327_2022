1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,910
All right, I think we may as well get under way

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,470
and wrap up the final meeting and recording for

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,770
statistical physics. I'm not surprised that there's a

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,110
small crowd at this point because it's fairly

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,470
obvious that there won't be any new

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,480
content coming this afternoon that will be on

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,550
the exam. We will try to have some fun looking at

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,790
some of the broader applications of

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:36,100
statistical physics, including lattice field theory.

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,760
So this is picking up from the end of the formal

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,450
concept we went through this morning, and even

12
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,930
though it is a tutorial, I think it's fine just to

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,240
chat a bit about these broader applications, not

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,370
doing detailed calculations or anything very

15
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,320
rigorous, but just sort of spotting where the

16
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,490
concepts and tools from statistical physics can

17
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,020
find use. Of course, this is the last scheduled

18
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,130
opportunity for you to ask anything, any burning

19
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,930
questions before we enter the exam period. I

20
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,260
probably won't. Continue holding the schedule

21
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,570
office hours over the next few weeks, but you're

22
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,430
always free to schedule a meeting.

23
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,260
If you need one through the Web interface link

24
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,270
from the. Lecture notes in Canada site before

25
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,330
actually getting into things. You can have.

26
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,970
Actions to up. That through the last six

27
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,090
or nine, seven seven.

28
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,510
In the first of a broader application that.

29
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,260
I have in my interview to talk about is actually

30
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,310
something I mentioned without details earlier in

31
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,750
the week as the domain in which a lot of

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,580
theoretical physics research your little world

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,420
operates through important mathematical

34
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:34,000
calculations applied to quantum field. It is. And

35
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,360
this is what I anticipated and started talking

36
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,930
about in the. The introductory remarks, but

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,990
quantum field theories are several molecules ended

38
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:50,450
up with cells. The basic idea is that. We have

39
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,190
some fields that are defined at every point in

40
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,190
space and time, and they interact with each other

41
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,710
and even with themselves in order to. Produced

42
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,680
essentially all of the behavior that we observe in

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,820
the universe from the strong nuclear force to

44
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,850
investigations here. The report for applications

45
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,820
to the Higgs boson on dark matter and even that

46
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,060
holographic duality that relates these quantum

47
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,740
field theories to particular proposals for quantum

48
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,940
gravity. The.

49
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,990
Fundamental object that governs the behavior of

50
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,930
the particular set of fields and interactions that

51
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,190
arise in any given quantum field theory, is this

52
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:46,290
object here known as the find the path to go after

53
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,840
the Senate declining to introduce it around the

54
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,120
middle of the 20th century? And what this is, is a

55
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,770
big old integral over all of the configurations of

56
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,050
all of these fields at every point in space and

57
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,310
time of the exponential of what's called the

58
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,670
actions of the integral over three dimensional

59
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,050
space and the time dimension of the production of

60
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,250
the system that depends on those fields and

61
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,840
includes the information about how the fields are

62
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,060
interacting with each other.

63
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,120
And then this exponential comes with the argument

64
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,150
that she comes to the pretty factor, the imaginary

65
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,950
union divided by constant and.

66
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,880
Looking at the overall form of this equation. Even

67
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,830
the fact that we call this a Z is a sense that we

68
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,760
should try to interpret it as something like the

69
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,540
partition function of a statistical system that

70
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,290
we've been introduced to in this module dealing

71
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,810
with for several weeks.

72
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,400
The one of the main differences is that both the

73
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,090
passage of the bill and the graduate itself are

74
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,890
functions of the people, so they depend on those

75
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,590
fields, Capital Phi, which in turn are functions

76
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,970
of space and time. And there are also some.

77
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,130
The other key difference in here is the presence

78
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,940
of this factor of turning this exponential into a

79
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:37,150
pure phase. Rather than a real number like the

80
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,380
magician functions.

81
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,940
So the football analogy to that petition function.

82
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,090
This has not been a place of the energy cost of

83
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,390
securing a place of the temperature that we can

84
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,690
interpret as quantum fluctuations that depend on

85
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,980
global timescales to play that role similar to

86
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,170
thermal fluctuations in the canonical ensemble and

87
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,730
to get rid of that. Imaginary factor that gets in

88
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:18,040
the way of this analogy, you can do the trick of

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,010
formulating the theory in an imaginary time. We're

90
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,980
zoom in to see if that helps to focus on the

91
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:32,260
screen, we define this imaginary time tell that is

92
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,280
related to the usual time t by a factor of

93
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,930
plugging that in gives two factors. That squares

94
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,250
make it one. And we have a path integral that

95
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,640
looks essentially the same as a precision function

96
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,510
with observable expectation values. Given, as

97
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,450
always, by the control over all these operations,

98
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,080
but the value of this observable, it depends on

99
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,400
that field configuration weighted by. This also

100
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,030
factor.

101
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,170
So this is the. System that we analyze through

102
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:18,260
multicolor point sampling algorithms. One

103
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,710
limitation to this approach is that working in

104
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,400
imaginary time that is known as overprotection is

105
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,900
only valid in thermal equilibrium. So we are

106
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,990
restricted in this approach from being able to

107
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,170
access any non equilibrium quantities, but as

108
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,390
we've seen in this module, that was itself

109
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,430
entirely equal, that we understood a lot we could

110
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,500
do with that limitation.

111
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,660
The last complication in this formulation of

112
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,200
quantum field theory is that this package itself

113
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,310
is written for all these configurations, formally

114
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,790
becomes an infinite dimensional integral when we.

115
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,240
Imagine those fields to be filled every point in a

116
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,420
continuous space time and infinitesimal shifts

117
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,790
with a new degree of freedom from each of the

118
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:16,060
fields of play, which. Is something that, well, as

119
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,330
you might expect, for a interactive system that

120
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,650
can only be evaluated in very special, very

121
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,610
simplified situations and in general, we need to

122
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,150
regularize this integral, somewhat similarly to

123
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,100
how we regularized the momentum of the ideal gas

124
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,020
particles when we first looked at those in Florida.

125
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,390
And we do that by getting rid of continuous space

126
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,120
of time and actually replacing space and time by

127
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,000
less of the same so that we look for the easy

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,890
model. The conceptual difference here is that.

129
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,100
Because the easy model, we can imagine that

130
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,910
Latisse representing the locations of magnetic

131
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,890
dipoles and molecules that are.

132
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,750
Arranged into a regular grandmother, interactions

133
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,390
with each other. So they are objects that live in

134
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,020
a continuous space of time in this perspective, it

135
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,780
is space and time themselves that are no longer

136
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,910
continuous but only exist at these three points in

137
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:34,230
the regular lattice. So this approach of. With

138
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,770
rotating and then this ties in space and time

139
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,760
defines lattice field theory and the image here

140
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,150
that I'm using to give a feel for what a lattice

141
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,220
looks like is actually taken from a lattice field

142
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,370
through calculation of properties, of protons,

143
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,000
based on the quarks and blue, all that they are

144
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,380
composed of. So. And each of the individual points

145
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,950
in this three dimensional grid that corresponds to

146
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,850
a snapshot of the lattice calculation at

147
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:09,050
particular points in that imaginary time, we have

148
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:15,680
a value for the court field, which carries what is

149
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,950
called a color charge that's somewhat analogous to

150
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,940
electric charge. The difference of a few and one

151
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,450
is one of which being that instead of being just a

152
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,110
single number, electric charge could be one unit

153
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,580
two units, one to one ratio on the colored charge

154
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,570
is a linear combination of red and blue and green,

155
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,250
which is the characteristic feature that led to

156
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,730
this becoming known as color in the first place.

157
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,860
And these linear combinations are shown by the

158
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,390
colors of the individual points of the quark field

159
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,630
in this discrete space. We're the size of the

160
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,320
point indicates the magnitude of the charge that

161
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,840
comes along with its orientation in this

162
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,880
particular space. So that's the sort of games you

163
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,740
play with a quantum field theory, democratized in

164
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,820
a lot of space time

165
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:25,090
and. The key final step for going from numerical

166
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,840
calculations that can employ this finite number of

167
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,390
degrees of freedom on a finite computer to get

168
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,020
back to the quantum field theory that we started

169
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,610
off with and to analyze in getting you a space and

170
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,020
time is to repeat these calculations a few

171
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,320
different times, each time with a larger number of

172
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,080
states, time points that are located closer and

173
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,230
closer to each other, eventually allowing

174
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,500
extrapolation to what's called the continual

175
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,080
limits, where you would have infinitely many

176
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,450
lattice sites close together, reproducing some of

177
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,160
the very continuous space of time. And at that

178
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,760
point that week, rotation to imaginary time can be

179
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,750
undone. We are. Restricted to equilibrium

180
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,720
quantities, and we get back the predictions for

181
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,440
the real world in which we live and in particular

182
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,780
very successful predictions with quantities like

183
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:32,100
the masses and interactions of subatomic particles

184
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,280
being predicted to better than one thousand. And

185
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,810
Premal.

186
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,350
And also broadly applicable not just to. Theories

187
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,160
like the strong nuclear force that govern

188
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,990
subatomic particles, but also to. Systems of dark

189
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,540
matter experience holographic Beechcraft as well.

190
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,450
And in all of these cases. Thanks using a sample

191
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,550
of Monte Carlo, the uncertainty as they come along

192
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,070
are under control and can be systematically

193
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,230
improved if we just. I tackle the problem with

194
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,710
additional resources, or if we come up with more

195
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,310
clever and more efficient algorithms. That the.

196
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:26,630
Get more bang for your computer, Buck. So. That,

197
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,330
of course, lettuce field theory is an example

198
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,280
within the mathematical sciences, so it's.

199
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,200
Perhaps intuitively obvious that statistical

200
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,260
physics can be relevant and applicable to this.

201
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,540
Sociology is an example of the discipline well

202
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,660
beyond mathematical sciences, where it may be more

203
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,690
surprising that statistical physics has anything

204
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:58,500
to say. But there is a. Diverse and active field

205
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,920
calling itself social physics, that is.

206
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,940
Credible and able to use the tools of statistical

207
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,320
physics to accurately describe various aspects of

208
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,390
the social and political behavior of humans, and

209
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,360
one particular example that is so easy to get a

210
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,530
grip on and see how statistical physics can

211
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,430
connect to these sorts of political behavioral

212
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:40,300
dynamics is what we call voter models, which have

213
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,600
been around for half a century or more, used to

214
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,380
model not only elections, but also the process of.

215
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,850
Debates and opinion, information concerning

216
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,120
various different questions about political

217
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,850
propositions, individual candidates or political

218
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,420
parties.

219
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,850
Where? The question itself is boiled down to baked

220
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,810
into the definition of this model. Individuals are

221
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,100
represented as spin degrees of freedom, similar to

222
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,380
the easy model for the value of the spin

223
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,070
represents the opinion that they hold on whatever

224
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,300
question or candidate is under consideration. So

225
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,590
we can say that the spin indicates support for

226
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,340
this candidate or question downstairs indicates

227
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,020
opposition and the interactions between different

228
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,000
voters have some drive to align the voters with

229
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,180
each other through that process of debate and

230
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,840
discussion on this topic. And then there are

231
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,290
various ways this can be generalized beyond the

232
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:57,720
easy model itself, because adding a third option,

233
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,070
the value zero indicator, people who don't

234
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:06,000
actually have an opinion on whatever is under

235
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,730
consideration, or we can extend the range of

236
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,400
opinions to quantify how strongly different people

237
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:18,060
might hold. Some might be very committed to their

238
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,220
opinion and wanted to change it and eager to

239
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,960
change other people's minds. Some people might

240
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,130
might not be neutral, might not care enough to

241
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,550
make a big deal out of that. Can be. Incorporated

242
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,400
into this model, these sorts of generalizations,

243
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,220
but perhaps the key generalization, distinguishing

244
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,820
all models from the easy model is the.

245
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,620
The draft structure that's there to find out why

246
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,980
use the word drafts rather than Baathists, because

247
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,740
they should be. Not as regular as the lattice

248
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,780
structure that we've been dealing with, different

249
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,810
people can have many different interactions, both

250
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,440
with different numbers of individuals and also

251
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,320
interactions that carry greater or lesser weights

252
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,470
similar to the different coupling and the links

253
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,040
that we've introduced for the easier model. So

254
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,920
maybe the picture is worth many words about this.

255
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,460
So what's shown here is an example of this sort of

256
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,670
graph coming from the publication of about 10

257
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,850
years ago illustrating how things can work in one

258
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,680
of the simple cases where there are only two

259
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,100
possibilities. So let's open up his clues and down

260
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:38,520
this color red. And in this particular analysis,

261
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,810
the. Well, you can start off by seeing that

262
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:47,340
depending on which person we should note in this

263
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,980
graph we're considering, it could have different

264
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,460
numbers of connections to the other nodes or even

265
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,960
some that are isolated all by themselves, some

266
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,880
that have a very dense collection of links to many

267
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,710
other individuals. And the key feature of the

268
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,980
model that was being analyzed in this work was

269
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,360
that. The graph was dynamic and evolving, these

270
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,650
links between different individuals would be

271
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:26,140
repeated and destroyed with greater probability

272
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,590
for creation between people with similar opinions

273
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,410
on this topic and a greater probability for

274
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,720
severing links between people with opposing views.

275
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,470
The.

276
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,850
Result of this particular analysis that included

277
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,210
that that type of evolution of the graph structure

278
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:54,520
itself was a phase transition to two different

279
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:00,360
phases here. Once the system is reached, one of

280
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,320
these spaces was characterized by a consensus that

281
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,320
developed the vast majority of the individuals

282
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,460
with only a few outliers, whereas the other things

283
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,000
that is pictured here saw the whole population

284
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,730
become increasingly polarized, splitting into

285
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,850
distinct groups that increasingly only had

286
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,690
connections with those who shared their opinion

287
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,930
on this topic. And over time, there was a clear

288
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,580
boundary forming between those groups with fairly

289
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,170
few relatively small number of connections

290
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,800
crossing that boundary and that sort of behavior.

291
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,970
That polarization, which drew stable, long lasting

292
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:50,730
camps with opposing views, also appears in simpler

293
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,440
analysis or simple models that keep the

294
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,820
connections fixed. Is there are connections of

295
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,460
individuals lives that are very difficult to to

296
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,800
suffer long term friends or family, even with the

297
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,570
connections fixed and not being created or severed?

298
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,150
A similar transition to consensus can result once

299
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,320
an opinion reaches a critical concentration that

300
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,720
can be quantified through numerical multicar

301
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,280
calculations, and there is a possibility for these

302
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,970
so-called stable consensus spaces where even

303
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,550
though the population is roughly evenly split. The.

304
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,930
The different opinions are. Concentrated in two

305
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,650
clusters of voters that agree with each other and

306
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,710
interact with each other with only limited

307
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,110
interaction with those who have the opposite

308
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,770
opinion, and the only difference compared to this

309
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,550
work with the evolving graph is the interpretation

310
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,130
where.

311
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,510
Now, instead of forming or breaking connections

312
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,270
between people with civil war or opposing views,

313
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,480
the main dynamics of people's lives changing

314
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,720
depending on who they interact with, a fixed

315
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,180
pattern. And, of course, in general, you can have

316
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:27,670
both sorts of contributions in the mix at the same

317
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,530
time. So.

318
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,800
A caveat, caveat that you can see in this is that

319
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,550
there are lots of modeling choices you can make

320
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,760
and know the fundamental theory of human

321
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,630
interaction to guide them. What has to be done is

322
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,590
to compare the predictions of these sorts of

323
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:54,000
calculations with actual observations of opinion

324
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,710
polls and election results, which can then

325
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,970
validate various different aspects of the model or

326
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,870
invalidate them as the case may be.

327
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:11,610
So that, I think, is something about voter models,

328
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,190
which are a nice place to start due to their

329
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,800
similarity with the U.S. model. And maybe

330
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,860
something else that might be more familiar these

331
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,030
days is using.

332
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,860
Interactive statistical systems to battle the

333
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,710
spread of disease in populations.

334
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,730
The degrees of freedom are, again, individuals

335
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,520
interested in. The interactions of these degrees

336
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,550
of freedom with each other are now influencing

337
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,540
whether or not susceptible individuals pick up

338
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,200
whatever infection is present in the broader.

339
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,010
Population and.

340
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,580
We

341
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:03,700
go through this link in the. Lecture notes, we can

342
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,110
see.

343
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:13,380
Some quick examples of the sorts of problems with

344
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,400
that, this is a quick example of. A simple

345
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,600
modeling of spread of some disease from the ground

346
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,110
with the disease and their interactions with the

347
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,820
folks who have not yet had the disease spread the

348
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:37,080
infection until eventually almost everyone is ill

349
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:44,370
and gradually recover. In this case. And. Just by

350
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:50,670
a an amusing coincidence, the two hundred little

351
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:55,120
circles that are bouncing around in this. A little

352
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,630
simulation. Which is different every time with a

353
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,610
different set of pseudo random numbers being

354
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:05,230
sampled. This is very nearly the same scale as the

355
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,870
very first important sampling multicolor that was

356
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:11,340
ever done by Petropolis, Rosenbluth and Teller in

357
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,890
nineteen fifty three, where they looked at two

358
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,100
hundred twenty four discs in a two dimensional

359
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,760
volume and computed the pressure of the equation

360
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,600
of state from Montecarlo. Important sample. So

361
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,570
back in nineteen fifty three, this calculation

362
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,520
took several days and the most powerful

363
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,820
supercomputers in existence. And now it's quick

364
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,480
and easy to run on your phone without incurring

365
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,450
any significant stress on the processor or the

366
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,280
battery. And by.

367
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:49,100
Tossing in further similar generalizations to this

368
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:53,330
type of modeling, somewhat similar to voter models,

369
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,870
you can back up the effects of, say, closed

370
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:01,730
borders or more general quarantines. You can see

371
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,810
what happens if a border that was closed happens

372
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,630
to bump involved. The disease is still spreading

373
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,010
on one side and quickly passes into the other. Or

374
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:19,430
if you suppose that some of the individuals, the

375
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,610
degrees of freedom in the simulation are locked

376
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,400
down and not moving around. So in this case, I

377
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,030
think three quarters of the population is fixed in

378
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:34,880
place. And the number of. Sick individuals grows

379
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,990
much more slowly as a consequence of that is there

380
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,570
are fewer. InterAction's.

381
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,090
Occurring to spread that disease, which can even

382
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,630
be made even more extreme by supposing that seven

383
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:56,410
eighths of the population is. Stuck in place. And

384
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:02,230
we can compare what we're used at once to judge

385
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:09,120
what sorts of interventions and. Can help to

386
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,210
reduce the numbers of sick individuals over time

387
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,750
and in some cases even protect some people from

388
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,160
falling ill at all. And.

389
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,900
This is obviously a very simplistic and

390
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,850
unrealistic example put out by The Washington Post,

391
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,780
but larger scale and more realistic versions of

392
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,630
these sorts of epidemiological simulations.

393
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,910
Some of which are connected to research in the

394
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,910
School of Engineering here in Liverpool, Simon

395
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,620
Maskell's group of distributed, distributed

396
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,660
algorithms to do the sort of thing quickly and

397
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:00,100
efficiently that feeds into government operations

398
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,800
and depending on the government, can help guide

399
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,770
the decisions about what restrictions to impose in

400
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:09,250
the interests of public health and how long it

401
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:14,470
would be best to retain those restrictions. And

402
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,410
just to connect this with the actual content of

403
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,780
our module, the.

404
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,970
As we discussed in Section one point, to enforce

405
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,560
laying the foundations for.

406
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,140
Probability spaces and statistical ensembles. Each

407
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,140
of these numerical simulations needs to be

408
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:39,010
repeated many times, just slightly more sets of

409
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:43,810
random numbers in order to gain some control over

410
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,900
the central values of the predictions and also the

411
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:51,820
scale fluctuations that come out to quantify what

412
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,230
the proper advice is and what weight it should

413
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,900
carry, how reliable it is in terms of its

414
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,400
uncertainty, its various.

415
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,620
So feel free to ask any questions you have about

416
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,250
any of these topics or generalizations, if there's

417
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,660
just one last

418
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,710
voter application to another biological example

419
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:30,160
there. Various animals can. Where am I going here?

420
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:39,750
Exhibit. Collective behavior examples can be both

421
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,290
flocks of birds or swarms of insects or even

422
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,730
traffic on busy streets or crowds of pedestrians

423
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:52,280
and as an example to. Actually show you what I'm

424
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,440
talking about, rather than just trying to explain

425
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,470
the words, I'm not talking about family, but we'll

426
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,840
get through. Or go down five.

427
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:12,340
And look at this flock of several hundred or

428
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:16,750
possibly thousand starlings in Europe that are

429
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:22,490
carrying out some coordinated motion. Forming

430
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,070
shapeshifting clowns that.

431
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,850
Break merged together and.

432
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,230
In general, wander across the sky with some

433
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,340
influence from possible predators searching for

434
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,790
food or other external driving processes.

435
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,180
Turn down the volume

436
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,110
over

437
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:59,670
water and see the individual degrees of freedom at

438
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,080
its most elevated, relatively small number of

439
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,490
physics terms.

440
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:09,270
All of which are. Coordinating with each other

441
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:15,660
much more tightly than you. Well, we expect just

442
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:21,030
from all of these animals. Behaving independently,

443
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:28,090
so the. Interpretation of this, the body of this

444
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,570
in terms of statistical physics is to.

445
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:39,770
Model them as model, use this sort of behavior or

446
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:45,350
swarming with just the emotion of crowds as an

447
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:51,250
interacting gas. Of particles that have a tendency

448
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:57,220
to align the direction of their motions with the.

449
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,970
Fractured emotion of there, of the particles that

450
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,880
are near them, as this is a guess, what particles

451
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,370
are near them is varying over time. And about

452
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,300
twenty five years ago, one of the foundational

453
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,150
models in this sort of analysis was published is,

454
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,980
again, one of those where it's named only after

455
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,390
the first author would have five or six authors

456
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:27,220
that work during nouns

457
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:34,480
that provide formulated the statistical physics

458
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,040
model for particles in a gas interacting with each

459
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,340
other to avoid the direction of their motion and

460
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,390
show two different phases, one in which the

461
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,270
average angle of the motion of all the particles

462
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:54,130
of that gas is disordered. So it averages to zero.

463
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,370
And another phase in which there was a. Long

464
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:03,840
distance or large scale order among the directions

465
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,180
in which many departments are moving, which then

466
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:10,810
produces these sorts of patterns, they're called

467
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:16,070
reverberations, is for Fox because shapeshifting

468
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,680
flaps.

469
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:23,600
And ever since the mid 90s, there's been lots of

470
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,100
time to apply, refine and test these sorts of

471
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,120
models with a good deal of success, empirical

472
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,690
verification that the statistical physics analysis.

473
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:42,530
Is. A good basis on which to analyze this sort of

474
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:50,910
behavior so that on Tuesday there was a paper

475
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,840
published that.

476
00:32:54,390 --> 00:33:00,970
Inc. another. Variable into. Models of this sort

477
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,900
allowing the. The birds, the particles to change

478
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,470
their change, their speed and its magnitude, as

479
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,100
well as its direction, which allowed them to

480
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,900
obtain good agreement with observations of flocks

481
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,190
ranging from as few as it was a couple of dozen

482
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:29,160
birds, up to several thousand. Qualify by filling

483
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,620
those those blocks of the high speed camera and

484
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,670
quantifying the overall shape of the properties of

485
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:39,800
that order phase that they were forming. And one

486
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,170
thing that we can do actually with this

487
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,700
statistical physics model is Helen. Is become a

488
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,670
bit more quantitative about what these phrases

489
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,160
really are and particularly the existence of a

490
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,060
bona fide phase transition between them. So rather

491
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,680
than be qualitative and saying. In some cases,

492
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,280
they're just ordered some places that look like so

493
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,490
you can express things in terms of that or rather

494
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:13,210
the average fight and map out the prediction of

495
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:16,630
the model, depending on the density of the

496
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,880
particles and the systems and what the density is

497
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,600
low where there are few interactions with those

498
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,620
interactions are we could strength we end up with

499
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,350
particles that are more free to move in any

500
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,220
direction that do not been for many of those

501
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,680
migrations or storms and high density. This is

502
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,980
where that changes and this large scale collective

503
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,230
motion can appear arising just from those

504
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,820
interactions between. The individual particles in

505
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,600
the system, rather than without having to put in

506
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,860
any modelling of the

507
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,800
whole large scale collection of all those degrees

508
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,260
of freedom, just the interactions between the

509
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:08,990
individual microscopic particles predicts the

510
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,490
large scale behavior through the process of

511
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:17,620
statistical physics. And depending on exactly what

512
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:23,170
variation of this model you apply, you can predict

513
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,140
either a first or second or the transition between

514
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,720
those two faces. Again, those are both defined in

515
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,630
that thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of

516
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,370
particles. And

517
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,650
the with these finite flocks of observe, the best

518
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,450
thing we can do is try to map out the. Dependence

519
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,400
on the size of the flock that is covered by the

520
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:50,110
critical exposures in the case of a second order

521
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,870
phase transition, there are a few models that

522
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:58,070
predict difference universality classes for those

523
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,550
critical experience and can in principle be either

524
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:06,220
confirmed or ruled out by the observations. Of

525
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,690
these migrations in nature, and I'll also mention

526
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:17,120
that in some cases there is severe diffusion, so

527
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,340
anomalous diffusion just like that, and the

528
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:24,220
computer project where certain of these birds end

529
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:27,760
up randomly walking very far distances, much more

530
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,790
quickly than you would expect from the ordinary

531
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,500
law of diffusion coming from the central.

532
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:41,290
So those are sort of for fun illustrations of how

533
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,030
the concepts and tools of statistical physics can

534
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,390
be recognized or applied in. Domains very far from

535
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,140
sophistical physics, both within and even beyond

536
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,520
mathematical sciences.

537
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,110
Looking at the time we made it, may as well just.

538
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:12,310
Back up with. A quick look back at what we've done

539
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:16,510
through this term, which is the section in the

540
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:20,650
lecture notes, is mostly therefore for you and for

541
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,610
others who may be watching the recording to have a

542
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,680
quick reference guide to what was discussed,

543
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,180
whether from one unit to the next, and also to see

544
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:35,050
how those topics flowed from one to the other,

545
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:39,640
starting with the definition of probability

546
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,420
foundations in that unit, one looking at

547
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,990
expectation, values and stochastic systems that

548
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:50,590
involve large numbers of degrees of freedom, where

549
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:55,430
the central limit theorem relates stable, large

550
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:59,320
and properties of that full system to the.

551
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,610
Underlying elementary degrees of freedom that

552
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:08,050
allows for stable behavior to emerge even from

553
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,790
random or at least Karslake processes from

554
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,010
resolving one of the historic debates around the

555
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:21,310
origins of statistical physics and the existence

556
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:25,570
of atoms and molecules as the components of large

557
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,100
scale substances like gas fields.

558
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,890
And the particular

559
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:38,830
sort of probability spaces that we are focusing on

560
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:43,060
in the specific context of statistical physics are

561
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:48,160
not surprising. Statistical samples where the.

562
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:53,310
The.

563
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,920
As community spaces, statistical ensembles are

564
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,810
viewed as a collection of microstates that's

565
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,870
subsystem of a large number of particles can adopt

566
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:11,700
as it evolves in time and if it adopts each of

567
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,790
these microstates with some corresponding

568
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:20,340
probability. And by imposing laws of nature like

569
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,570
the conservation of energy and the conservation of

570
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,320
particle, no, we define various sorts of

571
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,140
statistical ensembles through the resulting

572
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,650
constraints. The micro canonical ensemble is the

573
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:39,450
most direct example where conservation of energy

574
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,530
is imposed on the system itself, which implies

575
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,860
that it must be completely isolated from all the

576
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,860
rest of the universe, unable to exchange any

577
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,690
energy or particles.

578
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:01,880
And gets to the temperature being derived. From

579
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,510
the fundamental conservative quantity, the energy.

580
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:11,990
No. And through the second law of thermodynamics,

581
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:15,280
the first being that conservation of energy, Iran

582
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:20,180
will show that the entropy is always not decrease

583
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:24,620
in function as time passes so that we can identify

584
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:29,610
something that's real by searching for. The

585
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:33,390
condition of maximum entropy that we then applied

586
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,720
to a more practical set up to be that three was

587
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,060
called the canonical ensemble. We're canonical

588
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,300
does carry the meaning that this is the usual one

589
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,960
we would work with, where the system is allowed to

590
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,580
exchange energy with some large reservoir that

591
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,740
fixes the temperature and the particle number

592
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:57,980
itself is still fixed, so. The ability of the

593
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,900
system to interact with the rest of the universe

594
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,530
is what allows us to set it up, manipulate it and

595
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:08,750
observe it and measure quantities such as the

596
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,070
capacity entropy and now the internal energy as

597
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,840
observables rather than the defining qualities.

598
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:24,210
And by maximizing entropy to impose them going to

599
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:29,500
have to keep. We define partition function where

600
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,480
equivalently the.

601
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,990
Helmholtz, free energy is the water in the world,

602
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,650
that petition function, which are the starting

603
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:42,660
points for driving all of this? Essentially, it is

604
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,810
like. Energy capacity, so we looked at. Some of

605
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:51,400
those convictions for the case of simple,

606
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,240
distinguishable, indisputable systems have not

607
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,410
attracted expense. Where is that pure information

608
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,660
content, whether or not the degrees of freedom

609
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:05,800
could be distinguished, led to observable changes

610
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:11,950
in energy and entropy. And we also do torrealba

611
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:16,860
able to. Consider or analyze models like the phone

612
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:20,610
and the better, the devices of cell phones that

613
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,460
reproduce experimental measurements for the heat

614
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:29,130
capacities of various materials. Maybe one useful.

615
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,560
Aspect of this work to highlight was the trick of

616
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,740
simplifying the system by looking at this behavior

617
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,570
in the high temperature limits and avoiding work,

618
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:44,250
using that to guide our analysis of the more

619
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,400
complicated situation of intermediate temperatures.

620
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,200
So with the economic slowdown and we went through

621
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:56,540
two main applications. So we're looking at

622
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:03,780
classical novelistic ideal gas's. Well. We went

623
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,630
through that same process of regulating the theory

624
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,110
by democratizing the movement and then taking the

625
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,320
limits of continuous variation that replace those

626
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,730
discrete cells with continuous.

627
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:26,350
And. Also. Derive the pressure and I guess as an

628
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:30,070
equation of state, also looking at the mixing of

629
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:34,870
two gases, if they're distinguishable in the same

630
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:39,430
particles, which can be distinguishable in case

631
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:42,730
produced a non-zero mixing entropy corresponding

632
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,540
to an irreversible process. In contrast to that is

633
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:51,430
that in this case, we're combining and we separate

634
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:55,140
the gases is reversible and can be done with no

635
00:43:55,150 --> 00:44:01,160
obstruction. And then. Further building on. Those

636
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,450
concerns about the Agassiz took systems of ideal

637
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:08,870
gases, put them in some container in contact with

638
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:13,760
two external thermal reservoirs, one them coal,

639
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,200
and use the flow of heat from the reservoir to the

640
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,120
core reservoir through the idea of gas as a way to

641
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:24,610
extract work.

642
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:32,920
On the violence definably, the tension. Which

643
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,490
involves not just the flow of heat, but also

644
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:40,960
various manipulations, expanding and pressing or

645
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,340
just holding the volume fixed for the system and

646
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:52,060
by. Introducing preferably diagrams of the entropy

647
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,720
temperature diagrams. We had a nice visual mediums

648
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:01,150
to monitor sequences of some of those processes

649
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:05,410
that. Produce a close group that can be repeated

650
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:09,720
arbitrarily many times to finance the cycles of.

651
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,760
That can produce a steady flow of work from that

652
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,750
heat transfer or going the other way. Can take we

653
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,050
can use work that we've done on the system to

654
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:23,920
transfer these.

655
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:30,330
And operate as a refrigerator, so the.

656
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,810
Balance of the work that a heat engine is able to

657
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,540
produce based on the amount of heat it is to

658
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,530
operate, it finds its efficiency. And we spent

659
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:47,910
some time showing that the cycle achieves the

660
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:51,470
maximum possible efficiency. That is allowed by

661
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,650
the second law that whereas other psychos on the

662
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:59,600
other side of this cycle model, the operation of

663
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,360
internal combustion engines are less efficient,

664
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:06,380
but have access to greater sources of heat through

665
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,890
burning fuel rather than waiting for heat transfer.

666
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:14,610
And the third and final statistical example we

667
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,870
looked at further generalizes to the situation by

668
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:21,010
putting the system in contact with the progress

669
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,170
that allows both the energy and the number of

670
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:29,250
particles to fluctuate while the temperature and

671
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:35,820
chemical potential are kept fixed. And. We did the

672
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,680
same sort of interview maximization to find some

673
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:44,660
dynamic equilibrium. That's gave us the tools to

674
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:49,310
apply this to systems of quantum gases. The other

675
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:52,800
main ingredient for me to be part of the system is

676
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,960
that rather than looking at all of the possible

677
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,770
microstates of a single particle and then. I'm

678
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:05,390
just taking the power of that single political

679
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:08,030
prediction function to define the important

680
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:12,080
opposition function. We saw how that approach can

681
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,620
break down when there's a measurable probability

682
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:19,220
for the idea for multiple identical articles to

683
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:22,370
occupy the same energy level, whereas instead the

684
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:26,680
quantum approach. But considering the energy

685
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,590
levels themselves, the organization microstates in

686
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:33,130
terms of possible occupation numbers for each of

687
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:36,550
those energy bills, gets around that problem and

688
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:39,970
allows two different types of quantum particles to

689
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:43,570
be distinguished. The boatswain's. That can have

690
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:47,110
any number of identical bosun's occupying the same

691
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:52,360
energy level, while fermions can only have at most

692
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:58,710
one identical formula in any given energy. I also

693
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:04,420
notice the exclusion principle and in the limit of

694
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,610
high temperatures with sufficiently negative

695
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,490
chemical potentials that you can no virgin recover

696
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:18,240
the classical limit. And the. Earlier approach

697
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,320
that we talked about, so just to wrap up the

698
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,840
applications more quickly, is that getting more

699
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:30,900
recent? We looked at the full time gas with the.

700
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:36,740
Those Einstein statistics and an. And the grand

701
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,740
finale coopetition function from the ensemble,

702
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:44,390
seeing how it provides a good model both for solar

703
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:47,390
radiation as well as the cosmic microwave

704
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:50,960
background, even though it's making the assumption

705
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:57,410
that all of these photons are not attractive. That

706
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:02,930
turns out to be not an issue in throughout that

707
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:05,840
whole range, from the coldest to the hottest

708
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,750
regions of the of the universe.

709
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,970
And similarly, looking at not attractive females,

710
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:19,080
we focused on the low temperature regime. So where

711
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:23,820
the family function that defines the occupation

712
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:29,170
number of fermions as a function of energy purpose

713
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:32,250
is a step function at low temperatures where all

714
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,670
of the low lying energy levels are filled by the

715
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:39,750
single phenomenon that can occupy them. And the

716
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:44,070
higher energy levels are all empty, which defines

717
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:47,730
the fairly energy is the boundary between the

718
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:51,960
filled and empty sets of energy levels and also

719
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,280
leaves a non-zero energy and a non-zero degeneracy

720
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,340
pressure even in the limits of absolute zero

721
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:03,810
temperature. That plays a key role in Type 1A

722
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:07,680
supernova as being possible. And since the spring

723
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,500
break, we've spent all our time looking at this

724
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,590
reaction, interacting statistical systems where

725
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,850
there are a broader based model to consider, but

726
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:21,660
also a lot more difficulty in analyzing the

727
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:24,900
systems precisely because of the interactions that

728
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:30,360
keep the factories into a bunch of contributions

729
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:36,250
from independent single particles. So the. Testbed

730
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:40,750
for all of this was the easy model of interacting

731
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:44,750
spins on a lattice of the dimensions where you

732
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:48,310
were able to obtain some exact results in one in

733
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:52,780
two dimensions. Compare those to the mean

734
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:59,350
approximation and in higher dimensions. Look a bit

735
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:03,370
this week at the numerical methods that are

736
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:07,400
broadly applicable. Not only to the U.S. model,

737
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:12,890
but to a vast swath of interactive statistical

738
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:22,100
systems, both within and sciences, so. The. Basic

739
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,340
three pillars of that margin were the foundations

740
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,500
like these, the physical examples of the walls of

741
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,940
the premix applications to things like ideal gases,

742
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,870
thermodynamic cycles and conditions, along with

743
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:39,200
some more advanced topics like numerical methods,

744
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:44,840
universality. And that is the model that

745
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,400
you enjoy the trip and is the master.

746
00:51:58,890 --> 00:51:59,580
Yeah, so

747
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,880
that is correct. Everything that we've gone

748
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,760
through the lectures, it's fair game for the exam

749
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:14,330
and I guess you'll see in a couple of weeks what

750
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,510
what turns out to be out there. I have the get

751
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:24,050
about the play. There are two sample exams on the.

752
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:30,780
I can kill this. This is one of them where there

753
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:36,720
is indeed a question on fazing bottle. This is an

754
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,200
illustration of the sort of thing you can expect,

755
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:43,950
but we are well over time already. So to leave the

756
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:48,690
sample exams on the module's page for you to

757
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,230
explore on your own, yet feel free to contact me

758
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,560
with any questions about the program that's at.

759
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:02,540
Sancta.
