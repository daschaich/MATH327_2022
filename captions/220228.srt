1
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,490
OK, the bells are ringing, so let's start to get things set up

2
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,360
and in focus.

3
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,150
The attendance system number four today is

4
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,570
seven two, seven six, three

5
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,440
one.

6
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,000
Welcome to the end of February.  The days are

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,580
getting longer, though it's not obvious when the

8
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:57,350
weather's like this.  At least the projector should

9
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,700
be more visible in these conditions with less glare. Are

10
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,910
there any immediate questions from last week before we

11
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,550
pick up where we left off and continue on this

12
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:09,880
week.

13
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,780
Let's go through a quick recap to.

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,170
Remember where we were and where we're headed.

15
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,560
For.

16
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,450
February.

17
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,460
So we have been looking at.

18
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,400
Ideal gas is through the economical ensemble.

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,760
Which is the experimental setup, the situation

20
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,700
where we fixed the temperature in the protocol

21
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:04,260
number of the particles in this gas. And the.

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,290
Energy levels are a starting point for statistical

23
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,750
analysis of many political systems.

24
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:23,010
Turned out to. We define that. In terms of the

25
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,840
voyeurweb. In which this ideal guest is. Can find

26
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,140
his style. We are taking to the. A Cuban box

27
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,600
belonging to the three sides, both sides in three

28
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,810
dimensions. And. From those energy levels, the.

29
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,390
Compute the canonical partition function.

30
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,480
And see how they differ or distinguishable.

31
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,970
Versus indistinguishable particles.

32
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,180
Short order, and so the canonical protection

33
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,380
function for indistinguishable particles is just

34
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,810
in powers of a single particle. Protection

35
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,230
function, and this differs by effective, in fact,

36
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,840
will compare to the case where the particles are

37
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,660
indistinguishable. And this leads on to. The same

38
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,890
results. For the average internal energy that can

39
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,690
be distinguishable, indistinguishable pieces, both

40
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,780
of which are three halves times the number of

41
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,450
particles times the temperature. But different

42
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,290
entropies.

43
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,820
Reflecting the different number of microstates

44
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,550
that we can have a smaller number in the

45
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:04,220
dismissable case. The three havstein plus 10 times

46
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,350
war could be over. The cube of the thermal

47
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,190
wavelength, it depends on the mass of the

48
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,780
particles, their temperature and plank's comes to

49
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,640
take part in the indistinguishable case decreases

50
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,620
to five heads,

51
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,170
plus a similar ratio now and again, factor being

52
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:39,520
subtracted and disinterment. Led to the so-called

53
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,630
Gibs paradox.

54
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,680
Tried to go through slowly and carefully on Friday,

55
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,030
looking at.

56
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,780
The. Different behavior that results when. Yes,

57
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,540
it's either distinguishable or INDISTINCTIVE, the

58
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,430
particles are mixed or allowed to be exchanged

59
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,990
between two phones through the sequence of steps

60
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:18,280
show. In these three squares, finding in the case

61
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,710
of insatiable radicals.

62
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,380
That the. Mixing was reversible, and the

63
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,970
activities of all three of those stages were.

64
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,280
Exactly the same.

65
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,000
And this. It was, at least historically, the

66
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,650
origin of paradox, and folks believed that the

67
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,130
sort of mixing of particles was always going to be

68
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,720
reversible. And we went through the mathematics

69
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,240
where the distinguishable case.

70
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,860
We found that. The process was irreversible.

71
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,730
There was a definite increase in the entropy going

72
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:17,670
from the initial separated subsystems to the

73
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:22,340
combined system where they were allowed to mix and

74
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,170
and quality of handwaving arguments that. The

75
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,750
final individual interviews would be the same,

76
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,880
would then require a decrease in injury from that

77
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,010
combined system to the final set up, which would

78
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,010
contradict the second ballot for the Debix by

79
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,180
being more careful about precisely how these

80
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,970
attributes are calculated. We were able to confirm

81
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,060
that there is, in fact, no paradox here, and the

82
00:06:53,060 --> 00:07:00,500
entropy continues to remain the same as the wall

83
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,580
between these two subsystems is reinserted in that

84
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:10,280
final step. And that is where we ended up on

85
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,590
Friday. As you go through carefully, this three

86
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,230
step procedure in these two different cases of

87
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,630
distinguishable versus indistinguishable particles,

88
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,520
illustrating the different behavior that results

89
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,630
just based on the information content about the

90
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:35,000
systems that we can access in principle. So we are

91
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,020
going now to turn to a slightly different topic.

92
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,580
So this is the last call for questions about what

93
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,250
came up last week, and especially in the context

94
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,400
of this thought experiment of mixing particles

95
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,090
between systems that we separated.

96
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:06,550
Not hearing any. We have this next topic, so we'll

97
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,760
be able to zoom in on. Now to make it more legible.

98
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,110
Gets back to the starting point for this ideal gas,

99
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,130
it's and the fact that when we were first.

100
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,430
Constructing the precision functions and figuring

101
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,920
out how to sum over all of the possible

102
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,120
microstates of these systems, we saw that in

103
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,850
addition to the fixed temperature and particle

104
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,030
number that always characterise systems in the

105
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,620
canonical ensemble, there was dependence on the

106
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,830
volume within which this gas was contained. And

107
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:56,540
this introduces in addition to the. At the usual

108
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,800
temperature of the number that were used to the

109
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,750
volume as an additional control forever or

110
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,840
something that we can imagine experimentally

111
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,530
manipulating, changing in some way, which will

112
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:14,780
cause some response of the. Behavior of the system

113
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,170
coming through its partition function and

114
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,120
generally through the

115
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,430
particular energies of the individual, microstates

116
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,520
that enter into that petition function from which

117
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:35,120
we were able to derive. All of the. Observable is

118
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,200
of interest in the canonical ensemble, so we

119
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,990
didn't see this sort of thing earlier, even

120
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,690
microeconomic ensemble is the magnetic field

121
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,100
strength age for cinema systems. That was a

122
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,300
parameter that we could imagine in experimental

123
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,070
set up, take our system, expose it to a larger,

124
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,620
stronger magnetic field. We don't want it to feel

125
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,700
get a different behavior as a consequence. But if

126
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,310
we focus now on the ideal gases.

127
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,700
Even though this dependence on the volume dropped

128
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,370
out of the internal energy.

129
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,070
Average internal energy being just three halves

130
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,560
empty for both distinguishable and

131
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,670
indistinguishable particles. Dependence remains in

132
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,610
both cases for the entropies. For both types of

133
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,860
particles, and in particular, it is. Entering as a

134
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,030
ratio, the volume divided by the cube of this

135
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,620
Somodevilla wavelength. Which brings together a

136
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,350
particular combination of programmers, thermal

137
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,170
deviling wavelength, we can remember what right

138
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,230
down the whole expression of this recall is

139
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,080
proportional to one over the square root of

140
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,340
temperature. So that ratio of the over land cube

141
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:18,180
is then proportional to the times. The three has

142
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:23,160
power of temperature. And if.

143
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,510
The volume and temperature are changed in such a

144
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:34,550
way that this. Constant product, the volume times

145
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,040
temperature of the three have power is constant

146
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,780
then with the particle number also fixed. We see

147
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,040
that the overall entropy of these systems is

148
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,280
constant even as we change the volume and the

149
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,900
temperature.

150
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,880
This is going to be significant when we analyze

151
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,270
the damage cycles coming up possibly later today

152
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,510
or tomorrow. The latest. Processes in which we

153
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,130
change the control parameters of our system but

154
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,130
leave the entropy constant in some way, are known

155
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,170
as entropic, which is just a construction based on

156
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,410
the Greek word isostatic means equal. So these are

157
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,800
processes that leave the entropy equal from the

158
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:32,240
beginning and the end. When? We imagine making

159
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,060
changes to control parameters like the volume and

160
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,830
the temperature. We've already seen these sorts of

161
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,740
changes, the control parameters, for instance, the

162
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:48,520
canonical ensemble. We had the temperature being

163
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,980
defined as the change of entropy with the change

164
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,930
in the conserve energy in the canonical context

165
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,040
was considered. So the response of the entropy to

166
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,830
a change in the conserved energy and already in

167
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,120
the canonical ensemble, the heat capacity which is

168
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,870
showing up in your home due Thursday, is another

169
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:22,510
example of this sort of change, in that case, the

170
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:28,030
change in that energy with respect to temperature.

171
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:36,980
With the volume fixed. Here. Motivated to some

172
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,890
extent by that heat capacity, just slid off the

173
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,310
screen there, we can think about flipping the

174
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:48,380
roles of Temperature Boy and.

175
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,170
And. Defined in that way, the pressure for an

176
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,370
ideal gas, which.

177
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,250
We'll get into a bit more thoroughly later on, is

178
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,910
connected to some changes. Imagine taking some

179
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:13,040
ideal gas in a container and talk to you about

180
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,920
thinking of that ideal gas inside a building. We

181
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,040
try to change the volume of that building by

182
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,790
squeezing it into some smaller space, the small

183
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,780
box. We feel a force opposing our attempts to

184
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,970
change that volume. The force is arising from the

185
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:37,090
pressure of the gas as we try to change its mind.

186
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,730
And specifically, we define the pressure to be the

187
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,860
change in the internal energy, the drive quantity

188
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,340
of one somewhat due to infinitesimal change the

189
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:56,700
volume with the entropy caps fixed. So the fancy

190
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,490
terminology that we introduced this pressure is

191
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,330
the isotropic response of the internal energy to

192
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,700
the volume of the ideal gas.

193
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,740
And the. One.

194
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,730
Possible cause for concern about this sort of

195
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,880
definition or discussion in general is whether you

196
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:27,190
may depart from. The defining conditions of the

197
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,750
economic cycle, if we are to talk about changes in

198
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,940
volume or, for instance, changes in temperature

199
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:45,080
and the heat capacity. And similar to the similar

200
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,140
concerns could have come up when we introduced the

201
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,400
temperatures drive quality, a case where we can

202
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,510
get around this by supposing that when we have

203
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:04,980
some process that changes the. Um. Characteristics

204
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,660
of the system we are considering in particular is

205
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,890
temperature of volume, internal energy. We can

206
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,390
analyze such a process still within the canonical

207
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:24,890
ensemble. I am treating it so, viewing it as a

208
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,270
change from one canonical system with a fixed

209
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,570
temperature and particle, no. To some other

210
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,840
economical system. Again, all of these enfolded

211
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:41,650
equilibrium. With differenced. Temperatures

212
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,550
defining difference in global systems and then

213
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,850
considering the process through which we

214
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,640
transition from one of these large scale systems

215
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,110
to another.

216
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,170
So as a. The first example of this is the ideal

217
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:08,310
gas we have. Since just last week, this condition

218
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,840
for the continental ideal gas, regardless of

219
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,610
whether the particles in this gas are

220
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:21,050
distinguishable or indistinguishable. That is this

221
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,930
combination, the volume times, the three heads

222
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,850
power of the temperature is some possible call for

223
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,250
convenience, C, that the power we have so that I

224
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,690
can rearrange this equation and we get the

225
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:42,710
temperature being related to this constant C times

226
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,450
the volume to the minus two thirds power, dividing

227
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,780
three by the volume two thirds power of each side.

228
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,480
And when. The temperature and volume of this

229
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,650
relation. The entropy is constant. We have.

230
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,470
Isotropic.

231
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,590
Process.

232
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,550
And going back again to what we drive last week,

233
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,900
you can insert

234
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,050
this relation, this condition for the entropy of

235
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,160
the process to be constants into the internal

236
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,090
energy as a function of the particle number and

237
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:28,810
the temperature.

238
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,340
That now becomes, in the case of entropy, a

239
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,640
function of particle number and the volume being

240
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,040
raised to the power of minus two thirds, then

241
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,210
plugging this expression into our new definition

242
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:54,590
of the pressure, along with the pressure for life,

243
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,890
you'll get us all to a head in with the substances

244
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,950
that the unenlightening.

245
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,970
Algebraic manipulations. The point is that by

246
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:15,160
expressing the energy in terms of the conditions

247
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,910
for entropy be are satisfying the cause of entropy

248
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,720
condition that defines the volume. And given the

249
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,330
result, that is minus three C of the two and is a

250
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,270
constant factor that comes up front and then the

251
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,270
derivative of the power minus two thirds with

252
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:40,640
respect to the Z factor of minus two thirds or

253
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,340
whatever, the same B to the minus two thirds,

254
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:51,290
which cancels out some factors and. Rearrange

255
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:57,020
things to have the remaining arbitrary constancy

256
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:04,010
in that with this. Remaining power leads by two

257
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,600
thirds in addition to the one of people out front.

258
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,260
This.

259
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,330
See times minus two thirds. Bill is still the

260
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,040
temperature and overall, we then find that the

261
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,420
pressure for an ideal gas is the number of

262
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,430
chemicals times the temperature divided by the

263
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:32,710
volume of gas, which, if we multiply through by

264
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,120
the volume, gives us a famous expression of is the

265
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,260
ideal gas law. It says that for ideal gas, the

266
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,820
product of the pressure and the volume is equal to

267
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,450
the product of the number of times the temperature.

268
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:59,570
And. This ideal gas law, if you check out some of

269
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,580
the textbooks that were referenced just at the

270
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,330
very beginning of the course, you will sometimes

271
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,610
see this introduced as the definition of the ideal

272
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,450
gas. An ideal gas is any substance that obeys

273
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,200
small. We've taken the opposite approach started

274
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,580
from microstates, the macroeconomic side, like

275
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,220
microscopic dynamics of these systems and built up

276
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,340
to the equation state rather than going from the

277
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:34,090
top down. I realize I just referred to this as an

278
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,940
equation of the states without defining what

279
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,380
exactly that is.

280
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:46,950
So the ideal gas law is a relation between the

281
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,820
large scale properties of the system, the

282
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,380
macroscopic qualities of it, in this case, the

283
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,820
pressure, volume and temperature that the internal

284
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,510
energy we've also seen is directly related to the

285
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,340
temperature as another

286
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,560
large scale property of the system. So the states

287
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,300
that this is an equation of is really a way of

288
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,540
saying that it is a relation between these

289
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,780
macroscopic properties of the system. Which is

290
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,450
part of the reason I've been referring to

291
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,770
microstates throughout the module so far that the

292
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,260
state's been discussed here, are not the

293
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,900
individual microstates corresponding to the

294
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,340
disposition of all in degrees of freedom in the

295
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,410
canonical example? Rather, the.

296
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,230
Collection of large scale properties like pressure

297
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,120
building and temperature that define what's called

298
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,650
the thermodynamic stage or the macro stage of the

299
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,150
system.

300
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,240
So.

301
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,160
Rather than depending on the detailed information

302
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,070
about all of these all and degrees of freedom,

303
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,970
this macro state is characterized just by the

304
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,930
large scale behaviour of, in this case, the ideal

305
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,260
gas. And as such, historically at least.

306
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:29,030
The initial scientific explorations of gases,

307
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,030
fluids and systems in general were focused on

308
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,820
these Makarova states that could be observed and

309
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,820
manipulated with the kind of technology that

310
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:43,910
existed hundreds of years ago. So historically,

311
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,260
those sorts of experimentations of systems of

312
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,080
gases, fluids with well-defined volumes,

313
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,000
temperatures and pressures were studied well

314
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,960
before the mathematical development of statistical

315
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,530
physics,

316
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,200
the famous example being all the way back before

317
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,060
in the sixteen hundreds. The physicist Robert

318
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:15,890
Boyle experimented with changing the temperature

319
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,240
of a gas station to the pressure on the gas to its

320
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:24,920
temperature fixed and measuring the volume that

321
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,610
resulted from that. An experiment that could be

322
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:33,530
done in the sixteen hundreds in finding a relation

323
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,520
between the pressure he was using as a control

324
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,590
parameter in those experiments and the volume he

325
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,840
was measuring and finding that those two

326
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,630
quantities were inversely related to each other,

327
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,690
or in other words, that their product was

328
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,550
constants so long as the temperature of the gas

329
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,310
under consideration was also constant, which

330
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,990
started from the ideal gas law. We can see is. A

331
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,650
direct consequence, though, as this came first,

332
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,650
historically, it became known as Boyle's law, at

333
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:14,200
least in England and France, and share his name

334
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,570
with a French physicist. I did similar things

335
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,910
about 20 years later. And.

336
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:29,420
Building on the sort of. Observation,

337
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,760
observational discovery that the pressure and

338
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,880
volume related in this way, more than one hundred

339
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,020
years later, various other relations between the

340
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:45,470
properties of. Thermodynamic states of gases were.

341
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,170
Discovered in the late seventeen hundreds of early,

342
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:54,690
eighteen hundreds. For instance, all of which not

343
00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:00,720
named after subsets of the scientists who were

344
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,390
exploring these ideas at the time. So, for

345
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:07,230
instance, holding the pressure constant and

346
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,890
varying the temperature of the gas, and scientists

347
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,620
were able to measure again that the. The volume

348
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,680
varied in this case proportional to the

349
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,800
temperature. In other words, the ratio of the

350
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:28,030
resulting volume with the varying temperature was

351
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:33,450
itself a constant. Which is another aspect of the

352
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,930
ideal gas law and turning this on its side and

353
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,950
fixing the volume, looking at the pressure and the

354
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,960
temperature, gave a completely analogous direct

355
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,900
relationship between pressure that was measured

356
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,690
and the temperature that was put in to the ratio

357
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,510
itself was a different color since the volume

358
00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:02,330
fixed. And this last one here. Oh, God, no. We've

359
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:07,620
already seen looked at. How the number of

360
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,220
particles in a gas could change at constant

361
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,510
pressure and constant temperature, depending on

362
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:21,270
the volume and obviously related to coming up with

363
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:26,910
the. Number two hundred twenty three of particles

364
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:31,960
in everyday substances. And based on all of these

365
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,720
violations that were being discovered over this

366
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,550
time period without necessarily knowing

367
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,520
mathematically where they came from at the

368
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,580
underlying level. It was possible to combine all

369
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,000
of them into the ideal gas law, which was done in

370
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,210
the 18 years, that was the empirical statement of

371
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,560
the ideal gas law as instead of relations, that

372
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,880
gases were observed to behave without necessarily

373
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,740
knowing why. In a few decades after that, in the

374
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,990
middle of the eighteen hundreds, there were

375
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:13,110
independents derivations showing how physical

376
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,970
physics could.

377
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,340
Produce all of these different religions and in

378
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,400
particular produce the ideal gas itself along the

379
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,300
lines that we've seen in the past. In the past

380
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,670
week. So there are two

381
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,090
lessons, two to say about this sort of historical

382
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:38,780
development.

383
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,080
First, being that there was a.

384
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,860
Tight connection between a lot of these

385
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,670
experimentations in the sort of idealized behavior

386
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,480
of gases as an abstract question and the kinds of

387
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,150
industrial engineering and.

388
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,100
It's called.

389
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,570
Industrial developments, including designing

390
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,630
engines and machines like that, was happening at

391
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,200
the same time with a more practical focus, trying

392
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:26,090
to build new machines to. On. To do work in

393
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,670
different ways is part of the industrial

394
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:33,530
revolution, so a dialogue between sort of pure

395
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:37,070
mathematical understanding of the physics

396
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:41,970
underlying. The systems that play really

397
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,510
contributed to and benefited from all of the

398
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,190
experimentation and exploration being done in the

399
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:56,390
engineering side of. Industrial development in the

400
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:01,790
Industrial Revolution. The other. Aspect of this

401
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,360
to emphasize is that the 18 50 is the derivation

402
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,290
of the Gastar from ideas of statistical physics

403
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:15,590
was really the start. Get kicked off a long

404
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,350
running debate about the extent to which the

405
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,820
statistical physics, the idea that. We can

406
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,150
understand the behavior of substances because they

407
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,580
are built up of a large number of atoms and

408
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,490
molecules that debates covid starts through this,

409
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,030
this result in particular the results of research

410
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,840
showing that making that assumption or

411
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,460
hypothesized. That atoms and molecules were at the

412
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:48,540
basis of gases and and other substances could

413
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:53,300
reproduce the ideal gas law, but it didn't resolve

414
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,580
the debate about whether those atoms and molecules

415
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,280
really existed, which kept running throughout all

416
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:04,170
of Boltzmann's career and up to and beyond. The

417
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,210
demonstration started with how Brownian motion can

418
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:15,350
result from statistical physics. On the situation,

419
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,170
following the development of the ideal gas on the

420
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,800
leader, eighteen hundreds was a bit analogous to

421
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,720
the situation string theory that I mentioned in

422
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:29,930
our first class meeting, where we know in

423
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,060
principle, at least these days, that string theory

424
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,440
can describe the new laws of physics, both general

425
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,310
relativity and quantum mechanics. But it's unknown

426
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,260
whether it's the only way to do so and how

427
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:47,400
seriously we should take the idea. That everything

428
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,800
we see is really made out of these fundamental

429
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,490
strands at a extremely microscopic level. There

430
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:57,080
may be other explanations that have been being

431
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,570
considered, and that would seem and that's

432
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:04,050
analogous to the arguments going on one hundred

433
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,990
and fifty years ago about the existence of atoms

434
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,960
and molecules and whether they are truly

435
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,950
responsible for the large scale macroscopic

436
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:21,780
behavior. Of gases and other other substances. So

437
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,650
that is that's a bit of a extended commentary from

438
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:30,840
me and also the end of the unit for introducing

439
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:36,030
ideal gases and before diving into the next unit,

440
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:41,280
which. He's going to use these IP addresses to. To

441
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,270
do work engines or cool substances in

442
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,180
refrigerators, apologists for a minute and ask if

443
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,710
there are any questions about any of the ideal gas.

444
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:00,480
Fundamentals that we've gone through over the past

445
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,010
week from the volume dependent energy levels to

446
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,690
this definition of the pressure and the ideal gas

447
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,030
more.

448
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,000
So it sounds like we are content to move on the

449
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,760
phone and in cycles, which will start by. Putting

450
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,720
the pressure was just introduced on a more

451
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,910
familiar framework, since I'm assuming. You see,

452
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,820
the previous modules were familiar in everyday

453
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,720
life, the intuitive connection between the

454
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:54,910
pressure and force and the connection between

455
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:00,940
pressure and work coming through force and some of

456
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:05,430
the classical Newton's laws of motion from those

457
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,130
from the 16 hundreds where these concepts were

458
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:16,320
being developed. So the. The definition of

459
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,130
pressure, which is just an earlier today as

460
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:25,260
isotropic response in the internal energy to a

461
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,640
change in the volume is not obviously related to

462
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,590
to doing work. I did. Talk about squeezing a

463
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,790
balloon into a box is an idea.

464
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,000
Connecting the pressure to a change in volume,

465
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,410
sort of a force on the volume of the system to

466
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,240
change it thereby.

467
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:55,850
Extracts pressure. And what we can do to make this

468
00:34:55,850 --> 00:35:01,160
connection a bit more explicit is by stepping back

469
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,670
to just considering rather than a full statistical

470
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,150
ensemble, just a single object at some position in

471
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,220
three dimensional space, some latitude, longitude

472
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:18,950
and altitude that some force acts upon at that

473
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:24,680
same position. And the the work done by this force.

474
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:31,740
Is a definition you may well have seen before, it

475
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:37,920
is how much? The energy changes due to that force.

476
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:46,650
Directed along the displacement of the object, you

477
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:53,300
mentioned some. Trajectory of an object moving

478
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,690
through. Three dimensional space and we exerts a

479
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:04,180
force on it. At some point in that trajectory and

480
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:09,980
the a product of that force in the position. Is

481
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,350
going to produce a change in the energy. Of the

482
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,500
object that is defined as the work, that's the

483
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,050
infinitesimal definition of the word which

484
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,610
generalizes to a light integral to the trajectory

485
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:28,980
of the object. Of the other product of the force

486
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,190
and cell times, the resulting displacement.

487
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,370
So just to give you an example, to check that this

488
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:43,020
all works out, we can start with this object at

489
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,280
some height above the ground, let it be stationary

490
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,480
to start with, and then drop it and let it fall

491
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,490
under the force of the Earth's gravity. Which is

492
00:36:55,490 --> 00:37:01,820
just directed downward, the Z direction, so zero

493
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,930
in the X and Y components and the negative,

494
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,130
sometimes G in Z components, the negative side

495
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,310
indicating downward force as opposed to upward the

496
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:17,180
masking, the mass of the object and the mass of

497
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,520
the object. And this. Given the strength of

498
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,860
gravity near the surface of the earth, nine point

499
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,960
eight meters per second squared.

500
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,420
With the initial kinetic energy of this object

501
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,860
being zero starting from rest. As the object falls

502
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:43,140
downward parallel to the south, the work that is

503
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,070
done on it is going to. Increase in temperature of

504
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,410
some.

505
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,780
Kinetic energy that upon hitting the ground,

506
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:57,910
starting from a height H. Is going to come from

507
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:03,310
this line integral, introduced to both the force

508
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,370
and the displacements in this case in parallel, so

509
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,080
the entire product becomes a simple product. You

510
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:15,740
have minus M.G. as the. That component of the

511
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,470
force and then you have to integrate over the

512
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,540
vertical distance that the object falls is

513
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,500
integrating from its initial height H down to zero,

514
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,040
the ground zero, which is minus H. Your product,

515
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,700
then, is the best times, three gravity times the

516
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:40,520
initial height. And if we. Plug that into the

517
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,030
expression for the work as a change in the energy

518
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,390
from its initial value of zero. We find that the

519
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,370
final energy of the object is just energy age,

520
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:57,890
which we can relate to the momentum of the object.

521
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,410
Again, the only non-zero component is that

522
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,850
subcomponent. And rearranging find that the

523
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,940
momentum is direct, a downward portion of the mass

524
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,450
times, the square root of two times the initial

525
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,750
height. So the classic result of classical

526
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:22,900
mechanics that connects to the idea of work as a

527
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:29,010
force in the project to change its energy. Now, we

528
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,010
want to generalize this to statistical physics, we

529
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:35,970
have some number, a large number of objects in a

530
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,900
statistical ensemble of specialized. We'll be

531
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,970
talking about the economic ensemble still and

532
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,660
specifically ideal gases and particles in the

533
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,740
canonical ensemble.

534
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:54,350
So we define the work done by a force. To me, the

535
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,950
change in the internal energy of the system that

536
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,480
drives quality, that is specifically due to that

537
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,430
force and the way we will tell in general whether

538
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,940
a change in energy is due to a force or not is

539
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,090
precisely through that connection to the volume.

540
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,840
It's going to be the volume of the gas that is the

541
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,230
control parameter being changed by the application

542
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:27,200
of the force and doing a similar. Simple

543
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,810
calculation to the case of that single falling

544
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,260
object we can consider.

545
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,660
This settlement covid from one of the references

546
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:46,060
in the lecture notes where we have. A of gas and

547
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,480
some fixed temperature with some fixed number of

548
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,220
particles in the system with some initial volume.

549
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:59,370
And we imagine that one side. Out of the box to

550
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:04,230
find it, this boy is a movable piston that has a

551
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:10,020
surface area any and by acting on this piston with

552
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,560
some force, we're able to push it into the box,

553
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,080
decreasing the volume by that surface area, times

554
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,230
the displacement of the Pistons and try to exit

555
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:26,060
the change in volume. Is the surface area of the

556
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,810
boom times, the amount it moves, the negative sign,

557
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:36,980
reflecting that the volume is decreasing? Well, I

558
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:43,250
think I just said out loud all of the words here,

559
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,810
except for the condition that change in volume, we

560
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:51,260
can demand that this process does not change the

561
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,400
entropy of the gas.

562
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:58,710
And that allows us to connect this process, this

563
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,340
force in the work done by it, to the pressure that

564
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,430
we defined earlier today, the end of unit for.

565
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,180
Where there will be some change in the energy due

566
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,260
to the decrease in the valadier with a fixed

567
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,800
entropy and that change. In the energy is due to

568
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,900
the force that we have applied to change that

569
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:30,620
volume and is therefore the work. That's. You're

570
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:33,280
defined to be the change, the energy due to an

571
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,180
external force.

572
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:41,020
Set that aside for now, looking at the.

573
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,050
Product of the sports times, the displacement of

574
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:51,410
the piston that it causes. We can relate the. Work

575
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,440
the force, which depends on the displacements,

576
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:01,480
then also appears in the change in the volume. So

577
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,100
replacing this. Differential expression with the

578
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,770
overall change in energy and the overall change in

579
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:12,730
volume, both of those dependent. On the

580
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:16,060
displacement of the piston, and we end up with the

581
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,850
pressure being identified with the force per unit

582
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:23,800
area that is exerted on the system to change the

583
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,770
volume of our gas, which is essentially

584
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:35,020
reproducing. The. Classical definition of pressure

585
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:40,150
as a force divided over some univariate. And if we

586
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,160
rearrange this equation. Fifty seven. We can

587
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:49,110
express the work in terms of the pressure and

588
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:53,040
change the volume, so taking this intermediate.

589
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:59,860
Expression. That depends on those general

590
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,110
qualities multiplied through by the change in

591
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,380
volume. You see that if we demand constant entropy,

592
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:11,840
we have the work as the change in internal energy

593
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:15,740
equal to the negative of the pressure times and

594
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,760
change the bottom. That negative side, we can

595
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,940
check all this sticky back to the example we just

596
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,450
did, changing the hour, decreasing the border

597
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:30,600
specifically. So a negative change avoiding. It's

598
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:34,330
something that we have a sense it's going to

599
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:39,100
require pushing on a in meeting resistance and

600
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:43,900
putting energy to work into the ideal gas that we

601
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:50,060
are considering. In the south. So that is the way

602
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,490
to remember the presence of this negative sign.

603
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,780
And this relation, in fact, holds even when the

604
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,310
entropy is allowed to change, so this expression

605
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:09,870
generalizes, the work is always going to be. Equal

606
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:12,680
to the negative pressure times, changing the world

607
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:19,720
in general, but in the case of. A process that is

608
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,950
not isotropic would the entropy is allowed to

609
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:28,390
change, it will no longer be guaranteed that this

610
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:32,560
change of is the only way that the energy can

611
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,710
change, that there will be other contributions to.

612
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:43,490
The internal energy of the gas that are not coming

613
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,030
from the force that is being imposed change the

614
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:51,770
volume and therefore not part of the work as we to

615
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:52,370
it.

616
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,890
And thinking at the time will make a couple last

617
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:05,140
comments for today, first that in.

618
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,220
The next few sections, so starting tomorrow, we're

619
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:15,170
going to be interested in using the gas to do work

620
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:20,210
on its surroundings so there's extra burdens. So

621
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,000
rather than thinking about us pushing on the

622
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,560
piston to do work on a gas and increase its

623
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:28,790
internal energy, we're going to want to talk about

624
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:34,130
using the energy that is in that gas to somehow be

625
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:38,470
harnessed and do work. Surroundings are driving a

626
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,940
truck that can turn into a new video or perhaps

627
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:48,940
coupling that to an axle that will allow a car to

628
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,830
to drive, move forward or backward. And in the

629
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,410
case where we have the gas that's doing and its

630
00:46:55,410 --> 00:47:00,360
surroundings, the change in internal energy is

631
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,300
going to be negative, that work is going to be

632
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,990
negative. We would want to see positive change in

633
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,450
the volume, but we're going to have to give pretty

634
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:12,060
careful track of the negative signs which

635
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:16,580
distinguish between whether. This gas in our

636
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,850
system is too important and its surroundings where

637
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:21,440
the work is being done to that gas.

638
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:28,310
Finally, if we recall the ideal gas law in the.

639
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:36,180
With the pressure. May well depend on the volume

640
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,690
and temperature, so that is an expression for

641
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,750
pressure we provide for an ideal guest here today.

642
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:47,040
As we make this change in volume, we can expect

643
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,780
the pressure to change as well. So. More generally,

644
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:59,570
if we always fix the particle no and consider a

645
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:04,870
change. In the volume to extract the work, we will

646
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:08,380
have to not just multiply the constant pressure

647
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,660
times somehow to change the body, but actually

648
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:15,520
integrate over the infinitesimal changes of volume

649
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:20,080
that each lead to a corresponding response in the

650
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:24,460
pressure, integrating from some initial warming to

651
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:29,380
a final volume that integral of pressure times,

652
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,070
the volume differential is going to give the

653
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:37,480
overall work of that process. So that is a good

654
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:42,040
place to start for now to cope with heat as

655
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,340
another way of changing energy tomorrow morning.

656
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:50,550
Are there any final questions before? Wrap up for

657
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,080
today.

658
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,790
If not, I will start shooting things down here.

659
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:06,290
Move over to my office hours in case any questions

660
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:09,740
about the homework due Thursday. And if I don't

661
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,710
see you there, I'll see you back in the other room

662
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,110
tomorrow morning.

663
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,010
What

664
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,580
role?

665
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:36,660
So.
