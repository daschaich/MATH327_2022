1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,730
Should now be underway, just a minute late, as there

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,630
was another round of technical difficulties with the printers.

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,390
Hopefully I have successfully transferred the

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,480
six digits for this afternoon's session.

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,240
Seven, six, six, seven, five

6
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:37,770
three.  So with that out of the way, welcome back to the Friday

7
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:45,340
afternoon.  It's become sunny and warm but there are still some

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,790
fun things we can do here.

9
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:54,820
So.

10
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,660
This week's tutorial, we talked about Sterling's

11
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,610
formula, which will need some focus adjustment.

12
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,510
How did you all get on with that?

13
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,570
With Sterling. And before me that she's named.

14
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,880
You want to part of.

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:43,950
The.

16
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,780
Derivations in this problem, my last week in

17
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,230
particular, driving these bounds, we were able to

18
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:59,280
do it in person last time. Do you have any. Going

19
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,080
beyond that to. Find that. Do you buy that or what

20
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,130
the values of any of these? As yet, unknown

21
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,020
consequences may be received in this full series

22
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:21,800
for the vectorial of a large number of workers,

23
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,770
only it's logarithm.

24
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,180
That's true of.

25
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,610
Too challenging, especially, he says, since I left,

26
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:47,450
it is optional war analysis and the. Version of

27
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,510
this problem that I initially uploaded to Canibus,

28
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,390
which I've since fixed a few typos in there,

29
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,650
including at the bottom of the page here. This is

30
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,340
of the power. Negative one was incorrectly.

31
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,700
Sean, the initial version as negative a switch is.

32
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,110
Fairly obviously incorrect. You make you change

33
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,360
your variables to Y equals eight times X and then

34
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,080
just do the integral to the minus Y y.

35
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,570
Something something's important to society for

36
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,170
potential.

37
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,930
It's.

38
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,140
Here, so would it be worth going through some of

39
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,340
these steps that we didn't get to last time around

40
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,420
in driving?

41
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,960
Sterling approximation and powers used to allow.

42
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,290
There does seem to be. Objection, saying that

43
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,160
you've only done this work on your own. Is it time

44
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,700
to repeat it, live here to pick up with the.

45
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,970
Equation at the bottom of this page where there

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,820
was an unfortunate typo that. In the initial

47
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,160
version of the fix would have. Caused some.

48
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,450
Difficulties with manipulating this equation.

49
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:12,790
The idea of the manipulation to do here, so taking

50
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,170
it for granted that we've shown these vials and

51
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,500
confirmed that the meeting turned into an

52
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,870
approximation, is a walk in.

53
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,400
In order to derive the full expression with the

54
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,190
facts or to plan included, we need to.

55
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,350
Stop what is about to start looking at the actual

56
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,600
calculation of N factorial, which. I'm sure you've

57
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,450
seen can be related to the Scherba function, that

58
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:52,380
is. Further generalizable to complex numbers

59
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,270
related to rebudget, a function, the first step is

60
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,730
to. Consider just interest for any particular

61
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,270
positive.

62
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,100
Ensure that the game of function plus one is equal

63
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:17,340
to N factorial in the. Trick suggested here was

64
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,850
manipulating this simple, definite integral.

65
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,860
Integrating from. Zero to infinity, minus eight

66
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,050
times X is one over a year, and the manipulation

67
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:39,730
that. Proves productive in this context is to take

68
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:45,560
the. Derivative with respect to a of both sides of

69
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:53,270
that equation. So. If we do that on the left hand

70
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,570
side derivative with respect to a interchanging

71
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,020
freely with the integration over X brings down a

72
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,470
factor of minus X plus the exponential on the

73
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,120
right hand side, that the derivative turns that a

74
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,090
B minus one into one over A squared again with a

75
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:17,780
negative side that we could cancel out. And then

76
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,730
repeating this process in the second derivative of

77
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,150
the derivative of the first derivative, we bring

78
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:32,300
down another power minus X on the right hand side

79
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,600
of our minus to the negative signs. Keep canceling

80
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,710
out on each side of these equations. And if we

81
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,300
generalize to the tenth derivative, so.

82
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,650
And derivatives, with respect to a gives us the

83
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,760
relation between the integral role that we play

84
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:02,090
off with the gamma function and plus one. And just

85
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,750
the product of all the powers that come down on

86
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,170
the right hand side of that vectorial times, this

87
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,370
arbitrary, constant day to the power minus and

88
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,500
plus one of eight to one, it drops out and we end

89
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,370
up with what we wanted. Now.

90
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,250
That's just the first step in the actual

91
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,770
derivation of Serling's formula, the next one

92
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,870
being to.

93
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,190
Stipulates this interval for the gamma function in

94
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:52,080
particular, looking at it back up here. Trying to

95
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:58,380
expand this 50 grand in some sensible way, so I

96
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,080
showed the picture last time arguing that. This

97
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,530
function is approximately a gorshin. Around its

98
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,320
maximum value, you can see that if.

99
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,390
The X is very large or very small, that

100
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:23,230
exponential factor is going to dominate the

101
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:28,020
overall integrated and I guess the the next step,

102
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,480
it was just that I can't remember if we discussed

103
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,310
or not getting to the second page. I was to show

104
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,970
that this factor in the category in which we can

105
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:46,390
revive as a single exponential has its maximum and

106
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,080
a particular value, which is just a matter of

107
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,200
taking derivatives of that integrated. So.

108
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,140
This overlay of some calculations taking that

109
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,140
derivative of the A. we have two terms that we

110
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,080
want to set equal to zero to exercise this

111
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,170
function. And cancelling out come back would be by

112
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,950
the sex those two terms and end up being taxed on

113
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:23,760
our in from the derivative of the sex and times

114
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,030
extra power and minus one procedure at the end,

115
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,000
which immediately implies that An equals X at this

116
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,720
extreme second derivative is just as easy to

117
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:42,290
compute and evaluate against at the extreme gives

118
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,370
a negative result after several cancellations.

119
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:52,510
Which confirms that extreme that we have is indeed

120
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,900
a maximum, which is not a surprise, and we looked

121
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,920
at the plot of that function last time around. And

122
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,740
this justifies expanding the war, rewriting the

123
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,970
Interbrand in terms of fluctuations around this

124
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:16,460
maximum. So at the maximum when X equals and this

125
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,960
new variable Y equals zero and small Y is going to

126
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,400
correspond to the small region around the maximum,

127
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,700
that actually contributes to the integral going

128
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,970
over the integrating over this exponentially

129
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:38,960
suppressed function. So we can approximate. In

130
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,770
fact, we know very well by expanding. It's

131
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:48,180
exponential in terms of and so why small compared

132
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,770
to an.

133
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:57,330
Itself involves first expanding the water that is

134
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,830
within the exponential.

135
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,490
Which. We can.

136
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,950
Do you think the usual power series, logarithm of

137
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,230
one plus a small number is small number itself,

138
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,590
minus the number squared two and so on?

139
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:31,430
Off the screen. X-Men is next to two plus executed

140
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,980
over three positive signs off to infinity. That

141
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:41,520
gives us some cancellations and a suspicious

142
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,860
looking and again, bias. And it's already

143
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,310
reminiscent of Sterling's formula trying to drive

144
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,090
what's left over after that truncated expansion of

145
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,250
the order of the small number Kud Y squared away

146
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,470
over in one of the accused. We can insert all of

147
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:07,480
this back into that exponential. And bring out the

148
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:12,530
cost in terms of why. So that's the more than my

149
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,340
spin is at the end of the end, minus 10 in what's

150
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,870
left of the. Integral is precisely what was

151
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,730
promised in the.

152
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,030
Problems with that last time. Which is that factor

153
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:38,310
is going to play in that. Gives us the usual form

154
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,580
of Stirling's formula that you may have seen

155
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,030
before.

156
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,670
So hopefully walking through those steps pretty

157
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,550
quickly out of the. What's going through the

158
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,380
argument here is a decent balance between filling

159
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,990
in and sticking points that you might encounter

160
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:06,070
thinking about this on the or at the same time not

161
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,270
duplicating that effort that you put it on your

162
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:17,260
own. The generalization that I'm still exposed to

163
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:25,440
this whole series, these corporations A, B and C

164
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,600
suppressed by larger and larger powers, is

165
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,270
something a little less. Carmen. This is something

166
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,990
you may not actually have seen before. It sounded

167
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,390
like.

168
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:48,030
You weren't able to find any candidates for the

169
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,700
values of those A, B and C that. Correct. And you

170
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,720
have a. Result. They want to shut up.

171
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,530
In the interest of time, I'll go through this

172
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,750
stage of the.

173
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,310
The calculation is a little more quickly. It's a

174
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,810
fun one, and there was the last time that having

175
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,990
derived this usual form of service for the to play

176
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,260
and times, this had to be a factor. We can take

177
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,220
that is taken as given. That's the approximation

178
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,980
can be expressed in this form of an infinite

179
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:47,690
series. And apply that to the relation between, in

180
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,030
fact, where you live and plus one Vectorial that

181
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:55,160
is really you defining property of the factorial

182
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,710
as an operation, which is to say. Plus, one factor

183
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:05,390
is and plus one times in factorial and both of

184
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:10,400
these materials. They are on the screen now. We

185
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,380
can hit with.

186
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,620
For one, keeping some number of shows here up to

187
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,570
order one over into the fourth. So on the left

188
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,670
hand side of this equation, everything is in terms

189
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,800
of influence, one both in the prefecture and in

190
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,220
the series expansion itself. And on the right side,

191
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,260
we're expanding in factorial. We have that just

192
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,800
factors in except for that overall and plus one.

193
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,730
So a fairly straightforward arithmetic to do, to

194
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:54,050
isolate, say, those powers of one hundred and

195
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,290
whatever and squared one over and you won't get

196
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,740
all of the square roots and the exponential either

197
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,770
canceled out or what remains is this combination

198
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,470
of one plus one, the return to the power, then

199
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:18,020
from the terms in parentheses and plus the half

200
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,550
from the square roots. Celebrity players and so on,

201
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:30,050
and we have to do that is. Express both the series

202
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,750
in the square brackets, expanded in terms of one

203
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,470
over end plus one to some power in terms of.

204
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,310
Powers of one president and similarly for this

205
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:48,710
factor. That one plus one and two and a half. Also

206
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,700
needs to be expressed in terms of the powers of

207
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:59,090
whatever. You may recognize that.

208
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:09,460
Expression for the exponential. Is the limit of

209
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,780
them going to infinity? What I want to listen to

210
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,290
the end suggests that this is the latest one going

211
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:26,620
along here will be relevant. The first stage of

212
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,150
things is, you know, in terms of expanding the

213
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:36,370
powers of one over plus one. Law enforcement

214
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,420
squared law enforcement is just the simple

215
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,780
application of the geometric series pull out the

216
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,860
leading power of and in the denominator.

217
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,710
Everything left in the denominator is a small

218
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:55,390
number of one race versions of the series, and we

219
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,350
can expand. In this case, we have one plus one

220
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:04,070
over N so we're expanding in terms of negative

221
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,390
whatever and whatever squared minus here and so on

222
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,980
up to that same border, whatever into the fourth

223
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,430
at.

224
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:22,060
Here to the other side of that equation for the.

225
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,910
Other factor, one over one, plus whatever happened

226
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,350
to the power and plus a half. The.

227
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,650
Easy ways to address this is to, again, convert it

228
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,620
to the exponential of the law and do that same

229
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,640
sort of expansion that we did in the previous

230
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,070
derivation of the route, buy, in fact, to expand

231
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,800
the law that overhead is a small number. So here

232
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,260
I've kept up to order one over into the fourth,

233
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,560
which would keep into account that it's being

234
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,750
multiplied by a factor of power and from the

235
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,010
overall power front. And then just rearranging

236
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,030
gives us an exponential of a small number. And

237
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,430
actually, for any number of the we know is just.

238
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,190
It's so serious that we can truncate after the

239
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,670
first term up to this order, whatever, and to the

240
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,720
fourth. So bringing everything together, we have

241
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,480
both sides of this equality and plus one Vectorial

242
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,120
is a plus, one factorial. Both sides have ever

243
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,970
expressed in terms of how or whatever, and we just

244
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,150
have to match up all the coefficients of those

245
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:53,850
equal hours on each side of this equal sign. So

246
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:59,530
power one over zero, that's just one one times one

247
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,830
is one that equals one on the other side, which is

248
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:09,550
correct, but not so useful for determining the

249
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,800
coefficients of the series at the one over end

250
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,980
level. There's just this term here times that one

251
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,240
this term. They're telling us that it equals a

252
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,160
again, self-consistent but useless. But if we look

253
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,750
at the.

254
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,050
Four terms proportional to whatever and squared

255
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,230
have we have this one of the 12 times when we have

256
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,200
B minus A times one on the other side was just B,

257
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:49,560
which can only be true if that day is a 12. And

258
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,130
there's a similar. Rehearsal for the whatever and

259
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,880
human turns we're here, we need to account for

260
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:04,790
costumes. Including this eight over 12. In

261
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,890
addition to the terms of in. Whatever, and you'd

262
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:13,070
already multiply by one. Coming up, with

263
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:20,240
cancellations on both sides that may be equal to a

264
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,510
over 24 or two hundred eighty eight, so the

265
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:31,250
ultimate results for Sterling's formula is the.

266
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,450
Potentially familiar prefecture to high end times

267
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,960
and over all to our end times, these power

268
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,430
corrections one plus one over 12 and it's one over

269
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:48,140
two hundred eighty. And then the next trip is a

270
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,600
native son. I forget about you and to you. There's

271
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,290
a clear procedure to compute as many of these

272
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:03,060
terms as we want just by expanding. More Mexican

273
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,170
insurance to appropriate orders and matching the

274
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:10,310
powers of one over and that appear in the

275
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,580
definition of vectorial.

276
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,090
So hopefully that was

277
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:25,160
amazing, too, to see what might be more relevant,

278
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,520
the statistical physics than this derivation of a

279
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,030
classical formula is looking at applications of

280
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,010
Strongs formula and maybe addressing the question

281
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,810
of. Do those corrections that these computers

282
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,500
really matter?

283
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:45,510
We have

284
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:53,980
this expression for an vectorial. That's

285
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,260
expanding and plugging that into the logarithm

286
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,360
that is going to give us.

287
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:09,470
Expression usually stop with placidity sequence of

288
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,310
corrections.

289
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,170
When half offered to buy end and then the

290
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,010
logarithm of this whole series.

291
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,720
That can come into play.

292
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,340
And.

293
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,210
It's an easy enough exercise to fire a pipe down

294
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,960
and plug in numbers into both sides of this

295
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:45,900
equality. There is what I've done in this table,

296
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,190
just for some representative, the illustrations

297
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:55,320
that if we look at, say, just an equals five.

298
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,410
Two terms will we typically truncate statements

299
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:06,030
from what we've done so far, electrodes are off by

300
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:12,500
thirty five percent. So it gives us the right

301
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,410
order of magnitude, but this is the.

302
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,870
Direct computation by.

303
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,980
A significant amount, though, adding that next

304
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:33,250
correction, the. Close to one half of the

305
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,150
logarithm too tight end immediately gets us within

306
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,480
one percent of the correct result. And all of

307
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,160
these approximations become more accurate as the

308
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,380
number of degrees of freedom going into these

309
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:56,470
factorial increases. So. Already for any one

310
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:00,420
hundred homes is still tiny compared to 10 to the

311
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:05,130
power 20 30 that we have in all of this. It

312
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:09,520
becomes challenging to print out enough figures to

313
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,680
see any discrepancy between the result we've

314
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,850
computed and the direct computation. Even that, in

315
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:24,410
my mind, is in is 99 percent accurate. And if we

316
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:29,050
get that in that war, they're going to buy and

317
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,820
whatever and then and squared terms. In addition,

318
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,030
additional war in.

319
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:42,930
Then we get to the point where. The approximation,

320
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:47,160
especially the computation to what is said about

321
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:52,290
11 significant failures have to go out to one part

322
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,730
in the or tend to be 11 to find the difference

323
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,630
between the two.

324
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,890
Actually.

325
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:08,660
This hints at another use of Sterling's formula,

326
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,620
which I made.

327
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,910
Currently on.

328
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,280
Screen here, I'd be able to get set up before. We

329
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,390
started.

330
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,240
Look at the Python code that.

331
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:39,250
I used to read the numbers we've been looking at,

332
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:39,670
which.

333
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,110
Somewhere.

334
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,660
This for any five, you see that? Thirty six

335
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,440
percent off just from here, like I said, getting

336
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,790
better opportunity for several significant figures

337
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,770
matching as we get through the full computation.

338
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:11,700
But if we consider, say, seven equals five

339
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,490
of.

340
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,590
So two thousand and ten to three

341
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,490
million. See this code breaking down, it's not

342
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,340
really a complicated code, it's just plugging in

343
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,940
these formulas and evaluating them for

344
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:38,600
given end of interest. Forty four thousand the.

345
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,850
Python computation of the log of and factorial

346
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,330
precedes by first trying to compute the factorial

347
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,840
head and then trying to take the log of it, but

348
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,290
already for the second end of

349
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,640
the keyboard,

350
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,550
already for kind of one hundred and seventy one, I

351
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,400
think is where that factorial.

352
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:17,590
Overflows the available floating point numbers

353
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,530
that are available that are offered by modern

354
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:24,520
computers, so one hundred seventy degrees of

355
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,840
freedom in this vectorial is about the upper limit.

356
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,700
We can handle about 10 to power. Three hundred

357
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,160
seven.

358
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:39,190
Whereas just the simple expressions that we have

359
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:43,090
from Sterling's formula, I have no problem.

360
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,950
Computing numbers as large as 10 of the 10 under

361
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,910
the 12 at some points will be roundoff effects in

362
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,480
and of itself that even though and factorial, is

363
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:04,730
unmanageable without some special care. The

364
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:09,230
Serling's formula approximation, the computation

365
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:15,650
of Morgan Vectorial flows through without any

366
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,700
particular challenge.

367
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,480
All their applications. I don't want to spend the.

368
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,920
Full time on this. To

369
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,940
do one other discussion, going back to Unit two,

370
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:44,240
that's introducing the microeconomic ensemble and

371
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,560
in particular the entropy, in this case for a STEM

372
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,750
system, which is a direct computations of the

373
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,690
entropy would be if the external magnetic field

374
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,980
were zero and every single one of the two of the

375
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,570
power and possible microstates were accessible

376
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:10,070
with the same sort of energy in the approach in

377
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:14,770
the. From that considered how that would change if

378
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,310
we demanded that the energy remain zero in the

379
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,660
presence of a magnetic field and we found that the

380
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:28,630
resulting entropy was the logarithm of twice the

381
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,800
number of quite experienced, minus twice the

382
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,570
amount of. Of that number of people with

383
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,400
experience, actually, and we've been told they're

384
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,350
going to try to computers back to where it was

385
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,920
instead, just try plugging in some numbers, for

386
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:50,280
example, with eight spin's seeing that the entropy

387
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,600
decreased from the log to the eight two hundred

388
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,060
fifty six down to seventy.

389
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,860
Now, if we try to hit this with try to address

390
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,800
this with Stirling's or what.

391
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,550
That gives us a way to approximate these facts,

392
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,690
horribles that we

393
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:24,480
saw. Sorry about that

394
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:31,020
the former cop tried to grab.

395
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:40,720
So in this case, we have and is equal to twice the

396
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:49,110
number of opportunities to be paid. Interest. In

397
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:54,120
this case is going to be the one with them of the

398
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,440
binomial factor for, say, two and choose evidence

399
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,730
which.

400
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,050
Did that computation already on this page, still

401
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,890
more than two, eventually minus twice Walkerville

402
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,830
factorial, which are usually a function of

403
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:22,010
Stirling's formula, would give us to and more to

404
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:28,550
end minus two in. I was twice and once again I was

405
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:35,140
in, so. Although the linear terms cancel minus two,

406
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,980
plus two, and indeed, if we break up this

407
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:43,180
logarithm to allow them to a with them than the

408
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:48,640
two and log and cancel the two and log in and we

409
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:55,390
are left with. To end times, the one or two, which

410
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,390
is exactly what we found.

411
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:09,960
Or the case where that sort of genetic field was

412
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,470
equal to zero. So this is a case where our usual

413
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:19,580
approximation to Sterling's formula is a bit too

414
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,460
overaggressive and doesn't distinguish between the

415
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,520
doesn't reveal the decrease in entropy that we can

416
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,110
expect from removing a large fraction of

417
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:35,650
microstates from the accessible set. What we need

418
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:42,460
to do in this case is retain that logarithmic term,

419
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:46,690
at least take that out here to keep from having to

420
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,490
stretch it out while I talk. So we have all of the

421
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:55,450
cancellations we just went through at that to add

422
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,600
more to that. In addition to that, the moderate

423
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:03,980
level. We have the lawn of the square root of two

424
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:09,060
pipelines to N minus the minus twice the water in

425
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,680
that square root, which is water to paint itself

426
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,820
combining those lines out. The two and four, we

427
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,600
end up with the decrease in entropy that we

428
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,520
expected rather than that for two and to for the

429
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,550
case of all microstates of the spin system that

430
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,370
decreases by the logarithm of the square root of

431
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:41,530
pipelines. And so the direct calculation for this

432
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:46,780
to end equals date back to. That gave us the more

433
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,030
70 that's now being approximated by eight ball to

434
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,960
minus the lawn of the square root of four, which

435
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,020
is again within one percent of the true value.

436
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,530
So in addition to confirming that the entropy is

437
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,460
decreasing, that negative sign is microstates are

438
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:16,800
made inaccessible. We have a precise prediction

439
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,880
for exactly how much it computes, which require

440
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,240
that.

441
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,760
Third. Term in the Sterlings formula for the. And

442
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,420
there's lots of other fun things that could be

443
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,160
done with Sterling's formula. One example is to go

444
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,020
back to the vandervoort in one dimension to big

445
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:46,080
step sizes that would consider in the one where

446
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:50,640
you can show that as the number of steps in the

447
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,800
walk increases to infinity, the probability that

448
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,170
the water returns would start a position

449
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:03,390
infinitely many times is one hundred percent. And

450
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,710
that follows from following Sterling's formula to

451
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,010
some of the combinatorial factors that it was in

452
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,860
that calculation. The same thing holds true in two

453
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,590
dimensions. Where the random walk with the big

454
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:22,400
step, like their response to choosing a direction

455
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,310
down, left or right during the step in that

456
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:31,730
direction. Which defines a let's call lattice

457
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:36,630
positions that the marker can can be held, so

458
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,560
rather than doing just left and right with even

459
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,780
sized steps. It's also possible to go up or down.

460
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,980
And in this case as well. So all the spaces in

461
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,130
there are meant to be equally spaced. And the fact

462
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,260
that they're now deceased have to my artistic

463
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,190
abilities also in this case, there is a 100

464
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,630
percent probability that the walker will return to

465
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,240
the starting position infinitely many times as it

466
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,250
takes steps to realize the three dimensions, that

467
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,950
same probability changes from one hundred percent

468
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:19,440
to zero percent. And that is also the result in

469
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,440
all higher numbers of dimensions. We imagine the

470
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,590
threat of water exploring some. Higher dimensional

471
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:35,370
levels, possibly in an abstract space of points

472
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,180
rather than physical space. There is a sharp

473
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,050
change from one or two dimensions to free and

474
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,790
higher in terms of.

475
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,720
How possible is it possible for Walker to return

476
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,510
to the starting place and how frequently does that

477
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:03,040
I will stop going on about Sterling's formula with

478
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,670
that? We still have a few minutes remaining, I

479
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:11,410
guess some discussion, at least with the homework

480
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:16,190
assignment that's now due in less than a week. And

481
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:20,260
just to comment on some of the questions that have

482
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,470
been posed here, some of the inquiries I've

483
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:29,350
received about that and see if any of you have any

484
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,290
further questions that would take a look at this

485
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:35,500
assignment or if you haven't looked at this, can

486
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:41,310
be a chance to. Go through it to some extent and

487
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:46,050
make sure that everything that is being asked is

488
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:46,970
clear.

489
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,960
So the question that came in had to do with this

490
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:01,480
first problem about the. Movement of oil spill and

491
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:08,310
in particular, the question about. Whether the.

492
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,940
The spill itself. Can be modeled as just a one

493
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:21,610
dimensional process, or if the larger spreading of

494
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:24,370
the spill on the surface of the water needed to be

495
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,080
taken into account. So.

496
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,720
In practice, if we. Imagine if some oil spill has

497
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,700
time. John, in addition to drifting, we might

498
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,680
expect that spill to spread out over a larger area

499
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:48,850
in not just the direction it's drifting, but. The

500
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:52,970
whole. Two dimensional plane available to earth on

501
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:56,440
the surface of the ocean. But essentially, what we

502
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,700
are doing in this problem is a simplification, and

503
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:06,080
this is projected over that drift in the final

504
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:13,100
direction just onto the single line. That

505
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:18,590
separates the location of the first from the.

506
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,310
Protected area that we are worried about reaching

507
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,950
and not just the Griffin diffusion of the spill.

508
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,390
Towards the protected area in that whole dimension,

509
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:37,370
this can't be justified a bit more precisely than.

510
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,100
By going through the problem just to.

511
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,940
Suppose that, well, it is an accurate

512
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,940
approximation of the. Before edge of this rift

513
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:56,500
remains parallel to the boundary of this marine

514
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:02,310
protected area in two dimensions. But we can't

515
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:06,060
take it as a given or as long as us that this is

516
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,850
the one dimensional problem, that.

517
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:19,290
Post for us to to deal with. And in this first

518
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:23,810
question. The many questions make it more

519
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,390
straightforward.

520
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,930
Looking at. Systems of the microeconomic ensemble

521
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:33,890
is.

522
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,910
Even from that microbiological behavior, the

523
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:46,310
temperatures entropies and the process of heat

524
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,670
exchange systems with various temperatures

525
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:53,070
according to triple contact with each other and

526
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,290
leave the last two questions actually touch on

527
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:01,700
reforecast in Unit three. So derivations and

528
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:06,500
elaborations left out of the lecture that was

529
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,270
driving the.

530
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,940
Fluctuation in response, relation between heat

531
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,670
capacity and the fluctuations of the energy around

532
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,650
its value, the canonical ensemble, and certainly

533
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,350
looking at the high and low temperature expansions

534
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,950
for the interval and the internal energy and the

535
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:33,820
entropy of a system of indistinguishable spins of

536
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,990
the gas, which is where we wrap up Unit three on

537
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:42,260
Monday. So. Are there?

538
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:49,390
Any aspects of these questions that are unclear

539
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:58,460
just needed to read into the balance and all

540
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:04,400
should be started at the athlete in terms of

541
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:11,560
religious? Yeah, so the specific terms that are

542
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,610
requested

543
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,240
is the screen.

544
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:22,060
In these expansions for the last two parts of

545
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,390
question four on this specific about how many

546
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:29,920
times to keep, so in this middle part of this, the

547
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,390
two leading troops, which may include any

548
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,010
volunteer constants, that does not depend on the

549
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,550
temperature, that can be one of the few of them.

550
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:45,810
And then. In the last part, there's just the one

551
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,940
leading term in high temperatures and two leading

552
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:55,390
terms, depending on whether we're in city that has

553
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:58,720
no plans to retire.

554
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:06,870
Yeah, so that is the small parameter that we will

555
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:11,460
be expanding in, depending on whether it's the low

556
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,260
or high temperature, it's being pursued. So that

557
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,130
is the small parameter that organizes what turns

558
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,820
into something. So just like we were doing today

559
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:26,680
in terms of hours of over and.

560
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:45,270
So I want. Go on to say anything more about that

561
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:47,730
assignment, if there aren't further questions

562
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:48,050
about.

563
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:54,020
Take a look at three things now or wrap up and

564
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,750
move on into the weekend and see how you get on

565
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,140
with that.
