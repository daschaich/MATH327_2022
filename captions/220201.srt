1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,800
Okay,

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,140
I'll keep doing both Zoom and Stream Capture

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,660
recordings to see which works best. Turns out the

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,710
ones yesterday didn't really work at all, but

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,590
fortunately that seems to be an issue with the

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,070
equipment in the other room 210 rather than. A

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,440
personal curse for me, this document actually

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,060
seems to be functioning the way it's supposed to

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,370
be recordings and in fact, the projection itself

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,870
should turn out better today than yesterday,

11
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,290
should be able to zoom in and out and even focus.

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:51,360
On what we are looking at in the magic number for

13
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,200
the. Flight attendants will check Second System

14
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:58,420
edition

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,230
this

16
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:05,870
year.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,200
So knowing that

18
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,720
and having just met at the end of yesterday, you

19
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,410
get at the beginning of today, there's not need to

20
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,710
do too much recap. There's not enough time for

21
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:34,310
information have to fail. And there was one point

22
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,330
that there was one little tidbit that I actually

23
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,880
forgot to bring up and talk about at the beginning

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,370
of yesterday morning, what the motivation and the

25
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,460
big picture for statistical physics that actually

26
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,130
had to do with the Nobel Prizes that were awarded

27
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,200
just last autumn, which I don't know if any of you

28
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,150
kept track of that, but half the Nobel Prize went

29
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,420
to a couple folks, secure a bit of a class

30
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,720
Hofferman for work on climate modelling. And the

31
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,300
climate models are actually reliable, predictable,

32
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,970
which is one of the big applications of

33
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,680
statistical physics in modern day research with

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,450
some relevance to.

35
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,440
To society and to us and the other half of the

36
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,040
award actually went to a jury of your peers who.

37
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,790
Was awarded the Nobel Prize for conceptual

38
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,970
breakthroughs in the treatment of complex

39
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,970
statistical systems, in particular systems related

40
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,580
to the interactions that we'll be getting to

41
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,630
toward the latter end of the term. All of those

42
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,260
applications which are sufficiently cutting edge

43
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:57,570
to. The analysis by Nobel Prize are not going to

44
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:02,820
pop up in this class and that code two zero three

45
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,570
nine seven nine, which did not go.

46
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,230
The chat window.

47
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,020
I might be able to design some tutorial problem

48
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,780
once we get into those interactive systems that

49
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,290
will connect to some of the stuff, Super Easy was

50
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,390
working on things. These are called spin classes

51
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,140
that.

52
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,100
Rely on non negligible interactions, which is

53
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,370
exactly the opposite situation of the negligible

54
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,020
interactions. If you look at four for most of this

55
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:45,270
term, which is in in place of formal recap, just

56
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,910
that reminds us of the importance of statistical

57
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,200
physics and also its role in the emergence of

58
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,240
complex phenomena from fairly simple underlying

59
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,820
fundamental processes that we have to model

60
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,450
sarcastically with elements of probability. So

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,890
going from these individual atoms or other

62
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,340
molecules of the particles, objects in our system

63
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,710
that are bouncing off each other or even just

64
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,490
passing straight through each other. We come up

65
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:21,810
with the. Complex emergent behavior from a very

66
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,790
large number of those objects with 10 to the power,

67
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,840
20, 30 being the relevant number, Avogadro's

68
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,220
number appearing in sort of everyday scenarios,

69
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,040
everyday situations built on the underlying ADLs.

70
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,810
And we went through then a few formal definitions

71
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,170
to build up the probability of foundations. The

72
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,130
key one being what is the top of the screen here?

73
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,570
The introduction of measurements. That is a

74
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,950
mapping that to apply to the state of the universe

75
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,150
after some manipulation or some observation that

76
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,560
allows us to control the set of outcomes that we

77
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,720
are interested in. So when we roll the dice, the

78
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,940
measurements is what allows us to predict the

79
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,820
outcome of that. The stuff the goes onto the

80
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,850
numbers one through six, ignoring the situations

81
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,300
where the guy ends up on the stage in the corner

82
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,910
or a cat comes by the. And why can't we map out

83
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,850
the one to six? The measurement process takes into

84
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,310
account all of those possibilities and just gives

85
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,840
us a number that we can work with and treat as an

86
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,530
event, some subset of all of those possible

87
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,860
outcomes that the measurement defines. And we got

88
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:56,280
to at the end of yesterday, the the mapping. Of

89
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,670
events in this event space, the set of all

90
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,330
possible events from the subset of outcomes into

91
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,740
the real numbers between zero and one, including,

92
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,920
of course, the probabilities of those events occur

93
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,980
from zero percent up to one hundred percent. And

94
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,400
yes, the question came out, how much measure

95
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,520
theory is it relevant to this definition? And

96
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,770
really there are the two properties coming right

97
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,460
below that after what we stopped last time that do

98
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:36,260
play an important role in. Defining the

99
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,670
probability measure as a well defined probability

100
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,620
that we would talk about in everyday life, the

101
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,070
first of those being that if we want to consider

102
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,050
probability of well before moving out, I should

103
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,720
ask you three questions about anything that came

104
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,130
up last time, both just as well as the

105
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,730
mathematical content and always feel free to jump

106
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,910
in if any questions do come to mind. But

107
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:14,030
this is sort of. We are in some of the rooms to

108
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:21,570
switch to the schedule, so. But I was on. If it

109
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,770
wasn't here yesterday, were to a psychiatrist and

110
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,180
SWAT start

111
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,060
moving on with. These probabilities that we have a

112
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,600
probability of two events, this event occurring,

113
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:46,000
the probability of more than a six and two from

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,480
that roll of the dice. Then the probability of

115
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,750
those two events occurring is the sum of the

116
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,060
probability of each of those probabilities to

117
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,870
probability of six. So that hopefully is simple

118
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,870
and intuitive. And then if we consider the

119
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:10,760
probability of. All of the individual outcomes

120
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,410
being defined by our measurement that we impose.

121
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,400
The probability of that entire outcome space, when

122
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,330
the event space is equal to the outcome, space has

123
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,560
to equal one, which is to say that if we do an

124
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,740
experiment and measure something on it, we demand

125
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,770
that something happens.

126
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,080
And this is.

127
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,370
Again, including that measurement to project the

128
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,940
physical universe onto. Nice, well-defined

129
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,180
mathematical numbers, but if. Something happens

130
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,010
that doesn't appear in the outcome space, then we

131
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,880
should just as well say that nothing happened in

132
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,780
the first place. There was no outcome to to be

133
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,210
fortified with this probability. And then the

134
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:14,230
overall probability space is the combination of an

135
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,810
outcome space that incorporates both the

136
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:22,200
experiment itself and. The measurements that we do

137
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,210
upon it to extract these random variables, the. A

138
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,670
set of events, the event space that we are

139
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,320
interested in talking about and then the

140
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,680
probabilities that are assigned to each of the

141
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:42,350
events in that event space. So make this concrete

142
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,860
with a relatively simple but still somewhat

143
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:52,670
general or generic example, imagine that we have

144
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,970
an experiment that can produce only one out of 10

145
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,860
possible states.

146
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,840
So how states have maybe one and the relevant

147
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,840
states is this capital will make a set of all of

148
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,310
the states. Now, if only two of those states were

149
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,540
identical, then by definition they would produce

150
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,750
identical outcomes for all the measurements that

151
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,740
we would do. So

152
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:30,080
having Omega equals Omega J for J implies that the

153
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,650
measurement result is the same on both of those

154
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,740
states and the Gollan and make a J and the

155
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,580
contrapositive that logically follows from that.

156
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,210
If that statement is that if the two measurements

157
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,300
are distinct, the states themselves must be

158
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,860
distinct. But because the the measurement function

159
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:58,380
in general is not a. Unique isomorphic function

160
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,100
that maps a single state onto a single measurement,

161
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:09,080
the. The reverse direction of this relation does

162
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,130
not hold if we have two different states, we can

163
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,640
still have the same measurement on those two

164
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,130
different states. So the space of possible

165
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,630
outcomes, A, which is far off the bottom of the

166
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,040
screen there,

167
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,310
a, the outcome space we can label by the outcome

168
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:36,620
of the measurements on. Each of these large end

169
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,070
states of the universe, some of those measurement

170
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,680
outcomes will be the same for different states. So

171
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,500
the city will have some size that is smaller and

172
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:50,900
that can be no larger than the total number of

173
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,600
possible states that we are considering to be

174
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,890
finite at this stage. And in general is much, much

175
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,480
smaller. And getting back to that simple example

176
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,700
of rolling a die.

177
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,420
We know that the outcome space is just the six

178
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,490
numbers, one through six that can come out on top,

179
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,030
whereas the whole state of the universe is keeping

180
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,840
track of things like where that is ending up after

181
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,500
we roll it.

182
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:30,270
So the two indices on these lawmakers and these

183
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,240
exes, the outcomes of the measurements are not

184
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,940
necessarily mapping out to each other, but we can

185
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,300
set aside the states themselves and worry only

186
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,950
about the measurement outcomes going forward

187
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:46,710
where.

188
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,040
We can choose the event space to be a collection

189
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,600
of each of those individual outcomes, each

190
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,680
considered in isolation, and then all of those

191
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,160
isolated outcomes combined together into the set

192
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,420
of events, which is then just equal to the total

193
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,100
space of possible outcomes. And because we've

194
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,450
constructed this event space so that all of the

195
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,830
possible events are mutually exclusive of all the

196
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:31,710
others, then that each of them has a distinct

197
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:37,830
probability. So the probability of. And with this

198
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,750
event of Alpha will just hold that a little

199
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,580
reduced piece of alpha for all of the possible

200
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:52,780
outcomes of Alpha and then. The two requirements

201
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,140
to have a well-defined probability space are that

202
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,780
the probability of any two events or any two

203
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,050
outcomes occurring, alpha, beta, four different

204
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,180
alpha beta is just the sum. Of the individual

205
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,450
probabilities for each case and then the

206
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,770
probability of the full outcome set in this case,

207
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,950
the full event space is again the probability of

208
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,440
any of those outcomes occurring all of the sudden

209
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,320
from one to N, and that has to add up to one

210
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,770
hundred percent just as a statement that something

211
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:37,500
happened in the experiment that that we did. The

212
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:44,430
six sided die is the simple example that you can

213
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:52,070
use them to put a. A simple concrete understanding

214
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,650
on some of these abstract, generically checkable

215
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:02,170
mathematical definitions. So we want from the

216
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,380
assumption that this this guy is fair, there's an

217
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,860
equal probability of ending up with any of the

218
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,370
outcomes that we've defined for measuring the

219
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,720
number out on top. That is enough information to

220
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,470
actually compute the six probabilities for getting

221
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,120
those numbers out one through six.

222
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,740
And probably this is a question, what are these

223
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,830
probabilities, something that you could just tell

224
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,330
me immediately without having to think about it.

225
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,420
So go ahead and shout that.

226
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:51,980
And here that. Fair just means that each of those

227
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,840
probabilities from one to six is equal to the sum

228
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,740
of key.

229
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,470
And what is?

230
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:18,570
It is one over six and. That hopefully sounds

231
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,880
intuitively obvious, the probability for giving

232
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,760
each of the six sides it's following from

233
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,650
precisely this condition on probabilities in

234
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:35,590
general, the sum of Alpha. Going from one to six

235
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,370
of Palitha is just six feet, and that has to add

236
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:44,850
up to one hundred percent. So pee is then this,

237
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,700
that one over six from the assumption that this

238
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,470
guy is fair.

239
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,740
And we can also, again, we saw the example of the

240
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:04,770
coin four times as a single experiment with some

241
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,210
space where we wrote down with 60 elements getting

242
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,340
four heads, two heads followed by two tails, two

243
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,950
tails, followed by two heads all the way to two,

244
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,370
four tails. And we can hear

245
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,800
do that same sort of calculation to.

246
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:32,280
Figure out the probabilities for each of those

247
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,520
outcomes from assuming that the coin is fair.

248
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,710
Does anyone remember how many outcomes there were

249
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,840
in that setting, there were 16 and each of those

250
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,130
outcomes then as a one out of 16 chance of

251
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:07,400
occurring. And if we instead of taking the whole

252
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,580
event space to be the outcome space here, we're

253
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,240
showing we.

254
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,790
The power of these definitions to apply to

255
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,160
somewhat different of different circumstances we

256
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,700
can consider instead of the individual outcomes

257
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,330
for heads or tails to heads or tails, UTSA heads,

258
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,950
each of those has the probability one succeeds we

259
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,190
can. Considered different sets of events that

260
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,630
might be interested in in this case, looking to

261
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,550
see when we have equal or different numbers of

262
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,600
heads and tails coming out of those four tosses as

263
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,770
a single experiment.

264
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:54,880
So.

265
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,760
Was. I heard someone. Saying either the answer to

266
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,780
this question here or a question about it, what

267
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,770
are the probabilities that we're getting the two

268
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:18,830
events in this event space? So probability of

269
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,790
getting an equal number of heads entails the

270
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,730
probability of getting a different number.

271
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:37,450
That's. Three directly. Yeah, so there are six

272
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,470
ways of getting two heads and two tails out of

273
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:46,480
that 16 possibilities, and then it happens to be

274
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,430
that all of the other outcomes and the outcomes

275
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,940
based A have a different number of hesitations. So

276
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,850
we can take the shortcut of recognizing that the

277
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,720
probability of getting different numbers is 100

278
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,610
percent minus that three probability, which is

279
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:12,630
then five. It's just for. Reference right down, I

280
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,410
guess, on the side here, the.

281
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,220
Six.

282
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Outcomes in the first event, in this two event

283
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,500
space where.

284
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:43,010
These are all the ways of arranging those two

285
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:48,120
heads and two tails in. Any order coming from

286
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,400
flipping a coin four times?

287
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,620
So those are the. And the simplest possible

288
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:02,210
illustrations of. The definitions that we are now

289
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:07,490
through. Are there immediate questions about any

290
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:07,940
of that

291
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,860
continue or will wrap up this first sort of

292
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,710
definition section with a slightly more elaborate

293
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,240
example that will come up a bit? We'll build upon

294
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,360
a bit later on in this unit, which is looking at

295
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,500
roulette and without advocating any gambling, we

296
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,450
can think about the possible outcomes of spinning

297
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,730
a roulette wheel, assuming it's fair where with

298
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,190
this wheel has is thirty seven pockets that each

299
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,090
column with a numerical label from zero up to

300
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:53,480
thirty six. Eighteen of those are colored red 18

301
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,410
or colored black. The numbering is not in a very

302
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,410
obvious pattern there, but even in our numbers

303
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,430
that are called red, black and then pocket zero is

304
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,690
singled out, at least in this particular standard

305
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:14,270
European set up as the single green pocket in the

306
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:17,870
roulette wheel. The idea is if we spin this wheel

307
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,520
and roll all around the outside of it, eventually

308
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,500
that slows down. It falls into one of these

309
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,640
pockets randomly. And we can think about both the

310
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,570
number that is leaving that pocket as well as the

311
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:37,080
color of the pocket, which is. The colors

312
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,910
automatically specified by the number.

313
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,340
Hopefully the.

314
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,740
The focus on that projector is good enough that

315
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,160
you can are able to read off numbers around the

316
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,720
outside of their.

317
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:07,100
Enables them briefly to get a closer look at it

318
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,300
with the actually functioning that in this room

319
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:17,090
rather than yesterday's equipment. So considering.

320
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,480
Back out to the.

321
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:32,150
We were there all sorts of event spaces that we

322
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:37,220
can consider based on the outcome space A which.

323
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,810
At this point, I guess you can tell me straight

324
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,420
off the top of your head what the outcome status

325
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:44,900
is.

326
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,660
Here is the exact plan. They're.

327
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,600
There is a number going along with or sorry,

328
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,260
there's a cover going along with each of those

329
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,020
numbers that you can take to be implicitly

330
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:06,800
specified. And then the corresponding.

331
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:13,800
Probabilities. Again, coming from something over

332
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,760
these thirty seven.

333
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:26,080
Possible outcomes with the event space set equal

334
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,440
to that outcome space that some of the

335
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,300
possibilities as one. And the assumption of a

336
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,560
roulette wheel. Use any for whatever thirty seven

337
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,750
probability to each of those outcomes, and then

338
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:49,930
again, we can do. The same sort of. Construction

339
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,410
of a different event, space that doesn't map

340
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:57,160
exactly onto the outcome, space can look at the

341
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:02,330
colors. Corresponding to those thirty seven

342
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:06,200
possible outcomes and break those up into an event

343
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,530
space with three different events where the ball

344
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:13,730
ends up in some pocket with a different color, red

345
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:20,400
or black or green. And you can tell me. The.

346
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:28,590
Probability of having that. And up into a red

347
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:32,470
pocket by that sort of distributive property,

348
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,750
probability is just going to be the sum of all the

349
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,760
different pockets around there that are colored

350
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:46,210
red, which is one three. So on and not all numbers.

351
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:51,770
And thirty four is the last one. And Tom.

352
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,440
Because I've already told you that there are 18 of

353
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,720
these, so you. Can tell without having to support

354
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,890
you that. The probability of. Ending up with the

355
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:15,080
ball in a red pocket. Is 18 of the thirty seven,

356
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,480
so slightly less than 50 percent. It's the same

357
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:19,930
for.

358
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:27,090
The probability of ending up. In the black market,

359
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,640
which is the sum of the probabilities for two and

360
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,920
for up to.

361
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:45,110
Thirty five. And finally. The probability for that

362
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:50,360
rocket is the remainder. These are a mutually

363
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,780
exclusive set of events that end up covering the

364
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,330
whole outcome space about the event space itself

365
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,000
being equal to that outcome space.

366
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,870
So we'll come back to do something more

367
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,210
interesting with that roulette wheel in a bit,

368
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:12,550
just to wrap up the definition section of the

369
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:19,670
course here mentioned that. This process of

370
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:23,990
assigning probabilities to events essentially is

371
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,740
modeling in general, and what we've done in the

372
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,370
three examples of coin tosses, dice rules and

373
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:35,000
roulette tables is by assuming all of those

374
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,550
processes are fair, reduce the symmetry between

375
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,450
the size of the dye, the size of the coin or the

376
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,130
pockets in this roulette wheel to immediately

377
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:47,000
determine what all the probabilities of the

378
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,290
possible events are.

379
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,340
More generally, if we don't have those cemeteries

380
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:59,910
to rely upon, we can just repeat events time after

381
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:04,530
time and empirically observe how often these

382
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:10,080
events occur. That's an empirical estimation of

383
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,750
probabilities which gives us.

384
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,260
Results within a certain confidence level by.

385
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:23,160
Collecting a sufficient amount of observational

386
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,250
data from repeating the experiment, which is

387
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,090
disconnecting to the next topic, involves large

388
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,590
numbers where

389
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,590
it's really tells us formally how we are able to

390
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,450
infer probabilities just from repeating

391
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,600
experiments and measurements a sufficient number

392
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,530
of times so that any questions before moving on to

393
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,480
that law of large numbers.

394
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,270
So charging forward to keep the same. Simplified,

395
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:13,990
but still sort of generic situation with a outcome

396
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,860
space that has a finite number of elements that

397
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,910
the label by the measurement outcomes except one

398
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:26,070
going up to this exact little end, or there are

399
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,180
then in probabilities piece of alpha, all of which

400
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:36,340
are between zero and one. And all of which add up

401
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,980
to one without necessarily all being equal.

402
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:46,030
And we can. Generalize this notation in a way that

403
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:53,180
also applies to. Accountably, infinite sets of

404
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:58,100
outcomes from experiments and measurements where

405
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,890
instead of something explicitly over output from

406
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:05,630
one to end, we say we sum over all of the outcomes

407
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,620
X and our outcomes. It's a sum of the probability

408
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,040
of that X occurring, and that has to add up to

409
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,330
that 100 percent sum outcome happened if anything

410
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,040
happened at all.

411
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:26,800
And from the sort of notation we can define the

412
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,980
mean and the variance which are properties of the

413
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,230
probability of space space itself. So the

414
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:40,330
probability is that map these events, selections

415
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,830
of measurements onto.

416
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,140
Percentages from zero percent to one hundred

417
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:52,630
percent, where the mean is given by the expected

418
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,360
value or what I'll probably call it by having the

419
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:01,600
expectation value of the possible outcomes in the

420
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,410
outcomes space, which sum over all those possible

421
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:11,620
outcomes, X in aid of X weighted by probability of

422
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:18,350
that outcome to occur. And the variance is a

423
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,570
similar expectation value shown by these angle

424
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,410
brackets here that simply mean do that same

425
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,240
weighted sum computing this quantity X minus the

426
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,860
mean mbewe for all of the outcomes in the space

427
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,220
weighted by the corresponding probabilities. So,

428
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:45,620
yes, here there is a general definition of

429
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,370
expectation value simply being the function of

430
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:53,000
those outcomes weighted by the corresponding

431
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,870
probabilities.

432
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:00,240
And that expectation value is a linear operation,

433
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,630
if you multiply it by a cost and see that cost can

434
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,260
be pulled out of the wreckage expectation value

435
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:12,270
operation. And if you look at linear combinations

436
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,730
of two possible functions of these outcomes, F and

437
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,750
G, the expectation value of that linear

438
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,200
combination is the combination of the expectation

439
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,960
values. So.

440
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,090
I'm. Making assumptions could be wrong that these

441
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:40,290
are things like meat and dairy are things that

442
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,580
have come up before in other molecules and we can

443
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:50,600
check from the definitions. Toward the top of the

444
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,310
page, that's the standard deviation, the square

445
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:59,690
root of the variance has a simple expression in

446
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:05,540
terms of the expectation value of X squared and

447
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:10,400
the square of the expectation value of X. So if we

448
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,820
start from definition of variance, both as the

449
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,820
expectation value of.

450
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,490
But I'll start calling fluctuations around me the

451
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,940
difference between each outcome and the mean

452
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,880
outcome, that quantity squared and then take the

453
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,790
expectation value of that. You can simply expand.

454
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,840
That square and then apply the fact that the

455
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,100
expectation value is within your operation to.

456
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,550
Start getting something that. Looks familiar where

457
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:58,360
I've used the fact that this meeting is a kelson

458
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,440
property of the probability space to pull it out

459
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,590
of all those expectation values. The expectation

460
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,080
value of the concept is just the concept itself.

461
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:16,030
And because we have that new itself is an

462
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:22,000
expectation value of the individual outcomes, we

463
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,800
can rewrite this as two times the expectation,

464
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,560
value, expectation, value, and where is the

465
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:39,070
expectation value squared and you end up with. The

466
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,120
expectation value of the square minus the square,

467
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,810
the expectation value, so sigma itself is the

468
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,160
square root.

469
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:53,170
That's the difference

470
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,790
that is still on the screen, which.

471
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,000
Again, I assume it's something that is familiar.

472
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,260
I see some civilians saying that is the case.

473
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:19,570
So what we are going to do based on. The set up of

474
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,340
this new way of writing

475
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,270
outcome, spaces and spaces, means and variances is.

476
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,540
Generalize that example that we had of flipping a

477
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:37,310
coin four times, you will define a single

478
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:43,280
experiment that consists of repeating some of our

479
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,130
experiments, some number of times. So are four

480
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:50,510
repetitions. And we make the demand that each

481
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,260
repetition of the original.

482
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,630
Fundamental experience is independent of the

483
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,160
others, and in each case, we perform the same

484
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,070
measurements to get the same. A set of problems

485
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:15,830
with the same probabilities in the space and time

486
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,400
that.

487
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:24,500
New outcome, space to be B, so B is the outcome

488
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,830
space, if we repeat the original experiment to

489
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:35,710
give some space A some number of times. So based

490
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:41,440
on that definition, if we still have that original

491
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:48,250
outcome, space of X one up to X lowercase and.

492
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,480
Some of the representative events that show up and

493
00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:03,070
B, if we fix our schools. For the politicians. A

494
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:08,100
single outcome in this new event, space be. Is

495
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,160
this New Orleans Excuse me, is just going to be

496
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:17,100
poor outcomes from that original space. So just as

497
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,520
when we were flipping a coin four times, we could

498
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,970
have, say, heads, heads and heads all in a row.

499
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,230
Or since we're generalizing this, to have some

500
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:36,400
number and possible outcomes of the original

501
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,710
experiment gets repeated. We could start off with,

502
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:44,970
say, how Trump, for the first repetition won in

503
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:49,230
the second forty two in the third and then won

504
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,730
again in the fourth.

505
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,450
And all sorts of probabilities, or I should say

506
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,670
all sorts of possibilities, each with their own

507
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:10,280
probability. So I guess I can ask you at this

508
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,570
point. Knowing that the size of a number of

509
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:21,210
elements in that set is this lower case m how many?

510
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,840
Elements are we going to have in this new album

511
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,690
space be?

512
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,890
To Bill. That would be something like that if we

513
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:42,260
were flipping a coin and those two possibilities.

514
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,280
Now that we were able to get up to four point

515
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,950
forty two and an.

516
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,410
Yeah, so with R equals four, there are four

517
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:00,160
possible outcomes or being multiplied together,

518
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:03,740
and if we go back to that general and we have a

519
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,670
product of any possible outcomes for that first

520
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:11,180
experiments, that first repetition and possible

521
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,630
outcomes through the second repetition and

522
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,720
possible outcomes for all are of those repetitions

523
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,560
so and multiplicative factor. So our

524
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,110
multiplicative factors of M. So each repetition of

525
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:32,930
the experiments brings in multiplication by the

526
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:37,250
total number of possibilities. And the.

527
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,650
Even when the size of the. So fundamental, the

528
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:51,960
underlying original event space is finite once we

529
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,430
repeat the experiments of a large number of times

530
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,970
and large are, we see the size of the space of the

531
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,430
possible outcomes really rapidly growing,

532
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:08,510
exponentially growing in that. That number of

533
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,130
repetitions and.

534
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:20,660
Now. Try to keep some of that on the screen, we

535
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,230
can think about the probabilities of all of these

536
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:29,270
outcomes. Are all of these events in the larger,

537
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:34,370
repeated experiment outcome space be based on? The

538
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,180
probability is that you've assigned to the event

539
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,600
space for the original underlying experiment that

540
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,800
gets repeated. Where?

541
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:51,510
We can define the expectation value for each of

542
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:55,260
those repetitions, so that little parenthetical

543
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:00,150
label or has that mean new and variance sigma

544
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:04,980
squared? And again, just talking about four

545
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,780
repetitions for simplicity.

546
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:15,080
The probability of any of the individual outcomes

547
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,610
and be considered as an event by itself is going

548
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:24,150
to have. Each of these labels, so you could

549
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:28,920
combine the first repetition of the second

550
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,330
repetition and the third repetition in the fourth,

551
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,500
and that again multiplicative breaks up just as

552
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,540
the total number of outcomes multiplicative

553
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:49,530
depends on the outcomes in our space. A, as the

554
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:55,140
product of the independent probability of getting

555
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,880
that outcome by the first replication times, the

556
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,030
probability of getting the outcome accepted and

557
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:07,250
the second repetition. And similarly for x axis of

558
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:11,310
evil, in the third and fourth repetitions where

559
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,910
the individual probabilities are coming from an

560
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,820
outcomes based A. Which is now being related to

561
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:25,430
the much bigger conspiracy by. The assumption that

562
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:29,510
all of the repeated experiments are independent of

563
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,380
all the others.

564
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:38,760
And what we can now define probably another

565
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:47,000
familiar concept, is the arithmetic mean? As

566
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,770
opposed to the true meaning of the probability

567
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:56,120
space that requires exact knowledge of all of the

568
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,510
outcomes and all probabilities in that space, is

569
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,290
arithmetic mean is what came up at the end of the

570
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,660
previous section? Are we talking about figuring

571
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:10,370
out probabilities by repeating an experiment some

572
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:15,080
number of times this averaging over the possible

573
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,660
outcomes that are observed?

574
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,700
And that's the key point, is that this arithmetic

575
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:28,430
mean is a random variable. So it's a measurement

576
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:32,300
that we can perform in that appears in the open

577
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,410
space. B.

578
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:40,020
Where we simply add up the values of the

579
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,420
measurements for each individual, repetition

580
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,960
average over the number of repetitions and define

581
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:52,490
this arithmetic mean. X bar with a given number of

582
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:58,190
repetitions that is set in advance and so for.

583
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,270
Each element in that repeated experiment out of

584
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,820
space, we would get a slightly different estimates

585
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:11,540
or empirical observation for this arithmetic mean,

586
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:16,100
but we do expect that the arithmetic mean is

587
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:21,110
related to the true meaning of the distribution.

588
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:26,700
Particularly of the. Distribution, a single

589
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,150
experiment, distribution that we can have an

590
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:34,500
easier time getting a mathematical grip on. And

591
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,520
there is a relation that can be proved rigourously

592
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,820
as. That number of repetitions goes to infinity,

593
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:49,330
given the assumption that the variance. Of the.

594
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,690
Original experiments without consent is a is

595
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:00,340
finite in the footnote, there is just a note that

596
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,790
the second part of the computer project is going

597
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:07,180
to focus on what can happen if that assumption

598
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:10,540
breaks down to the variance is is infinite for a

599
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:15,520
distribution and looking at the time.

600
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:25,180
And debating whether there is enough time to go

601
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:30,030
through the little denervation, establishing this

602
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,240
equivalence, and I think that might actually be a

603
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,660
nice thing to start off with on Friday rather than

604
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:41,230
trying to squeeze it in in the last couple of

605
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:46,810
minutes. So just do one more poll for any any

606
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:50,370
questions that have come up in the course of today.

607
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,360
Any word on how many strain

608
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,860
that's notation I've seen in various places, but

609
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:14,030
that's sort of a shorthand to fill in the space

610
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:17,390
available. Not anything really crucial. So just

611
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:23,710
using the it's called the no sign to refer to here

612
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,590
the number of elements in A or B.

613
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:34,420
This is not universal, but also I'm not the only

614
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:40,030
one who has employed that, so to you ask about do.

615
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:45,270
And.

616
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:54,980
With that, I will. Shut down the recordings, you

617
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,940
say, thanks to those of you who have not been able

618
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,610
to make it, but have told me that you're unwell

619
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,880
and they're joining you because it's all about

620
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,520
class, that we can tell who's here, who isn't. And

621
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,850
I appreciate you kept in touch about how things

622
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,470
are going. So

623
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:19,640
hopefully as the spring progresses.

624
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:24,380
There

625
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:31,990
will be less. Illness going around.
