1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,920
Well, the bills have rung and we're all back again for the

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,650
last bit of Statistical Physics for this week.

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,590
With the

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,700
new six-digit code two seven two seven five seven

5
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,170
And, yeah

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,250
the tutorial gives us a chance to talk about some stuff

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,110
beyond the main core of the lecture notes, some

8
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,230
stuff that may not appear on the exams.  It occurred to

9
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:53,570
me that those of you---either here at the moment or

10
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,060
catching up with this recording after the fact---I'm

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,620
not sure how

12
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,460
thoroughly you've gone through all of the stuff

13
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,720
that was posted to the "Modules" page on

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:14,010
Canvas for this module.  There is this article

15
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,180
from just a few months ago, November 2021,

16
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,460
talking about the title of "The Demons

17
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,130
Haunting Thermodynamics", which looks better when it's

18
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,720
spread across two pages side by side. But the work

19
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,510
we've been doing with the mixing entropy. The

20
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,930
Gibbs paradox in the general thought experiment of

21
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,690
bringing two systems together, letting them

22
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,480
exchange particles and seeing whether the

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,970
resulting change in entropy is consistent with the

24
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,590
second law of thermodynamics is the spots in this

25
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,100
module where. This particular article becomes

26
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,300
relevant and interesting in particular, if I can

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,430
zoom in on.

28
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,920
One of these figures here, I guess that is the.

29
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,110
Highest level of zoom, the cameras will let me do.

30
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,420
It's embedded screen share.

31
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,830
Which I guess will suffice. This is an

32
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,840
illustration of a concept sort of similar to the

33
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,280
games paradox and statistical physics, say similar

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
sort of thought experiments known as Maxwell's

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,610
demon. The idea being that if we have these two

36
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,560
ideal gases, so each of these screening, the

37
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,610
particle has the momentum bouncing around each of

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,760
two containers separated by a wall. The question

39
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,920
of the thought experiment is what if there were

40
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,410
some way for someone to choose which of these

41
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,610
particles moves from one of these points to the

42
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,730
other, depending on their properties? And the

43
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,080
specific properties that Maxwell considered was

44
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:19,360
saying there was even some device that. Could tell

45
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,160
the energy of any particle that approached it and

46
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,640
depending on whether that energy were relatively

47
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,540
high compared to those particular articles in this

48
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,110
case, because of that particle, absolutely nothing

49
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,530
to keep it unless there was already there. On the

50
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,870
other hand, if the particle energy were relatively

51
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,970
low, it could be the returns. This container on

52
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:51,400
the. It's a very big. So if that sort of process.

53
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,190
Could be implemented not necessarily by a demonic

54
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,730
creature or by some clever device or the rotating

55
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:06,350
door ratchet system that was sensitive to particle

56
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,530
energy using the particles to pass or be blocked

57
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,960
depending on those energies. Then what would

58
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,400
happen over time that we started off with? U.S.

59
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,390
civilians have the same temperature. As the higher

60
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,710
energy particles were allowed to congregate or

61
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,570
accumulate in the left volume, the average

62
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,540
internal energy that supported would increase as

63
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,530
its temperature super hot new gas that the

64
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,310
internal energy is directly proportional to the

65
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,450
temperature of the gas.

66
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,450
And at the same time, the opposite can happen and

67
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,910
the other supporting entities that are opposing

68
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,110
would all come lower than the average for those

69
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,780
two systems leading to a lower. Temperatures have

70
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,630
started from two systems with the same temperature.

71
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:08,290
This demon would cause a net flow of energy from

72
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,410
one of those systems to the other reason, the

73
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,510
temperature of one, lowering the temperature of

74
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,090
another, sort of the opposite of what we expect

75
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,690
from the second law of thermodynamics. So

76
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:25,860
violation of that second law. And now this, of

77
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,680
course, started off as a thought experiment in the

78
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,860
eighteen hundreds, which is why it features this

79
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,860
demonic entity controlling the. Passage of these

80
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,200
particles depending on their energy. But there are

81
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,280
ongoing experiments that do this sort of thing.

82
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,560
This is an illustration of. From about 10 years

83
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,230
ago, which rather than having. A bunch of

84
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,910
particles of gas between them, it had particles in

85
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,240
what was called an optical lattice, so shiny laser

86
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,910
beams across each other to create the potential

87
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,710
that particles could interact with. And those

88
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,010
particles were the optical lattice out in such a

89
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,910
way. They were a sequence of energy models for

90
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:23,200
these particles. This energy is represented by the

91
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,990
steps of the surface and the particles. Have

92
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,360
probabilities used to fluctuate, goes down the

93
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,780
staircase as well as at some points and by

94
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:41,380
imposing a. Opposing the voltage, what is shown

95
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,870
here as the square being put in place by that

96
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,610
natural steam in the provincial department all the

97
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,890
way down the staircase, whenever it happens to

98
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,760
fluctuate up the staircase, they quickly shifted

99
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,840
this block to the next higher set. So what happens

100
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,450
over time with this system is that the particle

101
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,180
cannot move down the staircase. It's blocked

102
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,640
whenever it fluctuates up. The demon blocks of the

103
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,350
new law, also the particle continues to accumulate

104
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,610
a higher and higher energy costs, higher positions

105
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,730
on this dramatic staircase. This is an

106
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,300
experimental realization that even as these

107
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,140
particles are being forced to have higher energies

108
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,050
in this system, that corresponds to a reduction in

109
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,890
the entropy of the system and raises the

110
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,770
possibility of violating the second law of

111
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,960
thermodynamics, the.

112
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:52,090
The solution that. You have a question, though,

113
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,950
the question is whether or not the second plane

114
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,500
actually is violated in his experience, the answer

115
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,780
to exactly that is not because that information.

116
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,850
Essentially, what is going on is that the action

117
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,670
of this quote unquote demon, the cross, the

118
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,240
procedure by which these blocks are put into place,

119
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,970
also is requires energy to operate and requires

120
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,660
information processor to monitor the energy of the

121
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,530
particles and adjust the water with energy changes.

122
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,960
If you add together, the entropy is not only of

123
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,630
the system, but also of this device, the steam

124
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,830
that is reducing the entropy of the system, the

125
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,770
overall contribution, the entropy coming from the

126
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,930
system. On the one hand, the device on the other

127
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,920
ends up in such a way that it can increase it as

128
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,220
time goes on. So I want to.

129
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,490
We'll go through any more details about that next.

130
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,660
Stephen is one of the funding thought experiments

131
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,410
to talk about in statistical physics related to

132
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,270
the sort of particle mixing processes that we have

133
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,600
been

134
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,720
discussing this weekend and last week. In this

135
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,100
article, as I said, is on the campus site for the

136
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:32,160
module, if you feel inclined to check out some of

137
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,070
the additional details that it contains, which

138
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,830
also bring up the. There is there are other demons

139
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,520
that have been proposed in thermodynamics history,

140
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,500
including the Pluses Demon, a theoretical entity

141
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,630
that knows the positions and momentum of all

142
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,800
particles in the universe and can thus predict how

143
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,120
the universe as a whole will evolve since the

144
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,210
point of a tutorial is not to. Listen to me talk

145
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,660
or rather have a chance to ask any questions that

146
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,250
you have. Feel free to shout them out, or if you

147
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,280
don't have questions, have something to work on

148
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:23,740
yourself. I have here. An exercise related to the

149
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,990
mixing entropy that can spend some time working on

150
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:34,300
to make sure that what we went through, the

151
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,920
example we went through in class is all clear and

152
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:45,750
in particular. I switch over to the project

153
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,690
briefly, um. When we did the political lexicon.

154
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,400
Thought experiment a few days ago. So this is a

155
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,540
reminder of how the stages are set up with two

156
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,810
nautical systems that are initially separated, the

157
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,700
walls separating them and removed, they're allowed

158
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,920
to exchange particles and then that wall is

159
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:15,130
reinserted, sort of wrote down the formal

160
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:23,460
expression materials during the focus, see? Can be

161
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,210
improved.

162
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,210
I guess the expression here is not of so much

163
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,120
importance. The point is that although we wrote it

164
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,870
down, we didn't make an attempt to evaluate it, to

165
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:43,570
confirm that reinserting this wall, separating the

166
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,310
systems at the final stage does indeed lead to

167
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,650
behavior consistent with the second part from the

168
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,040
entropy is not decreasing as we separate new

169
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:02,390
systems. So and of course, that was. Only

170
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,000
problematic for the case of distinguishable

171
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,120
particles who were fully indistinguishable

172
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,680
articles in the interview was just constant

173
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,900
throughout this process of removing the wall,

174
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,780
reinserting. But the distinguishable case, there

175
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,610
was culture of mixing in and the question that was

176
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,910
left hanging, that's. It's what happens to the

177
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:34,010
entropy as. The wall is reinserted, have a more

178
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,280
complicated expression to compute, so that is

179
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,830
through the. The two tasks for this particular

180
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,420
tutorial probably have a chance to work on that

181
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:55,270
today is. Trying to simplify the setup of. These

182
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,710
distinguishable versus indistinguishable particles

183
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,950
by supposing that. We have. As in the initial case,

184
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,300
two systems with each with particle's and within

185
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,260
each of these two systems, the particles amongst

186
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,210
themselves are indistinguishable. But at the same

187
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,390
time, the particles in one system can be

188
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,030
distinguished from the particles in another system

189
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,810
by some property. Here we are using the color to

190
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:32,880
do that. We. Color the particles initially left,

191
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,790
when you read those initially in the right volume

192
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,630
or blue, and after we go through that process of

193
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,720
removing the wall, allowing particle mixing

194
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,900
particle exchange and then reinserting the wall,

195
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,670
the red particles and particles, we can expect to

196
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,900
be scrambled between the two we separated boxes.

197
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,090
So in the initial state, we computed the entropy

198
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:05,820
in class five plus 10 times, the log of this ratio

199
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,600
of the volume to end times the cube of the thermal

200
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,870
deployed wavelength. And the first question for

201
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:20,570
this case, that is somewhat. Intermediate between.

202
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:25,060
Or. Distinguishable and indistinguishable

203
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,710
particles is to compute the mixing energy from the

204
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,230
combined system, the intermediate stage is not

205
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,920
shown in this drawing when all two of these

206
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,870
particles have access to the full volume of the

207
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:47,120
extent to be. So the starting point for that

208
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:51,110
computation is the protection function for that

209
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:57,350
combined system where we have to add particles in

210
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,310
this to volume. And.

211
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,210
And of those particles are indistinguishable

212
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,690
amongst themselves. So the overall partition

213
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,470
function. Starts off with the product of to end

214
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,900
single particle production functions. For those

215
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,140
two in particles and then has to compensate for

216
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,150
overcounting, just as we saw in the. Tastefully

217
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,050
indistinguishable particles. The only wrinkle here

218
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,310
is that we are only overcounting by this factor of

219
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,300
whatever and vectorial for the red particles times

220
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,720
one over and vectorial for the blue particles. So

221
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,000
whatever and vectorial squared, which is much

222
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,380
smaller than the one over tumin, actual, real that

223
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,330
we had four fully distinguishable particles. And

224
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:02,270
then once we have determined the mixing entropy

225
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,870
that arises when the wall is removed and the

226
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:11,360
system. The second task is to compute the final

227
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,780
entropy. So once the wall is reinserted and we

228
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,700
have mixtures of red of the particles on each side

229
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,660
or each of the two, we separate the systems. The

230
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,920
question is, what is the final entropy that we do

231
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,950
not attempt to compute in class? And in particular,

232
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,330
the question of whether the final entropy obeys

233
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,460
the second law of thermodynamics and ends up

234
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:43,120
larger than. The entropy of the combined system.

235
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,260
So I'll give you a few minutes to get started on

236
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,830
that. I'll check in again and maybe five minutes

237
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,750
to see how you got involved with. Computing, just

238
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,400
the mixing entropy in the.

239
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,110
Somewhat more straightforward parts compared to

240
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,280
the final entropy, then, depending on how things

241
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:11,620
are going, we will. See where they go from there.

242
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,160
That was the time to do a quick check in how

243
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:54,050
you're getting on, whether you have a result for

244
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:59,270
this first task or it's more time to keep working

245
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,810
on that.

246
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:07,730
It's.

247
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,380
Syncope is the difference between the entropy of

248
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,240
the combined system minus that of the initial

249
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,320
system. This. Anyone done with that calculation

250
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,930
wants to. Shout out to the result they got or. So

251
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,530
they want to say they want more time to keep

252
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,600
working on that part of things.

253
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:14,010
Is that. Sounds like we're still working, said

254
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,460
another five minutes time check, checking again.

255
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:23,090
And after that point, to pause the recording a bit

256
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,160
more promptly at this time.

257
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,290
Since we're back now to address a question and

258
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:40,760
I'll switch over to the projector from your Web

259
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,360
browser.

260
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,300
And to

261
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:56,000
add a little bit of confusion to. This picture

262
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,930
that we have here still zoomed in a bit more and

263
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,920
then each of these.

264
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:08,490
Two compartments that are separated by a wall. We

265
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:13,920
have the same temperature, volume and number of

266
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,730
particles.

267
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,290
On each side, the total value, what's the system

268
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:29,520
is combined. So in the divine system. We have that

269
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,770
going to be with two particles and then once the

270
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,970
system is or the systems are separated, that will

271
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,360
be inserted. Then there is just particles in each

272
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:53,350
box to avoid being so. I don't know why the. Focus

273
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,110
on the overhead projector is so bad, but hopefully

274
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:02,590
that clarifies a bit what? Shown here, this is not

275
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:08,270
letting me zoom in anymore. So it sounds like some

276
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:13,510
of you have moved on from the. Mixing entropy

277
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,420
computation to computing the final entropy. So.

278
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,310
You get another minute or two. I'll check in again

279
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,490
about the result for the first half. See if that's

280
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,940
worth going over on the recording.

281
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,300
And.

282
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,810
You all the recording is underway, I'll mention a

283
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,210
identity that may prove useful in that second part,

284
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:06,620
which is a relation between. The. Three binomial

285
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,200
coefficients, particularly relating binomial

286
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,880
coefficient of two, and she was then would be some

287
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,020
of the squares, the binomial coefficients for and

288
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:24,890
she was K for all K from zero to end. And then in

289
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,780
Europe, this tends to be known as the abandonment

290
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,700
identity.

291
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:40,150
Or Bannerman's Identity, which was published in 17

292
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,100
70s, about four hundred fifty years after it had

293
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,410
been derived by its Chinese mathematician, Zhou

294
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,380
Shuja, which whose name I obviously cannot

295
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,380
pronounce, I apologize for the butchering of

296
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:00,910
however it is meant to be pronounced properly.

297
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:07,870
This fellow came up with this identity that will

298
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,780
be useful in the second part.

299
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:19,070
No one system is no longer filling the screen, you

300
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,260
came up with that more than seven hundred years

301
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,710
ago.

302
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,420
Download the file. It would be a bit more. Well

303
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,150
behaved.

304
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,210
Yes, that is certainly more flexible.

305
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,430
Plus, the recording, again, for. Another few

306
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:10,910
minutes.

307
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,580
And if you do finish up with the mixing entropy in

308
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:21,990
that time, go on to that second task. Keep

309
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,790
yourself busy and just let me know how you're

310
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:26,730
progressing.

311
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:39,040
That is the final stretch for this afternoon and

312
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:45,150
maybe to. Get things wrapped up. I'll see you

313
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:50,380
again if anyone wants to shout out. A. The result

314
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,100
for the mixing entropy on removing the ball,

315
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,020
dividing the two systems.

316
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:03,900
Know.

317
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,120
So that's a complicated and more complicated

318
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,730
expression than I have I found

319
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:23,620
to and more to as this resource for the entropy

320
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,300
when we combine the system compared to the entropy

321
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,990
from the initial state when the system is

322
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,850
separated. It sounds like that was not what you

323
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:39,900
were finding. Let me go through one or two ways to

324
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:45,130
calculate this mixing entropy reasonably quickly.

325
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:51,430
It is possible to start from the proficient

326
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,840
function for that combined system, 50 logarithm to

327
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:59,130
find out the energy, the derivative of the energy

328
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:04,300
supply, the residual energy or the entropy. But

329
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,920
there's actually a trick that we can do by

330
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:13,020
inspecting this partition function carefully here.

331
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:20,730
The trick is to rewrite the zc as.

332
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,770
A product of two factors

333
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:32,870
will have to work on the one hand

334
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,180
and left over the other. There were, in fact, all

335
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,500
the other factors

336
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,550
related to.

337
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:56,270
And what we can do based on this way is recognize

338
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:01,170
that each of these identical terms is the.

339
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,850
Can I go with a function for an indistinguishable

340
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,620
particles in

341
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,840
two great. There are two factors, not a political

342
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,890
indistinguishable protection function, which is an

343
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:26,020
interesting result, already said that the once the

344
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,050
barrier is removed and the particles are allowed

345
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:33,210
to mix in this volume, they behave incredibly

346
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,860
independently of the other. And what we end up

347
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:40,630
with is, in essence, two copies of an

348
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,580
indistinguishable particles, one copy for the

349
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:48,760
particles, one be for the particles. The

350
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:55,270
corresponding entropy then is twice the entropy

351
00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:00,890
for the particles in way to be a very powerful

352
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,450
class.

353
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,860
Size five has crossed

354
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:17,680
over in the first place. And here's.

355
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:27,470
All the is in place, if I shift the screen here a

356
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:32,090
bit to compare that combined entropy with the

357
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,420
starting entropy, what

358
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,240
was?

359
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:48,500
The Times, the signature factor of five, and it's

360
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:48,980
allowed.

361
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,740
Everything in the two in the Atlantic will cancel

362
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:04,420
out what is left is two and two that I claim was

363
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,180
my answer. So.

364
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:16,360
One possibly surprising thing about this result is

365
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,170
that it is exactly the same as the Fab Four,

366
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,620
completely distinguishable particles as opposed to

367
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,750
this case, or we have two sets of particles that

368
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,120
are in the same cells that are distinguishable

369
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:36,760
from the other sets. Compared to the fully

370
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,040
distinguishable case, both

371
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:44,890
biometrically are smaller, there are fewer

372
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,360
microstates exactly makes utility. But the

373
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,870
difference between them removing this wall and

374
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,810
allowing the predators makes. Ends up being

375
00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:00,880
exactly the same, which is something that a nice

376
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,850
aspect of this documentation that I enjoy. There

377
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,820
is also a second way of doing this computation

378
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:16,000
that wouldn't rely on through our notes or

379
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:20,630
expression would be indistinguishable entropy or a

380
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:25,820
number of particles of the bullet. And this other

381
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,180
trick is a bit more generally applicable.

382
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:37,080
The approach is to recall that the Entropia,

383
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:45,310
in terms of the HUMBOLDT'S energy, is the negative

384
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,570
derivative with respect to temperature of that

385
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:53,490
free energy and Freelander yourself, like negative

386
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:58,000
temperature, climbs more of the partition function.

387
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,420
So putting things together

388
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,780
with all means

389
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,160
and if we look only at.

390
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:17,110
Differences between countries, which is what this

391
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:22,170
makes America, is that the purpose of liberty is a

392
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:30,310
linear alteration and it's an Zitter difference

393
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,020
between.

394
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,150
Two energy is.

395
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,930
This, the partition function system, partition

396
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:48,980
function, which if I combine those logs and divide

397
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,180
up this product, I use your product rule

398
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,420
derivative of T with respect to T is just more of

399
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:07,890
the lower the ratio of functions. Lots and lots of

400
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,700
balls of ratio's.

401
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,240
That's visible around the screen, part of the

402
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,820
simplification from this approach is that this

403
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:28,560
board of protection functions tends to be and is

404
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,510
in this case easily seen to be independent of the

405
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,720
temperature so that this whole second term

406
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,320
vanishes from the outset. And we just have to

407
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:45,270
compute the logarithm of canonical partition

408
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:54,210
functions. So we are. Given. The. Partition

409
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:59,290
function for the combined system. And if we can

410
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:04,120
know, we can figure out that provision for the

411
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,100
initial system,

412
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,290
if I showed this

413
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:18,310
this expression, I get rid of a fairly complicated

414
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,510
looking ratio. The combined system we have.

415
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:24,990
Square.

416
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:36,330
Times is changing over used to intelligence, and

417
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:40,560
that is the greater discretion whether to combine

418
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:48,450
systems going to have dual. Information for an

419
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,970
independent particles in.

420
00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:02,450
In a volume V so we can have in the system and you

421
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:06,010
will have one factor of that from the system. Well,

422
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:11,100
that's one factor of the system, the loose. And

423
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,480
it's easy to look at the terms of the numerator

424
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,950
over here. It's like in factorial, the video will

425
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,500
accuse the factor of two of the square come in and

426
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:32,240
all that is left is smaller than on to three and

427
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,140
which is going

428
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:41,480
through the same result. The other needs

429
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:49,460
see how we're doing for time, which is already. So.

430
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:54,410
With this is hopefully inspiration or illustration,

431
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:59,280
just you can keep plugging away at the task then

432
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:03,320
of computing the final entropy, the especially

433
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,470
interesting bits of this exercise, and we will

434
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:10,580
check in about that this time next week or so

435
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,120
before then. I'll see you on Monday for the wrap

436
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,810
up of the current cycle and starting the grand

437
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,530
canonical ensemble. Hope you have a nice weekend

438
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:21,940
in.
