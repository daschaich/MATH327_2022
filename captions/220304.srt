1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,520
All right, despite the small crowd, I'll start

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,830
getting things underway.

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,180
It's a more pleasant day outside than the last few

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,870
and at least some folks were up late last night

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:25,030
getting that homework assignment in on time. So you

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,330
feel relieved about being halfway through all the

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,950
homeworks with this module already.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:39,990
And the usual starting businesses is the six-digit number

9
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:49,100
for the attendance monitoring system this morning, which is nine three two nine

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,710
seven seven.

11
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,320
And I'll put a bit more on the board under it as we

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,600
recap where we have been this past week or

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,860
the past few weeks.  Are there any questions to

14
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,530
bring up before I dive in?

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,190
Actually, I can mention that an interesting

16
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,510
question came in asynchronously over this past

17
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,830
week, which I will try to write up a bit about on

18
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,370
the Canvas discussion board over the weekend that

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,880
maybe once I catch up with all the debarking is

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,000
now a bit late on my part. This question was, how

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,900
do we actually tell if the system is in

22
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,080
equilibrium? Some of you have been assuming it is

23
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,100
in the canonical ensemble that all of our systems

24
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,670
are in equilibrium. All of the microsleep

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,790
probabilities are equal and there are, I guess,

26
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,200
both theoretical and practical answers to how we

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,380
can verify that this is actually the case in

28
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,880
theory, if we. Imagine we can measure what

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,660
microstates system is in, we just have to repeat

30
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,820
all of those measurements a sufficient number of

31
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,540
times to see that these microstates are popping up

32
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,140
with equal probability that results from similar

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,760
equilibrium in the case of the micro ensemble. But

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,570
in practice, there are a couple of obvious

35
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,720
problems with that pozole, one being that

36
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,870
determining the micro state requires mapping out

37
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,290
the behavior of all of the microscopic degrees of

38
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,420
freedom in that state, usually not something we

39
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,440
can do in practice. Imagine figuring out the

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,290
locations are meant to have all the air molecules

41
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,740
in this room. And in the micro canonical case

42
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,160
specifically, there's the requirement that energy

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,670
be conserved in that system. And if we were to

44
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,300
dive in and try to measure all of its degrees of

45
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,850
freedom, we wouldn't necessarily be interacting

46
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,030
with it, exchanging energy with violating that

47
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,240
assumption for the microeconomic example. So the

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,580
practical answer is that's not something you

49
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,830
really do with the micro canonical ensemble. You

50
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,280
want to look at the large scale macroscopic

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,820
thermodynamic properties of the system, which is

52
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,510
why we have turned to the canonical ensemble and

53
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:30,870
actually gives me a. Segway into the recap of what

54
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,790
we've been doing over the past few weeks, that is

55
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,590
on the screen for the morning at.

56
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,900
Before the march.

57
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,740
So today, we are still in the process of bringing

58
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,170
everything together from the past few weeks,

59
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,250
starting with the canonical ensemble where our

60
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,810
system is in full contact with some large external

61
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,470
reservoir that fixes its temperature and allows it

62
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,580
to issue energy. And in the ensemble, we've looked

63
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,700
at specific systems of Baddiel gases

64
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,700
that are placed into some container of a volume

65
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,450
beam. And we have. This week, they're considering

66
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,150
ways that we can manipulate the systems of ideal

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,580
gases in their container to.

68
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,580
Have them do stuff for us.

69
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,470
And in particular.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,900
Designing a sequence of changes to these systems

71
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,730
that can be brought together into a closed cycle

72
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,490
that we will repeat and that's what we will

73
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,030
continue with today, possibly wrap up, maybe not

74
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,430
finish. It's on Monday, but the.

75
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,670
We have seen that two generic ways of manipulating

76
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,410
these ideal systems to change their energy, so.

77
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,570
Using our control.

78
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,320
Over the control parameters, the temperature of

79
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,040
volubly systems, and remembering that when we are

80
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,100
changing the energy of the system, you're really

81
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:25,530
exchanging that energy with its surroundings, fix

82
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,700
its temperature. And those two ways are.

83
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,020
Quantities we we've defined as heat and work where

84
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:45,450
work. Results from some change. The volume. Due to

85
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,800
the application of Air Force. The connection to

86
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,780
the classical mechanics concept of working for

87
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,300
some physicians, that work is infinitesimally the

88
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,180
negative of PDV energy increases when the going

89
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,470
gets smaller, depressed, which we can integrate to.

90
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,320
It's not if it doesn't work in the heat. Have

91
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,100
connected to changes in the entropy.

92
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,290
She is the temperature times that does change in

93
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,090
entropy. And then.

94
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,310
Putting together lots of these changes, we have to

95
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,790
really make cycles that we can analyze with the

96
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,860
four equations that have been set aside about this

97
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,210
board for reference. The first thing, the internal

98
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,530
energy for the House and the of the past, it's

99
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,700
been indistinguishable from the connection between

100
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,060
the temperature and total energy of an ideal. Gas

101
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,190
is a fixed number of particles of economical

102
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,460
ensemble. We then have the condition of constant

103
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,090
entropy at the volume of the gas times, the three

104
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:08,930
power.

105
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,840
Constance.

106
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,630
To

107
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,970
adiabatic cycles, so much better processes in

108
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,500
which he does not exchange dive into that after

109
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,470
this recounts that have the equation of state the

110
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,540
of small.

111
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,270
What? Well, you

112
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,100
said the number of steps, the temperature and then

113
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,370
the generalized, first of all, from dynamics,

114
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,630
which is broke down there, the change in the

115
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,480
internal energy of the system. He calls were.

116
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:05,760
Smiles

117
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,350
and.

118
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,490
That's the easy way to keep track of these

119
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,330
processes. We have introduced pressure building

120
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,300
diagrams where the macro state of the system is

121
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,420
specified entirely by the pressure and the volume

122
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,310
that determines the temperature through the

123
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,130
internal energy.

124
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,620
And two particular processes.

125
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,770
That we have.

126
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,630
Looked at all these preferably diagrams

127
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,120
rewriting prison walls or isothermal processes

128
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,450
that are slow enough that all possible heat

129
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,550
exchanges completed and the temperature remains

130
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,350
constant as the pressure and volume are changed.

131
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,040
So every point on this line is this is a different

132
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,580
canonical ensemble. The big difference volume for

133
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,410
the ideal gas and correspondingly different

134
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,100
pressure subject to the condition of a fixed

135
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,560
temperature. And where we wrapped up on Tuesday

136
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:29,040
was a similar consideration of. Maybe that's the

137
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,310
line on the PV diagram for processes that are fast

138
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,600
enough that no heat is exchanged and therefore no

139
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:47,370
energy tubes is the heat, the entropy is not

140
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,460
changing on the so-called eightieths that connect

141
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,470
to different levels that are parallel curves on

142
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,100
these pressure volume diagrams with two different

143
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,720
temperatures. And that's where we have left off

144
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,360
with this idea that was figuring out the change of

145
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,780
the temperature as we compress the volume from

146
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,080
something.

147
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,310
See, what I can get down here is we compress the

148
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,640
volume from some larger going to a smaller final

149
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,590
volume we can see. If we believe what we doing

150
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,410
here, that the pressure is going up and the

151
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,000
temperature then is also going up. Which we can

152
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,520
tell from the audio, that's all the product of the

153
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,600
time to be is proportional to the temperature. And

154
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,400
if we go straight up increasing the pressure to

155
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,150
fix volume, we see that we the final temperatures

156
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,190
to be larger, the initial temperature. We verify

157
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,650
that last time since this initial volume over the

158
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,200
final volume will be raised, about two thirds is

159
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,480
greater than what the change in temperature is to

160
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,550
zero. And now we want to figure out the.

161
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,170
Change in the pressure that is coming from this

162
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:18,750
idiomatic expression, decreasing the volume. Of

163
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,850
our system, and

164
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,160
we have all the ingredients from what we've

165
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,070
already done and been talking equations up here,

166
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:35,800
and I'm actually going to. Do is rewrite our

167
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,010
starting point, the condition of constant entropy

168
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,990
that defines the Aliabadi process of no heat

169
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:48,410
exchange. And if I take. That expressions of the

170
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,990
condition of constant entropy from the start of

171
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,800
the process to the end, if I hit, that would be

172
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,730
ideal gas law, right? I guess I should say, I

173
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:04,220
think the two thirds power of all of the.

174
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,960
Quantities in this expression that the ideal gas

175
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,440
law is relating to the initial temperature to

176
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,960
pressure times volume. Over the number of

177
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,630
particles at that initial stage. And this is

178
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,900
similarly equal to the two thirds hour of the

179
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:30,070
final volume times the final. Pressure, volume,

180
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,950
and will the ends cancel and just rearrange this?

181
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,990
We get the final pressure in terms of the initial

182
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,400
pressure. That is.

183
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,440
And say zero factor up front and then two thirds

184
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:55,200
times another three thirds power of the initial

185
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,190
volume is the initial volume, five thirds power at

186
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:04,530
a similar volume to the firefighters factor and

187
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,270
states that we divide out.

188
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:15,520
On both sides and. You can then. Write down

189
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,330
similar looking change in the pressure just in

190
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,690
terms of the initial pressure and this compression

191
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:28,120
factor, the ratio of initial and final volumes. So

192
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,420
it looks a lot like the change in temperature. The

193
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,640
difference is we have pressures rather than

194
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,570
temperatures over again. And the. Howard, that

195
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:45,750
this. Boy ratio is raised to is up to five thirds

196
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,940
rather than two thirds, as well as fraction of

197
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,260
what it is, it is still positive, as we drew in

198
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:02,400
the initial diagram. So that diagram, at least, is

199
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,470
taking together. That's an accurate description of

200
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:15,720
what is going on. So. That gets us through the

201
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,920
section we're working on to back up to where we

202
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,340
left off on Tuesday, the final section in this

203
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:28,410
unit and in our main application. Of the canonical

204
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,770
ensemble, 28 Gas's. I'm guessing hard questions

205
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,130
about all that, regardless of which you've seen

206
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,340
before, but this is an opportunity to shut one out

207
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,650
before we move on to an actual bona fide for the

208
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:50,990
next Michael. As advertised, a connection or a

209
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:57,020
collection of processes that. Form a closed loop,

210
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,030
circling back around to your starting point, and

211
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,920
it may well be. Worthwhile for you to try to draw

212
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,540
this particular cycle on the border. So you have a

213
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:16,160
sense that there's two weeks

214
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:24,920
later ages and and and diagram the starting is

215
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,890
that we have a expansion. And in the pressure from

216
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,680
some initial point to some B and then a different

217
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:47,500
type of expansion details into off to see you

218
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,490
compress the system. So D then the final.

219
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,900
Progression to get back to that starting point

220
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,970
and before diving into the details of each of

221
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,000
those processes, let's see. Let's. It was sort of

222
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,670
the key idea that was introduced by the fellow,

223
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,050
the cycle is named after her go back in the 18, 20

224
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,070
years before the laws of thermodynamics, before

225
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:22,760
you came up with the idea of having our ideal gas

226
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:28,200
system, the working substance of this process. In

227
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,060
a container that can exchange energy. With not one

228
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,540
external thermal reservoir to fix its temperature,

229
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,200
but rather with two reservoirs, one of which is

230
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,620
hotter than the other. So we have a hot reservoir

231
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,020
with a high temperature and a cool reservoir with

232
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,760
a low temperature tell. The idea is that by.

233
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,230
Allowing the system to exchange heat with both of

234
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:03,160
these hot and cold reservoirs, that is a practical

235
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:09,610
way to realize this thermodynamic cycle and as we

236
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,690
will see, you use it to do useful work on its

237
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,150
surroundings. So.

238
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,820
We produced the highlights that the high low

239
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,290
temperatures are going to be identified with the.

240
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,550
State of the system with microstates at these.

241
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,430
A man to see in this pressure building a diagram

242
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,200
of the size that we have just above the high

243
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,830
temperature,

244
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,040
the low temperature and our main control parameter

245
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,130
is going to be the whole system. We can expand

246
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:09,720
from point A to point B, C, then compress boys and

247
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,420
back up to volume A. We imagine that we to survive

248
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,920
the initial pressure that comes along that from

249
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,650
the ideal gas law from going forward and the

250
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,390
temperature. And that's the important thing to get

251
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:27,700
a.

252
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,360
Physical idea of what's going on in this process

253
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,780
that can be represented more abstractly and that

254
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:43,400
diagram. This is a good illustration from a

255
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,270
Schroder's textbook introduction of thermal

256
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,600
physics showing these four stages of the current

257
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:54,770
cycle and the specified two for one more piece of

258
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,170
important data that each of those, which is what

259
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,010
exactly is. Happening and what is kept fixed in

260
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,730
each of those cycles, so starting from that

261
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:11,610
smallest volume A, we expand the volume to be. We

262
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,690
have our usual picture here of some ideal gas in a

263
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,930
container with a movable piston that here we are

264
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:24,300
pulling up to increase the volume. Of the of the

265
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,840
gas, and we imagine that we do so. Isothermal is

266
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:33,580
the slow expansion that allows heat to flow in

267
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,480
from that hot reservoir that here is big picture.

268
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:44,300
On the right hand side of the system, so this is a

269
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:50,560
slow expansion from point A to B. Whether that kid

270
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,230
is allowed to flow into the system to keep the

271
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,820
temperature fixed at his age and then going from

272
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,590
point B to C will speed up the expansion so it

273
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,210
becomes much more rapid. And in particular, is

274
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,610
that enough to be idiomatic and see how much of

275
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:16,230
this page I can fit on the screen or keeping it

276
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:22,120
legible and InFocus? That should suffice. So in

277
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,390
this stage. We have a fascinating expansion with

278
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,770
the more heat flow that takes the system to that

279
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:38,310
lower temperature to isoforms, that drew more in

280
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,460
the initial water at an 80 event in a pressure

281
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,820
building diagram. So temperature

282
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,480
in that initial stage I that expansion, trying to

283
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,850
draw things here to make it seem reasonable that

284
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:01,110
the next stage of. Compression going from sea to

285
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,800
team is also isothermal, so we reverse the

286
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,440
direction that this piston is moving, we start

287
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,890
decreasing the volume and we do so slowly enough

288
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:16,320
that heat has a chance to slow out now into that

289
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,920
separates that different core reservoir with a

290
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,010
lower temperature, keeping the volume of the gas,

291
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,160
keeping the temperature of the gas fixed at the

292
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,640
low temperature of that cold reservoir, even as

293
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,820
its volume decreases in this compression. That

294
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:39,940
also is this slow process, expelling kids to that

295
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,860
reservoir into the final process is.

296
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,690
Just analogous to what we were doing before we

297
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,890
speed up the changeability, you still keeping in a

298
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:55,190
depression, ideally to get back to that point A

299
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,030
and now making it fast enough. And it is idiomatic

300
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:05,110
and no further heat is exchanged. And the.

301
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,510
Question to address

302
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,610
what conditions have to be set aside in order to

303
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:20,050
make this cycle a natural cycle that does

304
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,870
successfully get back to its starting point, is a

305
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,500
after going through these four processes

306
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,650
isothermal expansion, adiabatic expansion,

307
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,670
acceptable compression, elevated compression. And

308
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,760
I said on this drawing this diagram, we have

309
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,260
control over this quarter. The volume you can

310
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,760
choose. How much we expanded the system?

311
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,940
Slow and isothermal eighty four point eight will

312
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:59,190
be how much we expanded quickly to see and then

313
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,460
how much we. Depressives both slowly and quickly

314
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,600
to get back to the starting point so we can freely

315
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:15,700
choose the three volumes Einsteinian. Subject to

316
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,430
the constraint that we get from the high

317
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,420
temperature of the horrors of war, what is your

318
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:26,410
Congress at this point? It has to be chosen

319
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:31,080
precisely so that these two processes of

320
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,010
depression lie not in exactly the right way to get

321
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:40,870
us back to our starting point. So if this diagram

322
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,340
if we take these three volumes, that initial

323
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:50,020
pressure. We're only at the initial temperature as

324
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:57,760
given, we should be able to use our four equations

325
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,610
for thermodynamic cycles and the condition that

326
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,930
the cycle closes to predict all of the other

327
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:10,900
aspects of the system as it traverses this time of

328
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,650
the cycle. So those are the four variables I was

329
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,040
describing that we have control over and zoom back

330
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,600
in. Now, that's not trying to keep the

331
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,180
illustration of the page.

332
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,330
It is, as we've seen, these points of the diagram

333
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:35,740
are specifying the temperatures have a free choice

334
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,950
of these three buildings at the initial pressure.

335
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,110
And you want to figure out.

336
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,580
The.

337
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,400
Single correct value of the fourth volume at that

338
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:01,940
point. Video that has to be. Chosen precisely in

339
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,450
order for the cycle to actually be a cycle and

340
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,780
return to its starting point as we go around it

341
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:15,230
and. No apriori, there was no guarantee that this

342
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,930
question could even have a solution for the

343
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,520
current cycle and expect from inspection from the

344
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,730
drawing board and that this will indeed be

345
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,420
possible. For other more complicated systems,

346
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:35,210
there's not necessarily a guarantee that a

347
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,570
collection of thermodynamic processes will be able

348
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:45,900
to form a closed loop in this sort of way. So that

349
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,160
leaves us these. Five unknown quantities that need

350
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:56,050
to be predicted in terms of the four given

351
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,080
quantities as well as the fixed particle number,

352
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,950
so in. And we can do this in a systematic way,

353
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,950
just like around the three point thirty three.

354
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,680
Additional points in the cycle, apart from the

355
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,230
starting point that is completely specified and

356
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,430
making sure that. All of these pressures,

357
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:21,910
temperatures in that final volume are expressible

358
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,810
in terms of the parameters that we have control

359
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:30,130
over. So are there any questions about the overall

360
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,030
set up before we dive into checking that that

361
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,810
computation?

362
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:47,920
New questions. Locally, only locally and. And the

363
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:54,680
starting point then that is actually given here in

364
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,750
the text as it heads in the first stage from HIV,

365
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,480
we know that the temperature remains the same.

366
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,020
This is a thermal expansion. So we find that

367
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:13,600
pressure PCB we just need to set. Or require that

368
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,070
the. Expression for the temperature from the ideal

369
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:23,440
gas law remains the same at point B as it was.

370
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:30,660
That's why have been cancel out having and fix

371
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,340
economic ensembles. This is the ideal gas law

372
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,810
giving us this equation for the fixed temperature

373
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:38,440
related.

374
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,940
The pressure at point B is this. Yes, it is. Sorry

375
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,930
about that.

376
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,160
Hopefully that is fixed that much of a waste of

377
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,190
time, space at points A, B, so the pressure at

378
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,900
points B is proportional to the pressure point

379
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,730
with this factor of personality being the ratios

380
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,280
of the civilians died down correctly this time.

381
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:16,110
And the so I don't see we have. If similar

382
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,380
computations to do for the pressure, but we also

383
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,040
have to.

384
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,700
Figure out of the self-consistent, the way that

385
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:28,870
the low temperature of the cold reservoir that

386
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:34,150
would be consistent with the volume C and the

387
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:40,280
pressure P, C that we've come up with. And at this

388
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:46,410
point, I will. Advertise that the spirit of the

389
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,860
competition is similar to the isothermal stage

390
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,550
from the beat, but going from B to C. We have an

391
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,600
automatic process that fixes the entropy. So

392
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:04,870
instead of using the equal temperatures to derive

393
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,480
our relation between these two points, we can

394
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,700
apply our condition of constant entropy at the

395
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:18,290
Times T to the three power. Is fixed and that.

396
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,330
Points be that.

397
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,110
Expression is the volume of the times, the hot

398
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,570
temperature, the high temperature, the hot

399
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,440
reservoir, and that has to be equal to boiling

400
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:37,820
point sea times, the three horsepower of the low

401
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,420
temperature of the cold reservoir. Now, this

402
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,140
immediately gives us that temperature tell in

403
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:48,410
terms of the parameters we have under our control.

404
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,650
This is, again, proportional to the high

405
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:54,980
temperature, taking the two thirds of power of

406
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,500
both sides of this equation. We now have the

407
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:05,060
personality factor being. This ratio be over VSC

408
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,160
to the two thirds power. And using the ideal gas

409
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,970
law. You can bring in this same expression for

410
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,510
that High-temperature, we get things in terms of

411
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:25,570
the set of variables that we. Said the quantities

412
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,920
we started off with. And high temperatures today

413
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,530
over N. What times this two thirds power of the

414
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:40,480
ratio of the two volumes that we can control?

415
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:54,010
Is there any nomination for. How to go after the

416
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,820
pressure points from. What we have in the spirit

417
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,380
of what's been done so far.

418
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,080
I think in the interest of getting through the

419
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,390
cycle of charging ahead in. I'll tell you one way

420
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,590
to do this, as usual, there are many ways to solve

421
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:30,850
these equations for these unknowns, but one useful

422
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,790
trick for all of you, so that excitement is going

423
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:39,130
to be that the number of particles is fixed and

424
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,040
the ideal gas law relates to that number of

425
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:48,580
particles to be. Three variables that we. And

426
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:52,190
available to us. The pressure, volume and the

427
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:57,870
temperature at that hole, four points in this

428
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,990
cycle. So we were interested in the pressure and

429
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:08,210
volume and see now when the temperature is to low.

430
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,360
This is the same number of particles as the system

431
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,460
we saw off with with this full control times over

432
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,960
that high temperature.

433
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,740
Which then gives us an expression for the pressure

434
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:33,580
point, see as to ratio's. The ratio of the volume

435
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:41,600
here with respect to the A rather than. B b that

436
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,260
we have the temperature in terms of, but we also

437
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,740
have been rated above the low and high

438
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,910
temperatures multiplying on both sides of this

439
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,760
equation by travel and.

440
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,560
The pressure had the starting point A comes along

441
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:04,490
for the ride in that reorganisations. And we can

442
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:11,890
then. Plug in this ratio to low or pretty high, is

443
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,130
this ratio of volume speedy over v.c to the two

444
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:15,840
thirds power?

445
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,580
Give me everything in terms of the quantities that

446
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:29,680
we have control over, just the two factors of the

447
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:35,180
sea separate their. So, again, a pressure

448
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,930
proportional to the pressure of the system now

449
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,410
with two factors of the small hole in the V.P. and

450
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,980
intermediate volume started like this, you see in

451
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,510
the intermediate players B over v.C. So these two

452
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,140
factors are both less than one. We can check that

453
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,040
the pressure has decreased as we've gone halfway

454
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,540
around the cycle consistent with what was shown in

455
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,640
that TV diagram. And similarly.

456
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,760
This ratio here is also less than one confirming

457
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,180
that the low temperature is less than the high

458
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,680
temperature, which is always.

459
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,440
Pleasant to to confirm.

460
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,290
OK, so getting back to point B from Point City, we

461
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:39,500
are now reversing the process of change in volume

462
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:44,660
that allows all possible transfer to proceed. So

463
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,960
not too surprisingly, we can. On.

464
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,950
Use that.

465
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:03,610
Well. There are many ways to do this and maybe the

466
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:10,080
more interesting way to. To ensure that the system

467
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,610
can get back to our target, the starting point of

468
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:18,770
A is to begin with the same. Condition of constant

469
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,160
entropy now connecting those two points deep in a.

470
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,020
To that final debate stage, so we can approach be

471
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,740
from both sides, but thinking about the constant

472
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,420
low temperature that we have from the oppression

473
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,360
as well as the constant entropy that we have to

474
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,440
demand in order to get back to the day after the

475
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,850
final stage of adiabatic expansion. So starting

476
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,850
with that condition, of course, naturally

477
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:55,190
connecting the volume with the high temperature.

478
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,440
Then we have there to the unknown volume and

479
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,790
indeed and the low temperature that it has after

480
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,680
it's isothermal compression.

481
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,750
You find.

482
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,270
The expression for that unknown voting

483
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,240
proportional to the starting point would be a.

484
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:25,840
With this ratio of high poverty low. To the three

485
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,310
house power. And.

486
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:36,930
Up as we went to see. Not too much on the screen,

487
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:42,550
we found this ratio of T high in T low, that's the

488
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:47,530
ratio of the volume is TVB over vasi to the two

489
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,870
thirds power. If we take a two thirds power to the

490
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,800
three has already get the ratio back to power one.

491
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:59,520
And we see that rather than lower high with T

492
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:04,510
higher, pretty low, we just end up with this V a

493
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:12,820
times the inverse of this ratio we see over VEB.

494
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:18,950
Which we can then again check it is larger than

495
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:25,840
the VA as drawing a diagram and we can extract

496
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,580
from this a simple relation between all four of

497
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:35,410
these volumes that specifies uniquely the single

498
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:40,270
special boiardi that you have to choose in order

499
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:45,690
to obtain a. Well, define some of the next cycle,

500
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,970
two products of the volume, eight times I can see

501
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,140
at the top left and right corners of that diagram

502
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:02,100
need to be equal. To the product. Of Beeby and

503
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:05,900
Viji at the top left and bottom right corner of

504
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,620
the diagram.

505
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,920
And then wrapping things up by the last unknown

506
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:23,050
quantity. Pressure would be. And again, news. The.

507
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:28,440
The number of particles in this canonical ideal

508
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:28,960
gas.

509
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:36,730
To get that pressure in terms of quantities, we

510
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:43,110
have already computed some proportional to, I

511
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,940
guess, computed or taken as inputs and then to

512
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:51,850
ratios coming in the ratio of the volumes and the

513
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:59,710
ratio of the temperatures now to low divided by T

514
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:04,950
rather than T high divided by T lowest of. Which

515
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:10,350
if we. But in some of the manipulations down here

516
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,800
from this relation between the four volumes, we

517
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,600
know that the ratio of volumes to here is the same

518
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:26,770
as the ratio of VEB. Over ABC. And some believe

519
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:30,040
from it's just the top of the screen now, the

520
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,000
ratio of low to high temperatures is that same BB

521
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,260
able would be seen to be two thirds power. Which

522
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:44,160
altogether is the initial pressure times the.

523
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,530
Volume ratio from the antibiotic expansion phase

524
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,310
be over the U.S. to the five thirds power. Which.

525
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:00,970
And as expected, is less than the external

526
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:04,500
pressures of the final stage of the impression

527
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:13,060
that you have to start. So these results are

528
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:20,020
useful not only to confirm that the cycle is valid.

529
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,420
We expect more from our ability to draw the line

530
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:31,710
again, but it is also a starting point to. See

531
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,460
what's in practice we can do with this kind of

532
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:41,990
cycle. In terms of how much work, if any, it can

533
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:45,350
do on its surroundings compared to the amount of

534
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:48,710
work that has to be done by the surrounding system

535
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:52,340
and the amount of heat that has to be transferred

536
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,410
between the two. Different thermal reservoirs that

537
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:02,840
the system is in contact with that onto the screen

538
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,000
here. So

539
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,110
it's been a bit slower than I anticipated. What?

540
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,460
Finish answering this question today about the.

541
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,220
Amount of work done by the cycle to be the people

542
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,690
can certainly do the set up of the calculation on

543
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:32,420
Monday and then move on to the next topic, leaving

544
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,610
the ensemble behind. And going on to the grand

545
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:43,750
canonical example as a forecast or preparation. We

546
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:48,040
can say that this question of how much work the

547
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,890
thermodynamic cycle can do on its surroundings

548
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:54,340
compared to the amount of heat that it needs to

549
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,200
run is.

550
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,190
Defined by this concept, known as the efficiency.

551
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,510
Of the third cycle, what specifically if we want

552
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:11,130
our cycle to be an engine that does work by

553
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:17,790
bringing in heat so the efficiency of an engine of

554
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:22,620
this sort is just the ratio of those to quantity,

555
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:25,170
as we were talking about the network that it can

556
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:29,190
do. So the difference between the work it does on

557
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:33,230
its surroundings. With the work that has to be

558
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,710
done on it, subtract it off, divide it by the

559
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:40,640
amount of heat, and it has to bring in from its

560
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,180
surroundings and operate in the second equation

561
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:48,250
here. I have defined a few.

562
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,100
Well, few quantities for convenience just to keep

563
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:58,020
track of negative signs, this in work, in the work

564
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,960
that has to be done on the system by its

565
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:04,800
surroundings compared to the work that is done by

566
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,100
the system of strategies that can be used to turn

567
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:13,560
a wheel and make the bus go forward. So we've seen

568
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,530
that when the surroundings do work on the system,

569
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,760
they reduce the internal energy of that system.

570
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,830
Through the general first law of thermodynamics,

571
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,130
that's the situation when the overall work, the.

572
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:35,250
The negative TV, the computer is positive. So, for

573
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:40,040
example, a decrease in the volume. Requires that

574
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,250
the system requires that the surroundings to work

575
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:47,270
on the system to a positive overall work that will

576
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:53,070
call this work in. And keep everything positive.

577
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,000
So all four of these parties are going to be

578
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,200
defined to be positive when the system does work

579
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:07,740
on its surroundings, its. Using energy that it has

580
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,010
to do something useful outside itself, so it's

581
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,700
lowering its own internal energy, corresponding to

582
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,830
a negative value for the overall work Miles, to do.

583
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:25,680
Output work, which we will. Defined to be positive,

584
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,380
is that just the negative of that overall quality

585
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,950
of work that we've defined, minus so many changes,

586
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,690
is positive. You can expect work to be done by the

587
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,480
system of the surroundings. And this is the if you

588
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,040
want the absolute value of that work by carefully

589
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,670
choosing the negative signs to keep everything

590
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:55,360
positive. And there's a similar story with a cheap

591
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,770
flowing into and out of the system. When he was in

592
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,640
Mishu, equal to temperature type situation,

593
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,910
entropy is positive to raise the control of the

594
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:11,700
system. It flows out that times change and entropy

595
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,480
is negative. And we define the kids with the waste

596
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,550
heat that is expelled to be the negative then of

597
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:24,800
the overall heat exchange. Now, we defined earlier

598
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,270
this week, so that gives us the second quality in

599
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:33,230
this equation. Sixty four at the efficiency is the

600
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,830
network done by the system. So how much would you

601
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:40,540
put out into its surroundings, minus how much work

602
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:44,940
had to be done to it as input? All normalized by

603
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:50,680
the amount of Keat. That has to flow into the

604
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,620
system, so the total amount of heat that flows in

605
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:57,550
making no reference to any heat that might flow

606
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:04,930
out. In the case of the engine, we are going to be

607
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,050
interested in the situations where that network is

608
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,260
positive, where work is done by the system that

609
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:14,710
has to be done to it in order for it to operate

610
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:23,590
with both cue in. The inflow keeps and this work

611
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:28,120
done, being positive, the quantities, the ratio is

612
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,640
also positive. So the efficiency that we've

613
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,830
defined here is. Always a positive, never strictly

614
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:36,370
positive.

615
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:43,250
And from the first of the millennium, we can

616
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,830
actually place an upper bound on how efficient a

617
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:54,950
heat engine can possibly be. So that's the.

618
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,990
Overstate this to to wrap up. And the calculation

619
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,950
is fairly simple, one showed here an equation

620
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:11,240
sixty five where we know that because the system

621
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,230
is returning to its initial from an erratic state,

622
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:19,100
by the definition of a cycle that gets back to the

623
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,100
starting point, we know that all of the energy

624
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,790
flow into the system has to balance out around

625
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:31,160
each of these cycles. So the net amount of heat

626
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,340
that flows into the system compared to that which

627
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,610
flows out, plus the amount of work done on the

628
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:40,420
system compared to the amount of work it does, has

629
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:46,220
to all cancel out to zero. So that the work done,

630
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:50,030
this difference between the output work, minus the

631
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:50,720
input work,

632
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,930
can be no larger than the input amount of heat

633
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:59,620
that is equal to the difference between the heat

634
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:04,600
flowing in and the heat going out. And that is

635
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:09,820
itself a not negative quantity, I suppose all of

636
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:14,300
these equations here I should have had. Less than

637
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:16,960
an hour greater than or equal to science, because

638
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,680
it's possible to have varnishing work. Or

639
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,250
banishing heat flow, as we've seen in the current

640
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:30,070
cycle. In other words, the. Efficiency, the ratio

641
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:35,380
of this network divided by the heat can be no

642
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:42,030
larger than one. And this occurs when Kuis out is

643
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,540
equal to zero and there is no way to get expelled,

644
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:49,870
so. This is sometimes phrased as the statement

645
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:52,360
that the first of all of the attacks means you

646
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,440
can't win in a heat cycle, you can get no more

647
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,530
work out of the cycle then the amount of heat that

648
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:03,830
has to be put into it in order for it to operate.

649
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:09,460
So I'll wrap up there. You have time for any final

650
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:14,770
questions about this setup, work and efficiency.

651
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:21,400
And otherwise, obviously, some of you and possibly

652
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,910
more back this afternoon will look a bit more

653
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,950
detail at mixing, mixing entropy and the question

654
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:32,260
of thermodynamics.

655
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,800
According to.
