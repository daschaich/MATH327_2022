1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,230
Well, there are the bells marking the hour, so we'll

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:14,260
start getting underway, first with that usual six-digit number for you to plug in:

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:26,710
three nine one, six two eight.  I'll leave that up there.

4
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,220
Welcome back to week four and

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,890
hopefully a bit better weather over the coming few

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,110
days than over the last few.

7
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:47,600
In terms of logistics, we have

8
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:50,770
on the twenty-

9
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:53,690
first

10
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,290
of February

11
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,160
I can mention that as it is weuk four, that week-three

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,720
mini-questionnaire has run its course. So

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,710
thanks for all of you who sent in feedback and

14
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,460
information about how things are going on there.

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,170
The consensus seems to be that there are no major

16
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,140
issues with this module, at least so far. The

17
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,570
average feeling was the pace was just a little

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,070
faster than slow. Difficulty was a little more

19
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,550
difficult than easy, which is about the level I

20
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,210
think is appropriate for a math three hundred

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,170
level module. To be more interesting was the

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,970
homework assignment that I was using to try to get

23
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,360
the focus on this projector there. So that is now.

24
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,510
Available on canvas, due a week from Thursday, the

25
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:58,890
end of March 3rd May. Spend some time looking at

26
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,650
that in the editorial this Friday. What else we

27
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:08,010
have to. Entertain ourselves with may also look at

28
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,080
the. First part of the computer project, if the

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,940
issues showed up there as I go through that

30
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,090
marking, which may or may not be completed at that

31
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,600
point. And I should say there was some interesting

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
discussion over the weekend revisiting some of the

33
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,900
topics we were talking about over the past couple

34
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,860
of weeks in terms of how there is moves, large

35
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,030
scale macroscopic behavior emerges from the equal

36
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,720
probability of all the various micro states in the

37
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,670
canonical ensemble. Are there any questions from

38
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,490
anyone here about that or any other topics we've

39
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,040
seen so far?

40
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,760
Just as a reminder, a quick recap of where we are

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,520
right now, and we will be going to the focus on

42
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,620
the canonical ensemble last week.

43
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:16,280
This is. The approach, this statistical ensemble

44
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,300
that we get, if we are able to fix the temperature

45
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,810
and the number of degrees of freedom in our system,

46
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,310
and we went through somewhat detailed mathematical

47
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,120
justification for how the temperature can be fixed

48
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,440
even while being the first law of thermodynamics

49
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,490
concerning the total energy of the universe. By

50
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,520
coupling the system to enlarge, the reservoir

51
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,070
imposes that fixed temperature. And one of the key

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,450
outcomes of that mathematical derivation was the

53
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,800
definition of the precision function for the

54
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,360
canonical ensemble condition called Z, which sums

55
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,980
over all of the microstates of the system. And

56
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,840
this so-called Boltzmann's factor, the exponential

57
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,760
of negative data times the energy of that micro

58
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,030
state where beta is. Something we identify with

59
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,010
the inverse temperature, all of this in

60
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:26,630
thermodynamic equilibrium obtained by maximizing

61
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,140
the entropy, we zoom out and hope that things

62
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,780
remain. Visible, this thinking.

63
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,150
From this Patricia function, there is so called

64
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,010
free energy specifically attributed to Helmholtz,

65
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,580
which pulls out of the.

66
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,430
Logo of Z times, the negative temperature, which

67
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,290
provides them some compact expressions for drive

68
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,350
quality, is an economical approach, including the

69
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,250
average internal energy, which is no longer fixed

70
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,210
thanks to thermal contact with the large thermal

71
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,020
reservoir. This is a derivative with respect to

72
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:24,150
beat a bit at times F and eventually. Which is the

73
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,360
negative derivative derivative with respect to

74
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,260
temperature of that free energy and by itself and

75
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,240
what we are doing today is looking at these

76
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,040
particular observable derived quantities in two

77
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,790
similar situations that will differ only by the

78
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:51,620
amount of information that is. Present is is

79
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,050
knowable in principle in the systems we are

80
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,680
looking at.

81
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,090
This is where we left off last time we started

82
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,400
looking at the behavior of spins and I saw our

83
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,150
usual two state degrees of freedom spin's pointing

84
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,450
out we're down the mathematics of the coins and

85
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:18,640
energy given by coupling to an external magnetic

86
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,850
field of strength. Pinche.

87
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,810
Wonder if

88
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:27,950
was

89
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,830
once a

90
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,000
little

91
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,230
more.

92
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,000
Maybe just a little speak up if anything is clear,

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,230
to see if you need to clarify whatever is up there

94
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,720
are looking first. And so it's been six and

95
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,160
astounded that we can distinguish from one another

96
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,640
by looking at their position in the summer. They

97
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,480
basically have an address that experimenter can

98
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,160
focus on in order to tell which STEM is pointing

99
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,280
up, which is pointing down the precision function.

100
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,420
Our starting point with the approach is that the

101
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,300
sum over all possible orientations of all and of

102
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:32,280
the system. Which ends up boiling down to a fairly

103
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,370
compact expression, two times the hyperbolic

104
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,210
cosine of the dimensionless, a bit at times the

105
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,270
magnetic field strength divided by the temperature,

106
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,350
all of that with the overall factor of. Negative

107
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:52,360
temperature or negative on the health reality,

108
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,020
then? Brings in the logarithm of that molecules of

109
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,970
the power and with that overall factor of

110
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:07,730
temperature that I was jumping ahead to. So we

111
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,280
pick up from here, we are basically left in the

112
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:17,140
position of. Carrying out. A. Few quick

113
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,630
computations to extract the observers that we want,

114
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,900
starting with. The energy.

115
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:36,140
Let's see. How this derivative. She was up on the

116
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,390
projector. This is hopeless, I may have switched

117
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,070
you up on the board at the expense of the

118
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,250
recording, possibly having a harder time capturing

119
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,880
things on.

120
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,710
You're taking, as I mentioned, to recap the

121
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,650
derivative with respect to the temperature of the

122
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,500
times. So the overall factor would be the

123
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,740
consistent whatever data and we are left with that

124
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:08,070
constant negative end up front and then data. But

125
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,220
the more the rhythm of the hyperbolic cosine of

126
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,710
the H, they're just churning through the chain

127
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:24,470
rule. The arguments in the water rhythm comes down

128
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,330
to the denominator. Synecdoche. Get agent and

129
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,540
chamber will takes the derivative. Of the argument,

130
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,460
the water in which is twice the hyperbolic sign of

131
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,610
an age. And finally, the derivative of the

132
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,580
argument of that sign with respect to data is just

133
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,050
an additional factor of age.

134
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:55,790
Was canceled and we are left with minus in times

135
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,180
age with the, of course, being that hyperbolic.

136
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,410
Tangent. Of Bayridge.

137
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,300
So it looks like the.

138
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,920
Exonerating art is more valuable than the text,

139
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,920
since you can check that text in the PDF a printed

140
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,190
copies. You have what really should be good to

141
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,930
proceed. So we have the energy for these

142
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,880
distinguishable stains or the average internal

143
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,260
energy being negative and types of fuel, strange

144
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,360
types of hyperbolic tangents of middle age. And

145
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,390
from this we can pretty much immediately write

146
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,340
down the entropy that is always related to the

147
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,810
average internal energy. Minus the Helmholtz free

148
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,260
energy, but multiply it by an overall factor of

149
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,930
inverse temperature. So there are just two terms

150
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,760
here, baiba times.

151
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,800
Minus 10, the range that we have from the energy

152
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:11,050
and then the better times this negative and want

153
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:18,280
to caution each of the three energy. So you have

154
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,360
these two challenges.

155
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,070
Hyperbolic charges, plus the water with the

156
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:31,560
otherwise hyperbolic. Cosine. Which is a bit

157
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:37,290
awkward. You look like an idiot. This is how those

158
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,120
functions look if we normalize by those three

159
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,990
factors. So both internal energy and entropy are

160
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,300
extensive quantities so we can divide through by

161
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,280
the number of degrees of freedom in the system and

162
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,930
and also normalize the energy by that external

163
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,190
magnetic field strength. So that is the limit of.

164
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,640
Zero temperature, it reduces two to one, I should

165
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,590
say, divided by just plain numbers to appear on

166
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,740
these vertical axis and similarly this horizontal

167
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,450
axis is that. Ratio of temperature and magnetic

168
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,220
field strength to your average is one over the age.

169
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,960
So as the temperature goes to zero, we have data

170
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,690
heading to infinity and as the temperature itself

171
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:42,510
and the inverse goes to zero, the. Way to proceed

172
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,440
and start making sense of these complicated

173
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,000
equations for energy and entropy in terms of

174
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:55,800
tensions and clashes and so on, is to extract the

175
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,150
asymptotic behavior and the approach to

176
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,000
the temperature. And as I started to say, as we

177
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,890
take that temperature to zero and lot debate that

178
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,490
goes off to infinity, that both the Cinching Kosh

179
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,450
approach to the X, the ratio of them is detached,

180
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,450
which approaches one. There's a nice and that

181
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,440
leaves us with negative one with the energy in

182
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,960
that low temperature limit where bid age becomes

183
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,210
very large. And this, of course, corresponds to

184
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,070
exactly that same energy that. We computed with

185
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,520
Biggie about systems previously, all of the skins

186
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,850
here are aligned with the magnetic field or

187
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:55,160
contributing a negative unit of light of speech to

188
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,700
the energy. So this Grasset Energy is the stage

189
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,730
that we divide out to the.

190
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,130
And we also saw that real estate energy at the

191
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:11,170
ground state is a single microstates. So it is

192
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:16,090
reasonable to see that the entropy at the top of

193
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,260
this page here is heading to zero, which

194
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,440
corresponds to the the logarithm of what we can

195
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,640
see this from that complicated expression in terms

196
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,600
of consciousness, Wongs of Koshetz, that's what we

197
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,310
saw the potential as to one, the water rhythm of

198
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,090
twice hyperbolic cosine approaches, just the water

199
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:44,410
rhythm of that E to the H, which is Bureij and the

200
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,960
relative negative side, three, two times cancel.

201
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,050
Confirming our intuition that if a single

202
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,380
microstates in the ground state, we had an

203
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,670
Entropia on zero.

204
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,400
So that at least narrows down the asymptotic low

205
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,940
temperature limit, what is called. Absolutely zero,

206
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,810
where generally the statistical systems freeze in

207
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,950
a single micro states with management effort. And

208
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,850
again, this is a key feature of the economic cycle

209
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,340
where we can adjust this temperature and get the

210
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:28,760
energy as a driver observable rather than focusing

211
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,530
on the energy and extracting the temperature the

212
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,840
way we did the microeconomics case. We can build

213
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,960
on. It's just this somewhat trivial limit of

214
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,360
absolute zero with a single microstates and

215
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,600
entropy, by considering how the system approaches

216
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,830
that that limits for a little bit non-zero

217
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,240
temperatures there. And the canonical approach are

218
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,200
bowsman factor.

219
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:03,880
Either the mindless energy over you is now no

220
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:10,170
longer just zero for any. System by the state,

221
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,590
except for the lowest energy ground state, we have

222
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,460
this non-zero probability of finding the system.

223
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:23,330
In some of those higher energy microstates, the

224
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:29,880
first of which we looked at again back in Unit two.

225
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,630
So about this time last we saw that just putting a

226
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,290
single spin in this extraordinary field led to the

227
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:43,000
next available energy. Of minus eight times and

228
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,670
minus two. Where this is going to be called in

229
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,800
terminology, I may use to think of the first

230
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,940
excited state where the states are being talked

231
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,590
about here are different from the microstates. So

232
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:04,410
any particular. Energy state, energy level. Try to

233
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,670
call it in correspondence, you will be realized by

234
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,900
many different micro states in these statistical

235
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,800
systems. And in the case of certain systems, at

236
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:22,950
least all of these energy levels are going to be

237
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,360
I'm going to differ from each other by the same

238
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,600
procedure, we just put one more spin to align

239
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,080
against the magnetic field, increasing the overall

240
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,490
energy by two units out of the total. And so the

241
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,840
energy gap between every pair of subsequence

242
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,210
energy levels is this constant factor of two times

243
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:53,060
that it feels right. We also did see back in. In

244
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,620
Unit two. So.

245
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,840
With that said, that reminder of how all of our

246
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,680
microstates.

247
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,700
Or falling into energy levels with a constant

248
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,550
spacing between them. We can.

249
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,670
Consider this limit of low, but nonzero

250
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,800
temperature is a bit age is not infinite, but it

251
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,770
is much larger than one, which means that this

252
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,250
exponential, either the minus beta age that's

253
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,540
appearing in these Courchesne attaches is a very

254
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:34,930
small number that we can use. A consistent

255
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:42,050
expansion, so. Just to see how that works. We'll

256
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,990
break down again the result that we have, that

257
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:51,530
energy we divide up and we're just left with the

258
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:58,630
negative hyperbolic tangent. A better age. Which

259
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,730
is the negative ratio of simulcasts, the one minus.

260
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,980
This exponential factor E to the minus, to the age

261
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,830
of the one plus exponential growth needed to be at

262
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,250
age.

263
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,660
Which if we expand in the geometric series, one

264
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,610
over one plus X is approximately equal to one plus

265
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:30,440
X plus X squares of the numerator comes along for

266
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:30,920
the ride.

267
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,780
And that denominator expands to approximately one

268
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:43,380
minus E minus tumed H plus quarter of this small

269
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,740
number squared, which would be of the minus four

270
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,130
of H, which will neglect for now. So is that

271
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,620
approach, that calculation fairly familiar, the

272
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,300
expansion of one of the one four six as this power

273
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,350
series of X?

274
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:12,160
There are. No objections that I see, and at this

275
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,560
point, all that remains is.

276
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,980
Expanding this productive terms, so we have an

277
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,510
overall minus one out front and then two factors

278
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,290
of minus E to the minus to the age coming from the

279
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:32,010
cross turns the negative up front. That's a plus

280
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:39,530
to. Even to. In an age, I'll just leave it there,

281
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,300
neglect the higher order, temperature dependent

282
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:50,760
terms I can identify. This twice the age as the

283
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:56,130
energy gap, so we recover that asymptotic absolute

284
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,000
zero limit of the energy in these units

285
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,920
approaching negative one, and then we see that for

286
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,450
small but not zero temperatures. It.

287
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,810
Increases, there's a positive contribution that is

288
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,800
exponentially suppressed by the energy gap

289
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,570
compared to this low temperature. And this results

290
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:29,570
here matches up and should. Still a contract of.

291
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,990
The level at which we start collecting turns.

292
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,450
So we reproduce a result, we were targeting that.

293
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,360
He's excited to see the effects, so the influence

294
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,470
on the energy of our system from microstates other

295
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,440
than the grounds to include higher energy use are

296
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,730
exponentially suppressed in the face of the energy

297
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,730
gap between these energy levels and that. Turns

298
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,430
out to be a generic feature of economical systems

299
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,650
with a non-zero energy gap.

300
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,640
And at least the qualitative quantitative

301
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,000
calculation that you have extracted, all of it,

302
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,190
admitting that having gone through that we can

303
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:23,940
recognize this exponential dependence as.

304
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,340
Consistent with or being motivated by the

305
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,270
exponential Boltzmann factor that is appearing in

306
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:38,620
the probabilities. So it's probably going to be

307
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:45,340
proportional to the minus stuff I look at ratios

308
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,560
and probabilities. It is that's a difference

309
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,560
between the energies that comes out from the

310
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,880
properties of the exponential.

311
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,570
We can show you the. Same sort of calculation

312
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,690
expansion for. The entropy.

313
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:11,430
And this here, if we divide by then, is that a

314
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:17,820
factor of better over at times the internal energy

315
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,270
we just computed, minus the number three energy?

316
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:28,230
So putting in the expansion that we have been over

317
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:36,310
and for the energy was minus one, plus two each,

318
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:42,530
the minus beta energy gap, plus border either

319
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,630
minus two. Beta energy, gamma.

320
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:52,630
And the parenthesis did not go there have to.

321
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:03,110
Subtract the three hours, which was minus one,

322
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,950
plus one over Beita for sorry, it over Beda times,

323
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:13,550
that logarithm of my standing on the screen twice.

324
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:20,720
Hyperbolic, cosine h there is the other end of

325
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,650
that parenthesis, so you've already done the

326
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,130
expansion for one of these factors, the expansion

327
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,640
for the free energy. This is the one.

328
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:42,140
Twice the hyperbolic cosine of age, if we. Cloud

329
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,250
the E to the plus the age factor from the

330
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,220
definition of hyperbolic cosine. You're left with

331
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:57,240
one plus E to the minus to be the H. And then

332
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,510
distributing the law, the of a product is the sum

333
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,790
of the logs in the blink of an exponential is just

334
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:08,490
its arguments. So this equals B, the H plus the

335
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:14,070
logarithm of one, plus our small number, which we

336
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,660
can expand already as that small number is a minus

337
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,950
Tubin H plus order, that small number squared

338
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,170
minus four to eight, which is also where our

339
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,370
expansion to the energy.

340
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:36,860
When we start churning out terms, so putting all

341
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,810
of these. Together and the expression of love we

342
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:48,790
have. At the end over in. Is. I would have.

343
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,620
You have the missing factor.

344
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,700
Each because without have the expression up here

345
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,230
is the energy divided by at a time stage here, we

346
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:21,180
just want. Energy over and cancel those games in

347
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:27,370
overall factor of age there and there. So now I'm

348
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,620
happier with the units on this expression.

349
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,260
Kim. S..

350
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,840
That was minus one here is kids better divided by

351
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,650
its bitter. And then I have.

352
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,480
Two terms here.

353
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,400
A minus or sorry, a.

354
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,150
Close to each, Peter.

355
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:21,760
Times E to the minus, to Delta E from the

356
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,450
expansion of the energy and then just to the

357
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,470
radiation that you can convince them to be only.

358
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,960
The single E to the minus two bit H e from the

359
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,990
free energy and then all of the other terms and

360
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,250
order to the minus to.

361
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:50,210
Beta of the energy here, is that what you want to

362
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,740
define is to each. Is the energy out there to be

363
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,710
useful of the

364
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,770
things we said to their terms that we have to get

365
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:07,850
them all exponentially suppressed the energy gap

366
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,570
compared to an absolute zero limit on the

367
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,200
vanishing entropy, the one of these exponentially

368
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,090
suppressed terms has a slight counteracting effect

369
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:26,890
from the non zero. They will delta itself, which

370
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,490
is not going to change the quality of the behavior

371
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:35,160
of the functions. You can see going back to. These

372
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,610
plots showing them that low energy, there's both

373
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,410
this exponentially fast approach to the symbolic

374
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:48,300
limits, despite the different prefectures in both

375
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:54,780
cases. So that is. What we can learn about the low

376
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:01,420
temperature of bit of this system of distinguished

377
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,910
hospitals, the. Are there questions out there

378
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,480
about the calculations that should get a bit messy

379
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,340
going through the mind or about the.

380
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,940
The quality of. Information to take away that an

381
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,100
exponentially fast conversions to the limit of

382
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,790
absolute zero in terms of the energy gap between

383
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,140
subsequent energy levels, the system.

384
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,510
Moving on to forget the other one that we have in

385
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,950
here, where the temperature goes to infinity,

386
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,880
which corresponds to the ground zero. This one

387
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,550
will turn out to be a bit more straightforward and

388
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:00,750
less messy. This is high temperatures, but not

389
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:08,010
infinitely high temperatures where now these low

390
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,360
parameter that we can work with is exactly the

391
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,010
speed of age itself. As the temperature becomes,

392
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:17,160
margins of risk become small. And for the internal

393
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,940
energy we have to do is the usual Taylor series

394
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,700
expansion provided its. I've been a bit of the

395
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,680
leading term state agent and plus one third the

396
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,320
human factor, and we can expect things to come the

397
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,680
full power of the age. And as the temperature goes

398
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:44,270
to infinity, this term goes like minus H over T

399
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,690
varnishing. Like one over tea, which is in fact

400
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:54,890
what we saw in the Michael Campbell case when we

401
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:58,400
fixed the temperature predicted and we fixed the

402
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,550
energy predicted, the temperature coming from the

403
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:08,440
independence of the entropy of the energy. We saw

404
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:14,380
that. The temperature very like minus teenage

405
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:20,310
poverty, and as the energy went to zero, the

406
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:23,310
temperature diverged and the same thing is going

407
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,830
on here. The energy is vanishing as the

408
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,890
temperature, but it's the same relationships with

409
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:33,450
the role of dependent and independent variables

410
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:34,950
clipped

411
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:42,720
into the entropy. You can start off with that same.

412
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:51,740
Calculation, I'll go ahead and distribute the as

413
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:56,600
it is to the energy and the free energy in this

414
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,450
expression so that it's easier to keep track of

415
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:07,960
them. Just as before you plug in. The. Expansion

416
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,710
for the High-temperature energy here, there is

417
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:17,000
another factor of. Each to account for the overall

418
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,930
factor of data. So the first term we have minus

419
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:31,760
data squared and then the next term disappeared a

420
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:38,900
few times at age times, data over. And and is

421
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:42,510
accounted for. I'll just call it something of

422
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:50,630
order given to the 4th began just days before the

423
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:56,660
the over the free energy. Is just the horn of

424
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,950
twice the hyperbolic cosine. We're doing a

425
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:08,120
different expansion of the arguments of this law

426
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,670
and the limits where Bureij becomes very small,

427
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,900
all of the very large hyperbolic cosine has its

428
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,530
usual.

429
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,660
Power, serious expansion. You can pull off this

430
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,030
particular factor of the one, two plus. One of the

431
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,930
court itself, which we know is one plus 1/2 times

432
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:41,730
its arguments squared, plus order of the argument

433
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,980
to the fourth power.

434
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:52,720
Which we can then expand the log log of one plus a

435
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,540
small number is at the beginning of that small

436
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:04,360
number itself getting up to be age to the fourth.

437
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:10,440
So putting these terms together, the interview

438
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:17,690
ends up with a. One or two, and then plus one half

439
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:21,980
billion squared, minus eight squared, leaves us

440
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:28,010
with a negative one half. It declared in the

441
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,410
corrections. An ordinary village to the fourth

442
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:34,340
power.

443
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:42,800
Which is what is written below and. You see, that

444
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,730
has happened here goes to infinity and zero. This

445
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:54,440
approach is this constant value of two, which is

446
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,440
where it is heading to. Up on the screen, you're.

447
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,380
Check the numerical value matches up. With the

448
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:13,520
election there. Which is, in fact, exactly what we

449
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,960
can recognize for. The microeconomic ensemble of

450
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,650
all to the end of the microstates in the system

451
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,460
had the same energy and the entropy would just be

452
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,050
the of the debt and more to what we have here in

453
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:36,380
the a temperature regime. So we actually see the

454
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,370
canonical and canonical ensembles coming together

455
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:44,600
in this way, which we can interpret positively as.

456
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:50,560
The energy's coming from these experience,

457
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,850
interacting with that external metallic feel,

458
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:57,440
albeit negligible compared to the temperature. So

459
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,790
effectively, the system behaves as though every

460
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:06,140
microstates had the same energy independent of how

461
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,630
it spins for aligned compared to that external

462
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:09,860
fuel. The

463
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,100
technology neglected compared to the water

464
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,490
temperature that.

465
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,990
So that is. How all of these drives qualities

466
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:27,590
behave already for reasons of

467
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,930
temperature for the case, the distinction is

468
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:36,380
better solved. Well, if we have enough time, we

469
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,990
want to do that same sort of thing for

470
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:44,510
indistinguishable spins in the middle, which will

471
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:48,340
be distinguishable by virtue of being in a gas of

472
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:53,270
spin. So the idea here comes a pause. As for any

473
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,430
final questions about the distinguishable case.

474
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,600
And move on to the contrast, so we are considering

475
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,740
nearly the same setup we have and spins into a

476
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,500
dynamic equilibrium, get an external magnetic

477
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,320
field of strength, each that determines the energy

478
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:20,920
of any configuration of these spins. Only now

479
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,960
rather than. Identifying these things with sea

480
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,090
molecules in a solid position is fixed and can be

481
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:31,480
identified and distinguished from each other. We

482
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,750
said that the spoons are free to move as though

483
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:38,200
they were particles in a one dimensional gas.

484
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:44,520
And we will assume that need movement that they're

485
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,570
doing is slow so that the energy continues to be

486
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,960
defined by their interactions with this magnetic

487
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,420
field and in the kinetic energy that they have is

488
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:58,310
negligible. So when we look at them, you will just

489
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,410
see the same sort of.

490
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,920
Google stands in that extra room in Edgefield.

491
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,870
The difference being compared to the

492
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,700
distinguishable case, we can't reliably say that.

493
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,900
If we look at the second and third steps here and

494
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:29,970
we look back whether the second and third spins

495
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,060
are still in the same positions that they were

496
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,850
before, we can keep track of where these things

497
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:38,310
are. They can move freely past each other. And.

498
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:43,790
There's no way to assign a label to them or know

499
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,230
that by looking at a particular position in this

500
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,960
line, we will pick out a particular step.

501
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:58,960
So what we have to do in this case, as always, is

502
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:04,700
start by computing the petition function, which is

503
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,460
a set of goals and factors over all the

504
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:12,920
microstates of the system. And the question now is,

505
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,780
what are the microstates of the system? What we

506
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:23,240
can no longer distinguish between. Cases where a

507
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,450
certain spin is pointing a certain way versus

508
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,060
another has been pointed the same way since May

509
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,150
well have been indistinguishable and the

510
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,910
microstates side cannot pretend that we have

511
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,630
information. About which is pointing which way.

512
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,870
In other words, because the spins on this motion,

513
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:49,320
all the federations. Also are indistinguishable,

514
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,220
at least in the case. That they have the same

515
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:58,380
energy or the same number of downward would spins.

516
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,010
So we saw this the beginning of this year, but you

517
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:07,510
get the replica. To configurations of spins, one

518
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:13,060
up and one down. And the order in which one is up,

519
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,240
one is down can no longer be distinguished. So

520
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,380
both of those configurations are a single

521
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,190
microstates.

522
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:29,840
The. Solution to how to cut electricity or

523
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,210
something. I actually said already in that little

524
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:36,290
spiel, just what we can distinguish is the total

525
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:40,070
number of operating expenses corresponding to the

526
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:45,170
total energy, which is now the only way we are

527
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:50,060
able to identify which micro state is which. Each

528
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,660
micro state has a one to one correspondence with

529
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,450
the energy that comes from how many schemes are

530
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,850
pointing out versus how many are down.

531
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,000
So.

532
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,970
We can organize all of these microstates in order

533
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:12,260
to take the sun in the petition function just by.

534
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:19,760
Enumerating the materials that are available, do a

535
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,030
quick example with just four foreskins should be

536
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,810
true enough to fit in this gap. And in the time

537
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:28,940
that remains

538
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:36,570
where. The microstates that we have to respond to

539
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:41,060
the five values that the energy of these this

540
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,020
Forssmann system can take to the ground, state

541
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:48,180
energy is minus four times age and there is a

542
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,890
constant energy gap between all of the higher

543
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:58,470
energy levels that electricity with that

544
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,160
corresponds to energy minus to two energy, zero

545
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,120
energy plus to age with a higher energy state that

546
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,790
has plus four age and.

547
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:15,830
Out of the possible spin configurations, in this

548
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,570
case, keeping the magnetic field, pointing out

549
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,590
that the ground state is all for spins aligned

550
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:25,220
with its highest energy state. Somebody has, of

551
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,540
course, been RNC aligned. And with each higher

552
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,050
energy level, one of those spins is flipped and we

553
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:38,750
cannot. Distinguish between. We cannot determine

554
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,670
which stand is flat because they are

555
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,030
indistinguishable, so all the permutations of that

556
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,760
collapse to a single microstates.

557
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,140
And similarly. As we have.

558
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,980
Two or three spins pointing down.

559
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:06,300
So some of these microstates you can simulate some

560
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:11,340
of these energy values, the state energy plus the

561
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:15,700
energy gap time, some integer, which, you know,

562
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:22,020
ranges from zero. We have the real state up to an

563
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:27,150
inclusive for that highest energy state. So this

564
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:30,900
gives us and plus one that total microstates for

565
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,280
any particles imaginable where you can have the

566
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,190
partition function for these indistinguishable

567
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:43,770
particles. Is the sun over those endless one

568
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:49,380
bowsman factors, even the better times and minus

569
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:54,750
Tulk? Which if we pull out that constables would

570
00:43:54,750 --> 00:44:01,020
refactor it to the end of each. We can. Recognize

571
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:06,420
that this is the seed of the virus to their age is

572
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,090
the fixed quantity to the virus, to their age

573
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:13,860
raised to the cave power to destroy the sun, which

574
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:19,520
turns out to be. A ratio of this exponential one

575
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:25,480
minus. Even minus two times, that was one bit over

576
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,470
one minus due to the minus two. So this is another

577
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,920
manifestation of that symmetric series that popped

578
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,670
up in the case of distinguishable stands, one over

579
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,230
one minus X, at least one X is less than one is

580
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:47,500
for this exponential. That is equal to the sum of

581
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,970
powers to the K from K to infinity. And the fact

582
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:55,510
that this song has to be cut off to our total

583
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:59,020
number of particles just means that we saw or

584
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:04,510
subtract the similar song from Kate, ranging from

585
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:09,430
Air Force One up to infinity if we extract an axe

586
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:12,810
to the end of this one. From that second summer,

587
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,510
get another geometric series just with that

588
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:21,130
overall factor of the year plus one leading to an

589
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,210
equation for.

590
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:29,480
So.

591
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:36,210
I think I will try to speed through the rest of

592
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,690
this unit in the few remaining minutes, there's a

593
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:43,260
quick exercise to take the logarithm of this

594
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,010
equation. Forty four, which will bring in three

595
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,200
terms corresponding to the three factors being

596
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,310
multiplied, multiplied by each other. And on that

597
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:56,670
homework assignment that's now available. You can.

598
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,210
Take this towards free energy through the

599
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:05,590
calculation to determine that internal energy and

600
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:10,420
entropy and the high temperature limits so we can

601
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:16,450
look at to wrap things up today, here is how the

602
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,880
results that you're going after compare with the

603
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:22,360
case of distinguishable particles that we spent a

604
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,300
fair amount of time computing in some detail. So

605
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,440
for the energy normalized by the end times, it

606
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:36,490
gets the same. Temperature over H. The story lines.

607
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,360
Are the same distinguishable results that we

608
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:43,960
disputed in some detail already in the solid blue

609
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,980
line is now the indistinguishable result coming

610
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:51,320
from this new setup where the spinners are. I

611
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,340
guess I can move freely through each other, what

612
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,740
we can see is that although the. Zero temperature

613
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:04,580
limit of absolute zero is the same. As soon as the

614
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:09,440
temperature is not zero a. Clearly observable

615
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,900
difference in this observable quantity of.

616
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:18,930
And. Even though there is still exponential

617
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,240
approach to that after the zero minutes.

618
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,340
There is a measurable or an observable difference

619
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:33,330
in the energy of these systems, depending solely

620
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:36,000
on their information content, whether the spirits

621
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,450
are distinguishable. And maybe the most striking

622
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:44,650
difference is. What happens with the entropy

623
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,990
normalize by in high temperatures, where if we

624
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:53,980
recall that for the distinguishable case, this was

625
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:59,560
approaching? The logarithm of two. And what is

626
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:06,390
happening? In the. In this case, there's actually

627
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,680
an approach to.

628
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:20,280
The. Voyeurism of an endless one over in. By and

629
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,860
so even in the. Have some high your limit with the

630
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,350
energy's all come together.

631
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,380
For the same reason that the temperature dominates

632
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,660
and the system is essentially microeconomic, all

633
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:40,790
items are. There is a exponentially smaller number

634
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:44,690
of microstates leading to the suppress entropy for

635
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,070
the in this case.

636
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:53,550
In. The conclusion takeaway here is you have

637
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:59,310
rushed through a bit of the second calculation is

638
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:04,590
just that. For two physical systems, identical in

639
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:07,800
all aspects except their information, contact with

640
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,350
their hands are distinguishable or not in

641
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:16,210
principle. Was it measurable, physical difference

642
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,410
in the internal energy? Or in other words,

643
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:26,530
information is physical. Which is the takeaway

644
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:30,070
message provided by physicist Wolf Landauer just a

645
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:33,350
few decades ago, so this investigation is about

646
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:39,770
information in physics is recent. And even ongoing

647
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:45,840
research. That shows up even in the simple case of

648
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:51,090
the spin systems that we're using as our most

649
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,320
basic example. So.

650
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,270
I will stop there for today. Next time is of the

651
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:01,870
essence of generalizing from. This week's belongs

652
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:06,250
to continuously moving particles in some container

653
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:10,000
that will be maybe a bit more obviously physical,

654
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,920
a bit more familiar.

655
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,920
Are there any questions about the canonical

656
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,070
ensemble background or the physics of information

657
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:20,900
that you looked at today?

658
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:33,490
The site was shut down recording. See you tomorrow

659
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:39,340
morning, also heading to my office hours right now.

660
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,100
Questions come to mind.
