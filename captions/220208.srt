1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,600
OK, that recording should be under way. And

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:13,200
today's number is... not that one left from yesterday,

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,020
but eight four five, three one five.

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,190
All right,

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,790
let's pick up more or less where we

6
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,300
left off just at the end of yesterday. So welcome

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,950
back. Are there any questions about anything going

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,550
on so far in the course, what we saw yesterday or

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,190
the project or remainder of the material.

10
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,890
So office hours are Mondays and Fridays,

11
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,170
Mondays at five, right after the lecture we had

12
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,580
yesterday and Fridays at 10:00 right after that

13
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,110
Friday morning lecture, and I will head down to my

14
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,480
office, which is in the theoretical physics wing,

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,320
and also try to stay connected to the room, call

16
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,550
for anyone who isn't able to be here in person for.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,080
But

18
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,700
I of that. Right where we left off yesterday,

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,440
we'll wrap up random walks today and see in more

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,880
detail how they generalize. So yesterday to get a

21
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,400
first look at this random process that can be used

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,340
to model all sorts of things, we've. Cut it down

23
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,580
to the simplest possible random water, there was

24
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,750
just a walker who can go in one direction or the

25
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,960
other along the line, so single dimensional,

26
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,740
random walk probability of going in one direction

27
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,740
at every step, probability to which is one minus,

28
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,720
be going in the opposite direction. And after some,

29
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,610
the calculations found simple expressions for what

30
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,290
we're interested in, the final position of the

31
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:13,040
walk and the scale of fluctuations around, or the

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,940
variance in that position that depend just on P. Q

33
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,250
and the total number of steps which we can

34
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,930
rearrange in terms of a drift velocity and the

35
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:31,980
diffusion constants that describe how the

36
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,710
probability distribution for this walk or for any

37
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:43,710
walk in general, both drifts as time goes on and

38
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,340
also the same time spreads out or diffuses. So

39
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,120
while there is a.

40
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,370
A well defined expectation value that can we can

41
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,580
look at, it's drifted out as long as the water

42
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,440
gets longer, longer, with more and more steps

43
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,950
being added up in the sky in the process. At the

44
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,870
same time, the probability of finding exactly that

45
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,930
expectation value is dropping. And the.

46
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,510
The scale of fluctuations around that expectation

47
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,720
value is growing with and should have put up here,

48
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,200
this is a reminder, the characteristic dependence

49
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,590
on that square root of described by what's called

50
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:41,120
a law of diffusion. So from these two quantities,

51
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,200
the diffusion, constant and velocity, it is an

52
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,200
interesting question to see. How the scale of

53
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,770
fluctuations are behaving compared to that

54
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,730
expectation value when given the option of

55
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,580
dependence. We've just reviewed and saw yesterday,

56
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:05,380
we can almost write that down off the top of our

57
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,260
head. But to put in the full calculation for this.

58
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,570
Random walk with a fixed step at each point in

59
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,140
time. You saw the those fluctuations in the

60
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,780
numerator. In this ratio, so relative uncertainty.

61
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,240
Looking at the scale of fluctuations divided by

62
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,810
renormalize, by the drifting expectation value in

63
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,550
the case where he is not equal to has that

64
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,110
expectation, Diamond is not motivated by zero,

65
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:43,460
expectation in itself was proportional to end and

66
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,740
the two P minus one. So if we plug those in. We

67
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,270
have. To.

68
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,450
Q.

69
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,690
Can pull out.

70
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,920
Won over in times. The remainder of stuff that

71
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,670
depends on the details of the walk, we would

72
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,030
define the probabilities of stepping in either of

73
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,480
the allowable directions and related the number of

74
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,530
steps to the total length of time that the walk

75
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,950
takes. And up with that. Velocity for each

76
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,470
timestep of the total time, 90 times that same.

77
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,450
Somewhat messy factor, which is disproportional to

78
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,980
one over square root tea. So this ratio of scale

79
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,220
of relative fluctuations ends up going to zero

80
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,790
with one over security as the water gets longer

81
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,400
and longer. Approach that large and limits. There

82
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,310
are many steps all being added together in the

83
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,860
same sort of way that we saw for the central limit

84
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,130
theorem, which is.

85
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,460
Not necessarily what we might have guessed just by

86
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,600
looking at in particular this plot on the left

87
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,620
with the Lodrick velocity. It does not look like

88
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,450
the fluctuations are vanishing relative to the

89
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,870
expectation values. The highest point in that

90
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:28,510
curve and the of the only reason that's looking at

91
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,400
this part rather than doing the actual

92
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,250
mathematical calculation, what a excuse us is just

93
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,110
a trick of the eye. And considering times that are

94
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,250
not sufficiently long to suppress the particular

95
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,240
combination of P's and Q's that are showing up in

96
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,990
this case.

97
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,880
So

98
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:58,240
the conclusion of this is that even though the

99
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,730
probability distribution is spreading out around

100
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,420
that expectation, at most times, that drift is

101
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:10,420
always going to win, which is. I mentioned the

102
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,090
start of this exercise we could have. Forecast by

103
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,530
remembering the law of diffusion that is on the

104
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,930
scale of fluctuations, grows proportional to the

105
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,690
square root of tea, while the expectation values

106
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,520
proportional. See, so the ratio is just that one

107
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,280
over square root of tea and dependent on the

108
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,220
details of the steps and probabilities that we

109
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,010
impose for the particular grand walk. And this is

110
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,790
useful to know because it is very general, which

111
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,730
we can see by applying the central limit theorem,

112
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,780
which we saw last week, was where we stated, I

113
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,500
should say, last week was a very general limit

114
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,520
theorem applicable to all random processes where

115
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,500
the mean and variance for each of the single

116
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,960
experiments that's being repeated many times,

117
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,220
those mean and variances are finite. We train the

118
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,210
variable. So.

119
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,140
The connection to the central limit theorem to

120
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,560
consider. Is the way I think I mentioned yesterday,

121
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,950
each step in that random walk becomes that random

122
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,620
variable. It's independent, it's identically

123
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,750
distributed, and once we add up all of the steps,

124
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,060
we're still fixing that length to be one. The sum

125
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,480
of all the steps and the random walk is exactly

126
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,100
the same quantity s for which we.

127
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,560
In terms of which.

128
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,250
We introduced the form of the central limit

129
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:11,230
theorem that is relevant to. She you to work, and

130
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,990
we saw there that the overall probability

131
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,610
distribution for the length of that random walk or

132
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,500
that some of the steps depends only on the

133
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,100
characteristics of that underlying single step

134
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,660
process. Those characteristics being the mean and

135
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,990
variance where you saved the letters new and sigma

136
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,520
for the single step. It is a single step we can

137
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,480
very easily compute what the mean and variances.

138
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:53,330
And you may have already done so in your head.

139
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,880
Does anyone have an idea for how to go about

140
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,140
computing? I mean, just of that process of taking

141
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,620
a step farther to the left minus one was probably

142
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,100
a cue or to the rights one plus one the

143
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,960
probability.

144
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:23,260
This is before. It's the usual definition sum over

145
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,440
all the possibilities and the outcome sets that

146
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,030
walk length of times the corresponding probability.

147
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,340
So the walk length with C plus one to go to the

148
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,950
right probability, T minus one to go to the left

149
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:43,320
with probability. Q And that is putting it to

150
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,090
being one minus P, you get to P minus one, which

151
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,880
just so happens to be the expectation value for

152
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,210
the total supply divided by the number of steps.

153
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,960
So the fundamental definition is behaving as you

154
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,680
would expect and similarly for the expectation

155
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,760
value of XY squared. The only difference here is

156
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,620
that minus one squared goes to four equals one. So

157
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,610
instead of minus two, we get plus Q. And those two

158
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,240
possibilities always add up to 100 percent

159
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,880
Firewalker stepping only to the left or to the

160
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,060
right. So then it's just the process of plugging

161
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,680
those in to the variance. The expectation value of

162
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,550
the square is one and then the square of the

163
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:37,200
expectation value is square that for P squared,

164
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,990
minus four. Plus one.

165
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,660
Which is just for three times when minus P

166
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,150
distributing that negative sign.

167
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,280
Which again, when I was P is for P, Q, which is.

168
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,060
Scale of fluctuations in the total SNEPP length,

169
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,430
also divided by N. So from the form of a central

170
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,870
bureau that was written down. A few pages earlier,

171
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,850
the notes and is essentially reproduced here. We

172
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:25,120
have to do is plug in this for Q, where Sigma

173
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,420
Squared appears in the probability distribution

174
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,810
for the summer, we call called X for the total

175
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:38,410
lauchlan. And similarly to minus one. That's where

176
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,130
the need for that single step process occurs, and

177
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,450
then it's easy enough to rewrite that in terms of

178
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,380
the.

179
00:12:52,490 --> 00:13:01,340
The diffusion constant, the. B squared was four P

180
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,340
Q we computed earlier and that drift velocity.

181
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:13,750
Which was. Just. Make sure I don't drop any

182
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,420
factors.

183
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,600
I did drop by a factor of. The Delta teams that

184
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,530
are canceling out. With this and we're actually

185
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,690
delighted to be here, I'm tending to one that is.

186
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,680
This is in this particular form. So then the drift

187
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:46,060
velocity itself is exactly that. In T minus one.

188
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:53,470
So we have the probability distribution for the

189
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,960
final position of the war just as a normal

190
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,510
distribution, which is precisely what we're

191
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:08,700
looking at in the possibly we. Discussed yesterday.

192
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,910
And what this means is a general.

193
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:23,920
Outcome to take away is that whenever the. Central

194
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,270
is applicable, so whatever that means in terms of

195
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,440
the single step process are finite, we can

196
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:39,650
identify. Drift velocity as related to the meat of

197
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,290
that single step process and the diffusion

198
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,740
constant. He's connected to the variance of that

199
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,370
single step process, and upon adding up all of

200
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,450
these individual random processes, we end up with

201
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,380
a smooth, normal distribution for the position of

202
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,460
the water. At the end of its log is a function of

203
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:07,740
the time that the law takes. So that establishes

204
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,920
precisely how general matlab diffusion is. It will

205
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,560
apply. So the. Scale the fluctuations increasing

206
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,840
proportional to the square t the probability of

207
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,650
diffusing away from the expectation that it's

208
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,680
going to be the case whenever that central limit

209
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,780
theorem is applicable.

210
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,990
And if we. Look at the final form of the

211
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,790
probability distribution. Expressed here, you can

212
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,510
sort of read off the kind of behavior we were

213
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,310
seeing, the response that as.

214
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,410
We look further and further away from the peak of

215
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,120
this probability distribution, which is the place

216
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,660
where the negative factor in this exponential is

217
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,300
the smallest, right, where the numerator is equal

218
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,990
to zero as we get further away from that. In order

219
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:13,640
to. Achieve the same probability of oral arguments

220
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,220
to reach a given value, this. Denominator dividing

221
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,650
through factor X minus velocity quantity squared

222
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,760
also has to become larger. In other words, at. The

223
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,570
peak is becoming broader and then the overall

224
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,080
multiplicative factor is just there in order to

225
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,770
keep the overall probability integrated of all

226
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:47,440
possible values equal to one hundred percent. As

227
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,820
required by its definition.

228
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,050
Now, we'll just wrap up by saying that. It is

229
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,020
possible for the central in the film and the law

230
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,080
of diffusion to break down, and that will be part

231
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,170
two of the computer project where the first part

232
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,870
you're going to look at a slightly more

233
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,570
interesting random walk where the step lengths are

234
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,700
not fixed to across the valley, but are drawn

235
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,960
randomly from a probability distribution obtained

236
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,480
by the transform sampling. And then in the second

237
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,690
part of the project. So the first part, we draw

238
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,380
those variable step sizes from a well-behaved

239
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,070
probability distribution with a finite mean and

240
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:40,080
variance. The second part, we look at a more

241
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,350
complicated distribution where. The central limit

242
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,040
theorem and more diffusion will break down. So

243
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,580
that is it's getting everything in place for work

244
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,190
on that computer project. Now, there any.

245
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,210
Questions about.

246
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,880
Any of the stuff we've seen so far wrapping up

247
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,830
with these random box?

248
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,520
Because at this point, we're going to

249
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:17,690
move to the second unit and in particular dive

250
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:25,250
into the sort of core focus of this module as a

251
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,850
whole, which is the concept of statistical

252
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:32,130
ensembles, building of this community foundation

253
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:37,640
we've so far in terms of. Collections of large

254
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,620
numbers of repeated experiments

255
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,770
drawn from some distribution with an element of

256
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,040
randomness that collectively give rise to a

257
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,480
well-defined, smooth behavior governed by its

258
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,480
central limit, involve large numbers when there

259
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,030
are insufficient number of degrees of freedom. In

260
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:06,800
the system, so we're going to start off with

261
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,370
another round of definitions and showing where

262
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,170
this more physical concept of statistical

263
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,010
ensembles and thermodynamics in particular from

264
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:23,270
the real connects to the probability spaces and

265
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,060
random processes seem so far.

266
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:34,420
So. The basic perspective is. Connecting to the

267
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,110
definitions we started off with last week, the

268
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,840
experiments that we're going to consider in the

269
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,630
context of thermodynamics are simply taking some

270
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:47,440
collection of degrees of freedom of particles in

271
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,980
general for short and just look at the arrangement

272
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,670
of those particles as they evolved in time subject

273
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:00,310
to certain constraints. So we the state system or

274
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:03,280
equivalently the measurement that we are

275
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,190
interested in performing on that stage at a given

276
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:11,260
time. It's just defined by the arrangement of

277
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,470
these many underlying degrees of freedom. So a

278
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,840
concrete example.

279
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:24,040
Which is one we will. Look at a few times in a few

280
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,310
different perspectives. This system is. To suppose

281
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,280
there are degrees of freedom are what are called

282
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,120
spin's essentially arrows that can point either up

283
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,950
or down. So this likely the simple right of what

284
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,570
you were just looking at. There were only two

285
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,910
possibilities. This has some of the same

286
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,020
mathematical features. As simple coin for the

287
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,100
experiment, the final breakdown they represented

288
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,410
the state for as it spins here. To just have some

289
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,050
pointing out, some pointing down, if I were to

290
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,320
label those heads or tails, it would be the same

291
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,290
sort of state that we would get from flipping a

292
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,820
coin here or call it the configuration of these

293
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,150
spins and the. Total number of possible

294
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,110
configurations is just the total number of ways

295
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,690
this and spins.

296
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,480
Can each independently be pointing either up or

297
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,840
down? So two possibilities for each and spins,

298
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:37,450
which in this case of equals eight us that

299
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,810
backwards because it is two possibilities for.

300
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,530
Each of the US spends.

301
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,070
Starting to get that backwards in the case of any

302
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,950
of those eight. Two of the eight is two hundred

303
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,740
and fifty six possibilities.

304
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,310
If we then. Let the system evolve in time and look

305
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,430
at it again at some different time, too, as

306
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:19,740
opposed to T one, we will get a new state or two

307
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,750
that is in general different from a legal one, but.

308
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:29,850
From either empirical observation of physical

309
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:35,820
systems or Gerda's theorem, we know that there are

310
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,930
certain measurements on the state that would

311
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:43,950
always produce the same outcome, even as the state

312
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,640
changes over time. And that was an outcome that is

313
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,610
always the same for different states, is what we

314
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,780
know as the conserved quantity. The obvious

315
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,330
example we're hopefully familiar will be

316
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,550
conservation of energy inside a closed or isolated

317
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:07,230
system that is not in contact with any other

318
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,280
system. It can be considered just if they hold the.

319
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,050
When it is considered as a whole, it's total

320
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,290
energy has to be conserved, so the same as a

321
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:25,140
measurement on. And the possible states that can

322
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,590
be produced by the time evolution of our

323
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,030
collection of degrees of freedom.

324
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,720
Probably familiar, and you may know that it can be

325
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:42,610
rigorously proven through his first theorem.

326
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,750
Something that you won't go through here, you

327
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,000
might see in a field through the group theory

328
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:57,260
module. But because. Statistical physics was first

329
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,120
developed before his theory, this conservation of

330
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,690
energy was merely an empirical observation that

331
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:11,850
was. Taken to be a fundamental law of the universe

332
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:18,720
known as the first law of thermodynamics. So this

333
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,240
first law sounds impressive. It really is just

334
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,520
energy conservation or equivalently, the statement

335
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,870
that if an energy of some system, which we can

336
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,740
call a capital, will make changes, then this

337
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,280
change in energy must be compensated or accounted

338
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,310
for by an equal and opposite change in the energy

339
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,510
of some other system with which America is in

340
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:47,550
contact, which we will see in the context of where

341
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,820
we will apply that to handle heat engines,

342
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,270
refrigerators and other similar cycles in the

343
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,780
framework of the economical ensemble. But before

344
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,630
we get to canonical ensemble, we have to define

345
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:10,340
what an ensemble is in and of itself. And that. In

346
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,120
order to do so, we can start thinking about

347
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,590
conservation of energy a bit more concretely and

348
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,580
getting back to that speed system that follows the

349
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,760
same mathematics and sticking points, we can bring

350
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,850
in energy by supposing that these things are each

351
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,030
representing the magnetic dipole moments of some

352
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:39,020
molecule that can interact with a constant

353
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,790
external magnetic field, the strength we will call

354
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,230
H where the strength of the magnetic field.

355
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,700
Really just has to do with the energy that it

356
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,850
contributes to interacting with any one of these

357
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,750
spins. So we have a.

358
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:05,790
Magnetic field oriented upward with that strength

359
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,930
age, and I'm assume that this is this field is

360
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:15,270
pervading this whole box that I'm drawing, and if

361
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,820
I have this upward pointing spin that is parallel

362
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,140
to that field.

363
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,630
We're going to say that this contributes energy

364
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,130
age to the.

365
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:34,590
This is negative if you want. So there is a

366
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,450
negative energy.

367
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:44,090
Coming in from having a spin, a line with the

368
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:49,190
magnetic field, if there is similarly the spin and

369
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
she aligned, pointing opposite to that magnetic

370
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,340
field, the energy that it contributes as well is.

371
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,970
Depositary.

372
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:10,780
We have then some number of spins pointing upward

373
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:16,780
and the remainder point downward, total energy of

374
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:23,320
that system. Is negative eight times the number

375
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:29,030
pointing upward. What's the positive age from the

376
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:34,580
remainder? And spins minus those and plus upward

377
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,820
pointing spins, which we can rearrange into.

378
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,440
That same.

379
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,520
But a minus eight, minus three to plus minus and.

380
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,970
Somewhat similar to the length of the random walk

381
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,010
that we were looking at previously, just because

382
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:08,720
we've defined simple systems that have the same

383
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,340
mathematical features as these new coin flip. So.

384
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:20,320
If I looked up the. State that I came up with on

385
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,910
the previous page, and just as a reminder, six

386
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,640
upward point expense and two pointing down.

387
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,370
The energy of that.

388
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,320
Representing the state would be this minus age

389
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,110
factor with two times six is 12, minus the total

390
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,250
number of students is eight. So that is minus four,

391
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,750
which is less than zero.

392
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,800
And that the negative sign of the total energy is

393
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,620
just a reflection of the majority of those

394
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,040
standards being pointed upward, aligned with this

395
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,200
metallic field that's bringing in that negative

396
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,680
energy.

397
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,290
So.

398
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:13,960
The interesting. Or an important consequence of

399
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,310
defining this energy is that since it is conserved,

400
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,280
there's now only a fraction of those two to the

401
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,400
eighth or two hundred fifty six states that are

402
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,300
accessible.

403
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,160
So.

404
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,340
If we look at the total number of states with

405
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,490
serious energy, not zero, but.

406
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,470
Minus four H.

407
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,640
How many of those two hundred fifty six states

408
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:02,860
would have this energy that we are going to see or

409
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,660
demand is conserved from connection to legacy or

410
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,290
everyday experience, empirical observation?

411
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,210
Can anyone tell the other what computation I would

412
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:24,770
need to do or just the answer to the total number

413
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,830
of those two hundred and fifty six states with

414
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,520
this energy?

415
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:50,140
So that is binomial coefficients. Eight to six,

416
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,320
which is a factorial over six factorial.

417
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,000
Times two. So the six Vectorial cancels out

418
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,000
everything below seven. So it's eight times seven.

419
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Over to four times seven is twenty eight. So the

420
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,230
fraction. Of allowable states with a conserve

421
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:16,700
energy. Is that twenty eight over two, fifty six,

422
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:22,670
two, five, four and seven sixty four. So it's only

423
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,430
about 10 percent of the states that would be

424
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,830
accessible. To assess that once we impose

425
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,860
conservation of energy. And once we recognize that

426
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,870
energy is conserved.

427
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:47,570
We can also. Looking beyond the simple collection

428
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:51,470
of two state spins can talk about the energy use

429
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,930
for molecules in the container, which. It's

430
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,810
another standard example from dynamics that would

431
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,660
come back to you from several perspectives

432
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:07,040
repeatedly in this module where you can write a

433
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,930
simple expression. For the energy of these these

434
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,550
molecules by. Assuming that they are small enough,

435
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:19,240
we can approximate them as a point particle where

436
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,060
we ignore any size that they have or any structure,

437
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,630
the spin or angular momentum that they may have.

438
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,600
So that reduces the energy to just a computation

439
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,690
of kinetic energy. The velocity squared for each

440
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,870
of these molecules times, the mass that we assume

441
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:45,490
is the same for each molecule and we can rearrange

442
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:51,320
in terms of momentum. He's the mass times velocity

443
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,990
and the energy that is the sum of all of his party

444
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,430
calls for the momentum squared, which is a free

445
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:05,720
vector in a container in three dimensions divided

446
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,140
by this overall factor of one over two times the

447
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:14,400
mass. So whether we're thinking of spins in the

448
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,140
field or a bunch of molecules bouncing around a

449
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:22,900
container, we have the perspective that the time

450
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:27,500
evolution of any of these systems is is the Kaspi

451
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,200
process. And was the system probabilistically

452
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,410
adopts the sequence of states? Drawn from the

453
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:40,770
total outcome space of all of the configurations

454
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,820
of spenger molecules or in general particles. That

455
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,500
out of which it is composed, so rather than trying

456
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:56,980
to apply Newton's laws to follow the motion of all

457
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,550
of these ten of the twenty three molecules, which

458
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,640
would require writing down the power, twenty three

459
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,430
initial conditions and solving ten hour twenty

460
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:09,940
three differential equations, which is not

461
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:16,270
practical with any technology. We just. Say that

462
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,470
with each tick of some clock, the system with 10

463
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:24,310
to 20 free particles is adopting one state after

464
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,250
another after another, which is.

465
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:33,920
Exactly the set up that we went through and the

466
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,550
Probability Foundation's over the previous week.

467
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,300
And then you sort of form a connection between

468
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:47,190
this statistical view of physical systems and

469
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,360
those early foundations is this definition of

470
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:56,610
statistical ensemble that was introduced by a

471
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:01,080
physicist named Gibs in the early nineteen

472
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,740
hundreds. So that one hundred twenty years ago now

473
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:09,760
where the statistical ensemble is that same set of

474
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,540
all states that we defined in terms of

475
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,350
probabilities.

476
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,040
That's so the several states that the system could

477
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,600
possibly adopt through its time evolution and each

478
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,710
of these states has a corresponding probability of

479
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,640
being adopted by the system, are only going to

480
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:33,070
consider non-zero probabilities. So we say if the

481
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,890
state has no probability of being adopted, it's

482
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:39,310
not a possible state at all in the first place.

483
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,370
And we can recognize this connection of states

484
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:49,000
with probabilities as the probability space that

485
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,670
we were working with in that first year that.

486
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,810
And just as another piece of terminology, because

487
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:04,990
each of these states that. Our system of interest

488
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:09,760
can possibly take you specified by its microscopic

489
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,280
degrees of freedom, the particles that are

490
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,230
bouncing around and producing the large scale

491
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:18,640
behavior going to call them microstates, which

492
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,360
will eventually be contrasted with macro stage

493
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,690
with the states or quantum states, because there

494
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,540
are lots of different types of states with

495
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:32,500
connections between them that will come along in

496
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,460
the next few weeks.

497
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:41,980
So. The. Requirement for probability space that

498
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,740
the. Some over all the possibilities of all of the

499
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:51,930
states add up to one is now just the statement

500
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:56,880
that the system must be in some microstates at any

501
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,090
point in time, and the probabilistic sampling of

502
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:06,010
those microstates. It is going to define the

503
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,970
market, determine the behavior of the system that

504
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:15,850
emerges and is observed over those long timescales

505
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,970
with many steps and many states being sample.

506
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,730
Now, bringing in the fact that there are these

507
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:31,200
conserved quantities like the energy. You saw that

508
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,460
imposing that conservation restricts the number of

509
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,060
states that have a non-zero probability of being

510
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:43,680
adopted, which means that the statistical ensemble

511
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,080
defined as the sets of states with the

512
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,760
corresponding probabilities. Depends, which is

513
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,900
characterized by the particular quantities that

514
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,180
are conserved and the first example that we will

515
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:02,030
look at through this whole unit is what it's

516
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,590
called for obscure historical reasons, the micro

517
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,470
canonical ensemble. So it's a fancy name for a

518
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,200
simple idea. All it is, is that statistical

519
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,040
ensemble, a set of states that a system can adopt

520
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,600
where the energy is conserved and the number of

521
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,720
degrees of freedom. Is conserved, which because

522
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,700
degrees of freedom has a lot of syllables, what is

523
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,280
call that particle? So it might be economical

524
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,200
ensemble is the first example of a statistical

525
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,080
ensemble that will see really conserved quantities.

526
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,640
Characterizing it are the internal energy and the

527
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,540
particle. No.

528
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:53,370
And. The. The fact that. The energy in particular

529
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:59,370
is conservative, means that any system delivered

530
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,370
by the microbiological ensemble has to be isolated

531
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:05,610
in the sense that it's not in contact with any

532
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,740
other system with which you could exchange energy

533
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,790
or particles. So the thought of handwaving view of

534
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:15,180
a micro canonical system that we could have is a

535
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:20,250
bunch of particles in a box that is floating in a

536
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,760
perfect void in space and unable to exchange any

537
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,630
energy or particles or information with anything

538
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,750
else than we and the rest of the universe. So

539
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:34,950
impermeable walls around this collection of

540
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,620
particles through which none of the particles

541
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:41,100
themselves or the energy or radiation can travel.

542
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:59,570
If we think of this picture of particles in a

543
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:04,490
sealed container, we can make the approximation

544
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:08,060
that if this room were to be sealed off from the

545
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,480
outside world, so no one was coming in and out. No,

546
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,460
no noise, no able to leak in or out. That should

547
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:20,770
be. Described by a microeconomic ensemble, and we

548
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:25,560
do have some intuition about roughly how that

549
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,920
system should behave, and in particular our

550
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,680
intuition is that the. Behaviour of the states

551
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,010
that the system adopts over time tends to be

552
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,420
smooth and fairly uniform. So the usual suspects.

553
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,410
The particles of this box to be roughly evenly

554
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:53,330
spread as I. Sketched out just by unthinking

555
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:56,690
assumption here, rather than being all

556
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,580
concentrated in one corner of the room, and

557
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,680
similarly, if we did find, say, this room in a

558
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,470
state where all the air was concentrated in the

559
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,320
lower back right corner, you would expect that

560
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,460
states not to be typical, but all the area to

561
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,880
expand into the rest of the room, filling that

562
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,970
vacuum and producing something like what we feel.

563
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:24,540
Were the molecules forming the air? Have no

564
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,360
visible railings, no gusts of wind going through,

565
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,000
no big shifts in time.

566
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,610
So that intuition is. What we can have in mind

567
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:41,060
with this concept of thermodynamic equilibrium

568
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:47,150
where. It's really an axiom or hypothesis known as

569
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,750
the regarding hypothesis, that these physical

570
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:55,180
systems generically evolve towards the dynamic

571
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,380
equilibrium, the sort of stable state that

572
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,890
persists over time on human timescales.

573
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:03,880
Which we can.

574
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,650
Translater, move from the handwaving intuition.

575
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,940
I've been walking through towards a statement

576
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,300
about mathematics and probabilities by

577
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,360
mathematically defining what thermodynamic

578
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,930
equilibrium means, at least to the microeconomic

579
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:27,920
ensemble through these probabilities that we have.

580
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,540
Introduced for each states that are thermodynamic

581
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:38,110
system could possibly adopt. So with the

582
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,140
definitions that we have for micro economical

583
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,720
system, we'll make up the total number of

584
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,310
microstates in America called Capital M.

585
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,190
So the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium. If

586
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:58,480
and only if all of those probabilities are equal.

587
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:03,100
So that means any individual state has an equal

588
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,730
probability of being realised by the system

589
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:10,560
through its time evolution. And in particular,

590
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,770
because these movies have to add up to one and we

591
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:16,560
know there are some of them that are all equal, we

592
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,810
can immediately write down what the probabilities

593
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:23,160
are. They just one over so that the sum adds up to

594
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:30,930
one hundred percent. So. This. Conex, I guess it's

595
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,180
it may not be obvious how this mathematical

596
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:38,580
definition connects to the intuition I was going

597
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:43,240
through earlier in terms of what we expect for the

598
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,440
position of all the air molecules in this room.

599
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:51,730
And much of the remainder of this unit and indeed

600
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:55,540
the ability to connect the mathematics to everyday

601
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:59,050
experience, what does this mean? But before diving

602
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:03,820
into that, one thing to keep in mind. Is that

603
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,370
equilibrium, the steady state is again an example

604
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:12,640
of state being used in two different ways. The

605
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,020
overall large scale states of our system is steady

606
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,410
in the sense that it is in the delivery of it is

607
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:26,630
not showing any large scale changes, but. The

608
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,240
microstates being sampled by the system are

609
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,450
constantly changing from one moment of time to the

610
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:32,950
next.

611
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:37,980
So rather than being in a single micro state, be

612
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,610
this equilibrium system, which is the terminology

613
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:44,860
I should use instead of the states, it probably

614
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,730
simply adopts all of the possible micro states

615
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:51,510
with equal probability through its time evolution.

616
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:59,100
So. That initial section was largely a matter of

617
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:03,030
introducing definitions for statistical ensemble,

618
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:07,320
like a canonical ensemble and equilibrium. Are

619
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,680
there any questions about that before we wrap it

620
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,400
up for today?

621
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,620
Just in the last few minutes, I'll take a little

622
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:35,120
take a brief look at the next topic that will be

623
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,210
our focus on Friday, which brings in one of the

624
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,190
famous derived qualities that I'm sure you've

625
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,760
heard of is not necessarily mathematically defined

626
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,080
in this way before, which is entropy. And the

627
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,240
second of all, the dynamics that do that, the

628
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,660
entropy of a closed system is always increasing

629
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:00,500
and as time goes on. So we will drive that

630
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:04,030
probably on Friday and if not shortly thereafter.

631
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:08,260
But. What we will do

632
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,270
this is a preview, is a definition of entropy

633
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:20,630
based on the probabilities. That show up in our

634
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,770
microeconomic ensemble or indeed any sophistical

635
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:29,380
ensemble. And you will want to use. It's quite a

636
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,770
bit of entropy to characterize some of the

637
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:37,300
equilibrium in a way that more closely connects

638
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:41,890
via the mathematics that we are working with these

639
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,050
probabilistic sample states compared to that every

640
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:51,750
day intuition. And just as well.

641
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:56,650
The initial connection is our expectation that

642
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:02,070
quantity is. Derived from the behavior of the

643
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,820
microstates of our system are going to be stable

644
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,600
over time, even as various different microstates

645
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,610
are probabilistically adopted.

646
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:14,460
And.

647
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,520
The argument here is that we know in the macro

648
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,830
economic cycle these two quantities that are

649
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:24,410
absolutely stable over time, those are the

650
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:27,110
conservative qualities that characterize any

651
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,540
system governed by the right, kind of like on

652
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:33,050
ensemble, namely the energy and particle number,

653
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:37,310
which we should then expect to be able to express

654
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:40,340
entropy as a function of those two conserved

655
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:49,630
qualities. So that is. Yes, the. Forecast for what

656
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:55,390
we will. Do what we would go through next time. So

657
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,530
with that, I'll give one last call for questions

658
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:04,330
about probability or statistical ensembles. And if

659
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:07,270
there aren't any ill start wrapping up the

660
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,630
recruiting, shutting things down and see you again

661
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,520
this time in a few days.

662
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:29,660
It.
