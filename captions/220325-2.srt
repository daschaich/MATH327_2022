1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,270
OK, the bells have rung, so it's time for me to get

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,680
under way, even though I'm still getting

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,730
everything in order today.  We can start with the

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,770
usual six digit code for this afternoon:

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,500
Four nine, three eight, nine

6
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,480
seven.

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,780
See if there are any questions about

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,190
the quantum gases we've been going through this week,

9
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,550
or anything else in the course so far, or even coming up.

10
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:03,900
There was a bit of discussion on the Canvas site forums

11
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,260
about historical developments of some of the

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,660
concepts we've been dealing with, in particular

13
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,010
entropy, and there'll be a bit more historical

14
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,820
commentary in the exercise I have planned for today,

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,330
but I'm going to somewhat violate the principle I

16
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,030
proposed online and give a lot of credit to a

17
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,800
particular individual for introducing a new idea.

18
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,600
But I won't give to that right away.

19
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,530
Instead of.

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,850
It's very briefly in the couple of minutes to

21
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,080
elaborate on some topics that came up during the

22
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,060
lectures, which might benefit from a bit more

23
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,480
background information, at least for those who

24
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:03,070
aren't already familiar with the. And the first

25
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,680
actually was when I was pulling up in my window

26
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,900
when it started.

27
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,520
Which has to do with the. Details of photons that

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,360
we discussed earlier this week, I'm not sure why

29
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,400
that the search, but.

30
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,840
I've collected a few visualizations of.

31
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,750
We used to picture those photons and in particular,

32
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,130
their connection to electric and magnetic waves or

33
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,450
electromagnetic waves, which may well be familiar

34
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,040
to some of you from previous modules, but could be

35
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,900
useful if you don't have a picture to guide

36
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,100
intuition as to why photons are waves like they

37
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,960
have a wave, like the frequency and how they're

38
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:15,190
connected to the. Electric magnetic fields and a

39
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,560
particular electromagnetic radiation that's just

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,760
trying to zoom in on one of these illustrations at

41
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,520
a time, because all the flashing at once may not

42
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,860
be easiest to understand the not going into any

43
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,380
technical details about this. This is more picture

44
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,030
to date intuition that we have electric fields

45
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,000
here showing is red and magnetic fields shown is

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,470
blue that oscillates in relation with each other

47
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,320
here. They don't have any phase shifts, so they

48
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,670
have maximum minima at the same point. And as they

49
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,240
oscillate.

50
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,640
That corresponds to a propagation of energy, the

51
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:09,430
form of photons you're going along this area off

52
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:15,290
to the right of the screen. Where the distance

53
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,640
between subsequent Mexico in each of these

54
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,780
oscillations defines the wavelength of. This wave,

55
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,060
which we interpret as the wave length of the

56
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,030
photon and the number of. That signals that.

57
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,940
The radiation dose through each second then

58
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,000
combines with the wave length to determine the

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,820
speed with which this radiation is propagating,

60
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,760
which Maxwell famously found to be the speed of

61
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,410
light to be able to identify light as precisely

62
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,210
these fluctuations in electromagnetic radiation.

63
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,770
The main points of figures that are collected on

64
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,880
this page, all the from the camp site later today

65
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,990
is the two polarizations states that were

66
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,520
mentioned in the lecture. For this, we have what

67
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,950
you get is certainly electric fields are

68
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,570
oscillating the vertical direction perpendicular

69
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,260
to the fields in the horizontal direction is

70
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,920
what's known as a linear polarization of light.

71
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,110
And there's a second one where. This picture is

72
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,670
just tilted 90 degrees outside so that the fields

73
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,020
are possibly in total direction, the way we had

74
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,440
field is inflated vertically.

75
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,820
What is another way of. Representing these two

76
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,480
photon polarizations is actually two.

77
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:07,490
On. Essentially. Interpolate between them as time

78
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,840
goes on each of these cycles. So that you did

79
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,440
point in the cycle. I could feel the same be

80
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,920
oriented on the portable axis this year and the

81
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,770
extreme volatility cycle, it gets around to the

82
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,010
vertical axis. So there's a picture of the

83
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,910
polarizations of tracing out the circle. That goes

84
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:41,180
along with the frequency of this wave, rather than

85
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,820
drawing that with my fingers, I can just.

86
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,450
The other two. Illustrations on this page, which

87
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:57,000
are linked to further discussions and.

88
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,560
During that interpolation of the electric

89
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,560
orientation, Qasm decided to desired.

90
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,220
Leads to what's called circular polarization,

91
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,510
which can precede that either in two ways,

92
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:20,520
depending on what you trace around. In a clockwise

93
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,010
or counterclockwise direction, as the cycles pass

94
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,440
passed, they still have wavelength separating the

95
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,130
peaks and electric fields and the clear

96
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,540
propagation in this case still always to the right

97
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:43,330
side of the screen. And here's a. Sort of like a

98
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:48,170
where treaty out the direction that the electorate

99
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,890
is changing with the figures and then the sun is

100
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,800
pointing in the direction of propagation for the

101
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:00,630
whole rest of time. Similarly, the other faiths

102
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,340
that we treat is the ultimate direction of

103
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,360
propagation and that the left hand pointed in the

104
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,200
direction of propagation I of propagation rather

105
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,950
than rotation. The two circular polarization sets

106
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,740
of photons is evolving linear combinations of the

107
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:26,950
linear polarization states. Provided those two

108
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:34,300
extra generous energy levels for. Any given energy

109
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,960
level that we any given energy, any combination of

110
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,530
momentum that we have for photons or will be for

111
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,670
any other mass, this particle covered by its

112
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:51,140
wavelength or frequency. So hopefully that is

113
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,260
useful and not just. Making things more confusing

114
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:03,470
for those who haven't. Seen. These details of U.S.

115
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,070
preventive radiation and its interpretation is

116
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,550
photons before. Are there immediate questions on

117
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,020
that topic? Yeah, with the words that you said

118
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,610
there was the energy that was not.

119
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,870
So. With everything else the same, those two ways

120
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,880
of sort of things are going to degenerate into

121
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,980
battles that they've brought in as an overall

122
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,860
factor to our calculations. Earlier this week. So

123
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,600
it sounds like it's cleared up. Might not have

124
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,700
presented so clearly

125
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,160
what other further questions about so-called.

126
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,680
You seem to be thinking about. Ms. We can always

127
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,490
come back to this.

128
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,010
There was one other. For Tom DeLay, the topic that

129
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,920
I mentioned in passing, that is sort of fun to

130
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,550
take a look at a bit more deeply than exercise for

131
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,260
you to go through this. I'll try not to take up

132
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,230
too much of your time in the tutorial, but that

133
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,100
connects to the cosmic microwave background

134
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,360
radiation and the particular mentioned in passing

135
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,770
that these sorts of measurements of the

136
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,920
temperature of the cosmic microwave background.

137
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,000
Provide evidence for the existence of dark matter,

138
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,270
which is ongoing research, trying to figure out

139
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:52,550
the properties and the fundamental nature of dark

140
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:57,560
matter, interpreted as some new set of particles

141
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,240
that are as yet unknown in fundamental theories of

142
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,740
physics. And a

143
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,830
quick reminder, this cosmic background radiation

144
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:16,320
is left over from. About three hundred eighty

145
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,320
thousand years after the Big Bang, the universe

146
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,700
cooled enough for the plasma of electrons and

147
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,840
protons to combine into neutral atoms and wildlife

148
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,250
to propagate its propagating for thirteen point

149
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,010
eight billion years since then, before reaching us

150
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:41,480
to form this sort of pattern. And what we didn't

151
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:48,020
go over and lectures was. How these patterns of

152
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,290
those complaints and rules are sorry, those are

153
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,410
the hot emails of the contractures, different

154
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,670
Bibles, one part in 10000 around the average

155
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:04,130
temperature. Those depend on dark matter through

156
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,900
the dynamics of the Spurtle universe plasma, which

157
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,980
is affected by precisely what particles are in

158
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,410
that plasma and how they're all interacting with

159
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,820
each other, going through those calculations,

160
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,950
which is sort of the module itself, leaves a six

161
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,710
parameter expression for

162
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,390
things like the behavior of the cosmic microwave

163
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,840
background. Indeed, all other cosmological aspects

164
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,430
of the early universe. This is known as Lambdas

165
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,220
Kvamme model, where

166
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,640
Lambda refers to what's known as Dark Energy,

167
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,320
which will be mentioned briefly in the lecture on

168
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,860
Monday. And KVAMME stands for cold dark matter,

169
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,290
cold, meaning that this is a non relativistic gas

170
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,480
of not interacting particles.

171
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,220
And.

172
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,210
I have printed out here the usual way, which I

173
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,390
have to zoom out the usual way of.

174
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,310
Mathematically analyzed those patterns of

175
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,740
temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave

176
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,160
background, which I think I mentioned in class, is

177
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,080
to look at the correlations between those

178
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,070
different points, which here are plotted on two

179
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,150
equivalents, horizontal axis, one being a multiple

180
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,240
moments and the other being the corresponding

181
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,690
angular scale over which we are looking for

182
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:53,600
correlations. So to take a quick step back to this

183
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,010
figure, the idea is this is the projection of the

184
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,910
entire sky on two dimensions. So distances in here

185
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,940
correspond to angular separations looking in one

186
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,160
direction and then another separated by some angle.

187
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,090
You can spin to fix that angle. Look at all

188
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,820
possible orientations and all possible

189
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,540
translation's the night sky. And the product of

190
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,740
the energy is coming in at those two angles, some

191
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,090
integrated over orientation's translation's gives

192
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:33,720
this simple angular spectrum that corresponds to

193
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,510
the vertical axis plotted against the angular

194
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,930
scales. So maybe the simple limit is a 90 degree

195
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:46,120
separation. On this plot, which is a dipole. And

196
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,080
then looking at.

197
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:54,950
Points that are more and more closely aligned in

198
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,740
their angle. Corresponds to higher multiple

199
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,420
moments in in that expansion. It's probably easier

200
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,500
at first glance to interpret this in terms of that

201
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,560
scale, looking at points that are two degrees

202
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,460
apart, half a degree apart, or even smaller

203
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:22,470
angular scales where. The line on this graph,

204
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,330
which is coming from

205
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,620
a few years ago, that still this.

206
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,140
This was based on the release of the first three

207
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,530
years of data by the Wilkinson Microwave Software

208
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:48,180
Program, which was in 2006 and provided the first

209
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,590
resolution of the second peak in the spectrum

210
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,560
power spectrum here, getting below the half a

211
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,370
degree and separation. The functional form of the

212
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,890
line that is being fit to all these data from that

213
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,760
experiment and the earlier experiments that were

214
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,030
mostly based on the earth that are high up the

215
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,800
balance or carried balloons to try to avoid.

216
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,850
Interference from the Earth's atmosphere.

217
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,480
Is precisely given by the six parameter

218
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,840
expression's. Michael, respond to that dark energy

219
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,610
and dark matter model of cosmology, of which the

220
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:43,590
key feature is the second and third piece in the

221
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,560
singular power spectrum being roughly the same

222
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,070
height, about twenty five hundred in these units

223
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:54,400
of Microtel squared. And to give a.

224
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:01,120
Slight contrast illustrates how that matters. But

225
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,210
it has to do with dark energy. This figure from

226
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,660
just a few years later, which is using a lot of

227
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,110
the same data with some improvements around that

228
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,810
third peak, you're showing two different

229
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,700
predictions for this angular power spectrum. In

230
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,550
terms of that multiple woman that's now, but that

231
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,980
is again plotted on a logarithmic scale, the

232
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,980
dotted lines are the predictions of the CDM, but

233
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:37,860
more generally, what is predicted if. Not

234
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,560
relativistic dark matter exists. And the salad

235
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:48,190
line is from it's called modified gravity. The

236
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,180
idea that dark matter doesn't actually exist,

237
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,690
there's some change to Newton's laws of gravity

238
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,720
that has to be taken into account in large

239
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,540
cosmological scales to explain. Explain what

240
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,840
appears to be. Dark matter and things like

241
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:12,140
galactic rotation curves, and even 10 years ago

242
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,190
from these data, it was. Very strongly confirmed

243
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:23,190
that the data themselves are following the we're

244
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,190
in agreement with the predictions coming from

245
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,610
hypothesising dark matter and strongly ruling out

246
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,570
modifications to gravity that can explain other

247
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,110
evidence for dark matter, coming from galaxies, a

248
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:41,100
galaxy, clusters. So this is.

249
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,400
Really, what gives us confidence that dark matter

250
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,130
exists and allows a lot of research to continue to

251
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,580
go into figuring out precisely what that dark

252
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,750
matter consists of and how it interacts with the

253
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:04,180
ordinary. Of particles and fields that we are

254
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,030
familiar with. So that was a brief

255
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:16,680
introduction to that ongoing topic in modern

256
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,770
physics research, new questions about it before I

257
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,380
give you something more interesting to actually do

258
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,840
yourselves.

259
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:33,740
So.

260
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,870
And in the spirit of confronting.

261
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,550
Observations or experimental measurements with.

262
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,280
Predictions, this case predictions from

263
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,330
statistical physics

264
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,500
think it would be fun to. Step back a bit to kind

265
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:02,130
of things we were doing about a month ago, Unit

266
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:08,210
three on the economic loss of. We started

267
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,670
considering a solid system that was formed of

268
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,050
these spins that.

269
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,610
Soon to be oriented either up or down and

270
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,080
interacted with the magnetic field of strength

271
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,640
given by age. And forming a solid out of these

272
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,510
spins, which will allow us to distinguish between,

273
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,940
well, that allowed us to make the contrast between

274
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,300
distinguishable spins that are at a fixed location

275
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,900
in the solid and indistinguishable spins that are

276
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,410
in a gas allowed to move around so that they can't

277
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,890
be told apart by observation, observation we

278
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,900
computed be distinguishable case. That the energy

279
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:05,140
of a solid formed of energy spins was this simple,

280
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,630
hyperbolic tangent function of the inverse

281
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,880
temperature data helps make the field strength.

282
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,870
Which we can put into our calculations for our

283
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:21,310
definition of the heat capacity to get a

284
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:26,260
prediction from. Statistical physics to compare

285
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,850
with experimental measurements, which are the data

286
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:36,920
points on this figure, which those data are. Can

287
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,020
you tell me about 50 years old now, but suffice to.

288
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:45,200
Cover the temperature dependence of the heat

289
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,170
capacities for several different solid materials

290
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,330
level women and diamonds, both in the low

291
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,210
temperature regime with the heat capacity. It's

292
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,930
got to be very small to be banished to the limit

293
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:03,140
of absolute zero and the high temperature regime

294
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,920
leadership capacities all approach some constant

295
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:14,510
limiting factor. So the first exercise is to check

296
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,960
with the result that we have for the energy, how

297
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,700
well we can reproduce. These data points actually

298
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,870
mentioned that experimentally it's much easier to

299
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:30,940
measure the cost of pressure rather than how to

300
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,460
bowl. So as you increase the temperature we've

301
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,520
seen in the context of actual gases, for instance,

302
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,090
that the volume pressure, although those will tend

303
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,360
to increase. So you have to exert more force to

304
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,570
keep the volume constant for if you exert the same

305
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,490
amount of force, you end up with a variable. So

306
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,210
the sudden curves out here are for the heat

307
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,510
capacity, a constant volume, even though the data

308
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,370
points are for the capacity and pressure. The

309
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:07,000
effect of those two definitions of heat capacity

310
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,660
is something that we could ignore, at least for

311
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,210
our purposes.

312
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,990
And maybe I can.

313
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,080
Just pause the recording now to be five minutes to

314
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:33,480
compute that acetate and see how it compares to

315
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:40,280
the data points that are on this plot, at least in

316
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,340
their qualitative shape of dropping to zero at low

317
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,110
temperature and increasing to subcontinent's at

318
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,160
higher temperatures.

319
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,440
That was my favorite time going on. How are you

320
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,220
getting on with this is actually motivation for

321
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,970
the legal problems still to come up?

322
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:28,280
Do you have a. Expression for the heat capacity

323
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,020
from this energy.

324
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:43,200
They just let go of the system. So

325
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,150
let's be clear

326
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,700
in the public

327
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:00,120
square, the problems facing the nation that shows

328
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,020
up with the camera there.

329
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,320
So I agree with that, except for the negative side.

330
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:09,420
Which.

331
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,900
Because there are two ways to resolve that, one is

332
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,260
by changing the variables to differentiate to

333
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,470
better. The other is by the chamber with the one

334
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,320
over temperature and ability there and the

335
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,270
argument that you're not. So I think you see now

336
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,160
an agreement, several.

337
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,720
What to do with this will be my first and

338
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,040
time.

339
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,690
We think about the looks, I'm sure, which is

340
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,120
building increased temperatures close to infinity,

341
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,130
then this heat capacity reduces to

342
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,440
mean something on live off the factors of

343
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,820
proportionality. That's hyperbolic. Cosine square

344
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:16,950
is a sum of either the better age plus or minus

345
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,950
that age as being opposed to infinity that

346
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,030
exponentially dominates and we end up with

347
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,770
something better over the cumulative.

348
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,520
To the square, which does indeed go to zero zero

349
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,080
exponentially quickly in the inverse temperature,

350
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,150
so that these degrees with the zero emission

351
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,300
limits of these experiments, we measure heat

352
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,100
capacities.

353
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,110
Although I'll mention that the functional form of

354
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,030
exponential attendance is incorrect, but at least

355
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,510
it's getting the right limiting value of zero.

356
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,360
It's the high commission that's available in

357
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,090
Europe where things are more interesting here,

358
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:18,350
hyperbolic, cosine goes to one. Catchable.

359
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,760
Zero is one, and then we have just in Times Square,

360
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,450
each square

361
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,920
one goes to zero, in this case quite dramatically

362
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,630
in the universe temperature, which is not what is

363
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,130
measured experimentally. And in fact, there is an

364
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,350
even bigger issue that these experimental

365
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,340
measurements were done without any external by the

366
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:53,200
field at zero. So I guess the trigger response is

367
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,050
that capacity is always zero, that what we can

368
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,420
take that as a model for the functional form of

369
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:10,690
the heat capacity. And so we're going to pull up.

370
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,710
While we're working on that, but wasn't able to,

371
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,450
was the.

372
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,980
We thought plot of what? Was being predicted.

373
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,500
For some reason, it's not.

374
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:40,900
That is updating itself, the capacity normalize by

375
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:47,640
and so part of the sea over in versus either the

376
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:54,670
age or the temperature over age. So it's a simple

377
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:59,110
function once we put things in terms of X equals V

378
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:02,730
at a time stage. This is just X squared over the

379
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:08,110
sides where she was zero at the height of the

380
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,100
multimeter limits and changing the variables to

381
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,310
plot things in terms of the temperature like we

382
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:19,520
had from that experimental data. We see a nice

383
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,480
drop off to zero that's just too steep being

384
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,570
exponential rather than it turns out the

385
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,040
experimental measurements are best fit by a power

386
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:35,270
T cubed because you go to work for. But the big

387
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:38,420
issue is that as soon as the heat capacity.

388
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,200
Increases to a little under point five per

389
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,800
particle. That's exactly where the. Hyperbolic,

390
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:54,390
cosine undersecretary's starts to die off and one

391
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,310
over. Temperatures square from the famous square

392
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,390
starts to kick in and push things back down to

393
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,500
zero. In this case, the quadratic equations,

394
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,360
rather than exponential hopping back to what we

395
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,740
want to match, it doesn't match. Not even

396
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,470
qualitatively in that high temperature limit, and

397
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,360
this is not entirely due to the simplicity of

398
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,560
modeling solids is just upward or downward extends.

399
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:31,330
Somewhat of a silly or unrealistic model, even

400
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:37,520
with more or better justified models of solids.

401
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,990
The predictions for the heat capacity obtained

402
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,400
through classical statistical mechanics methods in

403
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:51,280
classical models of. The solids were not

404
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,100
reproducing. He capacity's that the experiment

405
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,700
measured even as late as the 18th or as early as

406
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,220
the eighteen hundreds. This was a known issue and

407
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,860
a fellow named Einstein attempted to address. With

408
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,090
some inspiration from his solution to the

409
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:13,780
photoelectric effect, which was another one of his

410
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:19,620
breakthroughs in his miracle, 019 of thoughts and

411
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:22,840
addition to showing that Brownian motion can be

412
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,680
explained on the basis of statistical physics, he

413
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,770
took one of the first steps towards quantum

414
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:34,210
mechanics by solving or proposing a solution to

415
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,700
puzzling experimental measurements known as the

416
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,200
electric effect, which don't have time to really

417
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,030
get into here. And it's not really relevant to

418
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:46,120
statistical physics. But the take away was the

419
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:52,430
proposal that. Energy had to be quantize in the

420
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:56,480
context of the interactions of lights and sirens

421
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,480
and just a couple of years later.

422
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,970
At the insights that taking a similar approach to

423
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:10,690
quantize the energies could help to resolve the

424
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,570
disagreement between these experimental heat

425
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:17,260
capacity measurements and classical theoretical

426
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:22,040
predictions, classical here being not quantum. So

427
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,540
the idea is maybe just.

428
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,730
Appreciate it. Again, with the picture rather than

429
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:36,370
a bunch of words there. This is the basic model

430
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,900
for a solid that he proposed where he tried to

431
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,230
simplify things as much as possible. By focusing

432
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:52,910
on. The. The energies that are at play rather than

433
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,490
the detailed balance of forces that is being

434
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,950
pictured is holding at odds with the solid in

435
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,820
place. This is just around the time the ads were

436
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,440
no longer being a theoretical construction or

437
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,820
turning into something that people thought

438
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,200
actually existed. So building a solid out of a

439
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,980
bunch of atoms is a regular array leads to the

440
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:21,080
question of how the atoms are fixed to their given

441
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:27,450
distinguishable positions. And the simple way of

442
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,480
bottling this is to say that all of these atoms

443
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,710
are interacting in some way with the atoms around

444
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:34,920
them.

445
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,350
So that whenever one tries to move, sort of is

446
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,240
pushed back by the adults around it, that's the

447
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,660
jagged lines here can be thought of kind of like

448
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,740
springs that are pulling all of the adults in

449
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,620
position. And then it becomes a very complicated

450
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,410
exercise to try to model how those atoms are

451
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,500
interacting with each other. We're all connected

452
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,800
to each other and that's independent, not

453
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:09,380
interested in degrees of freedom. So the idea is

454
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,170
ignore all of the details of interactions between

455
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,250
neighbouring atoms and just focus on the amount of

456
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,930
energy that's stored in each of these oscillators.

457
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:24,680
The.

458
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:30,870
The picture of the cell that's being proposed is

459
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:34,440
that. These interactions with these friends can be

460
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,830
represented as degrees of freedom that have some

461
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:42,300
energy and as I was growing up with that, that

462
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:46,410
could affect your proposal, is that the energy

463
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:50,640
that these oscillators have by virtue of the

464
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,460
interactions between neighboring atoms is

465
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,690
quantized. In terms of conservation times, some

466
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:01,870
characteristic frequency that is the same for all

467
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:06,740
of the oscillators in the cell, and this is. Well,

468
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,240
the fantastic simplification, because now, even

469
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,810
though we're modeling lots of interactions between

470
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:19,280
neighbouring particles, if we look at the physics

471
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,010
of the oscillators themselves, those are not

472
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:25,310
interactive degrees of freedom. And we can analyze

473
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:29,810
them using the statistical physics methods we've

474
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:35,000
produced up till now particularly. We can start

475
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:39,710
already in the canonical example.

476
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:47,250
By. Fixing the overall energy that is present in

477
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,880
the south, it's going to be dependent on

478
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,830
temperature, will be solid as gas, whatever that

479
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,620
temperature is, if some amount of energy that can

480
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,910
be distributed among the and different oscillators

481
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,790
in the system. I mentioned in passing that the

482
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:08,480
oscillators depend both on the number of atoms

483
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,980
that there are, as well as how they are laid out.

484
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,200
So can this square lattice, there are two

485
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:20,090
independent possibilities for each atom, and that

486
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,610
could rise to three independent oscillators per

487
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:26,600
atom, three dimensional cubic lattice. It's also

488
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,480
three different lattice structures that have

489
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,090
different members of your neighbors. Things like

490
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,630
the honeycomb lattice that shows up in graphene,

491
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:39,080
for instance, has somewhat different counting in

492
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,740
this. Setting that aside for the moment and

493
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:47,180
working in terms of a fixed number of oscillators.

494
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,110
So that will be our end rather than the number of

495
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:55,340
atoms. They can go through sort of four step

496
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,720
process to get from the definition of the small.

497
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:05,450
In the microeconomic ensemble to capacity, as

498
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:09,750
usual, I've gone on longer than I expected with

499
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,120
the introduction of things today, so Will. Just.

500
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:22,180
They believe a lot of the detailed work for you to

501
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:26,260
work on over the coming week and dive back into

502
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,280
this just before the break. Next week.

503
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:32,750
Maybe even.

504
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,880
When they police say. We're just a complete

505
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,850
misrepresentation of the calculation at hand in

506
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:48,550
the microcosmic ensemble. We're fixing the amount

507
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:52,420
of energy which we divide into some number of

508
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,390
these quanta, each with units of mega.

509
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:02,430
And the first question is, what is the total

510
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:07,350
number of microstates that designed ISIS can have

511
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:11,190
with that fixed amount of energy being distributed

512
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:16,440
among a fixed amount of oscillators? So this case

513
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,090
is an integer counting the units of.

514
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,100
Quantize energy levels can be distributed among

515
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,850
all the oscillators and then from the total number

516
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,270
of microstates going through the same sort of

517
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:38,570
calculations that we've done over the. First of

518
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:41,960
all, to this cause, we can extract the entropy,

519
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:47,900
the temperature and energy and from there and

520
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,280
ultimately the heat capacity to be compared with

521
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:59,930
experiment. So. Just stop there. Get started in

522
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,720
the next five minutes or save this

523
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:08,540
free time over the coming week, in the end,

524
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,870
hopefully you should see a significant improvement

525
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:20,050
compared to. What we had from the system, but room

526
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,350
for further improvement will turn out to be

527
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:23,430
possible.

528
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,760
You may get into that. Once we start possibly next

529
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:37,750
week, so. Just wrap up the recording and leave you

530
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,020
with this problem for the next five minutes plus

531
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:46,230
five days, are there any questions about the setup

532
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:51,490
that we should clarify it before you? We'll get to

533
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:51,660
it.

534
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,030
One check of the work that she neglected to

535
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:55,090
mention is. It's comparing predictions with I it a

536
00:40:55,110 --> 00:41:01,200
minimal three hospital system. We can set up.

537
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:08,730
Three atoms, each pair of them connected by one of

538
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:14,790
these oscillators. That's. It's simple enough that.

539
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,190
For the small.

540
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:25,580
Number of energy units can be checked explicitly

541
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,160
that the total number of microstates matches

542
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:34,300
functional form in terms of and hoc.
